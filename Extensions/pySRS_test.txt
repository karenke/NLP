didnt think id settle anything less kind comic book adaptation almost never see one combines rousing heroic action solid story <>
{} joy astonishment thats exactly got <>
xmen great comic book movie actually pretty good movie period <>
unfamiliar source material xmen mutants humans unusual powers manifest puberty <>
telepathic mutant professor charles xavier patrick stewart dedicated helping mutants learn cope powers school gifted youngsters mutants like retractable clawwielding wolverine hugh jackman teenager called rogue anna paquin absorbs life force people touches <>
xavier also powerful adversary magneto ian mckellen sees mutants destined superiority believes mass humanity fears hates mutantkind <>
seems magnetos perspective justified us senator robert kelly bruce davison begins advocating mutants register government <>
magneto brotherhood mutants set motion plan mutate humanity bet battle xaviers xmen far <>
{} xmen universe grown pretty unwieldy years director bryan singer usual suspects team writers wisely keep focus limited number characters team leader cyclops james marsden telekinetic jean grey famke janssen weather manipulator storm halle berry <>
even wisely focuses primarily wolverine paternal relationship fragile frightened rogue <>
choice gives story emotional anchor gives plenty screen time xmens intriguing character easily best performance <>
youve probably never seen australian actor hugh jackman though resembles brawnier gary sinise see guy charisma burn <>
jackman offers everything fan could hope portrayal wolverine trademark muttonchops genuine sense mystery menace <>
xmen nothing else going jackman would still worth seeing <>
{} wonderful thing xmen going <>
drawing one comics best stories xmen effectively uses subtext antimutant hysteria combination red scare theres great moment senate debate kelly waves around list names known mutants racism homophobia <>
offers dozens insider gags xmen faithful avoiding slavish devotion every detail interfere solid film storytelling <>
case matters anyone offers kickassinest action scenes side matrix <>
climactic battle xmen brotherhood including shapeshifter mystique rebecca romijnstamos tongueflicker toad ray park bonecrusher sabretooth tyler mane simply superb <>
fact dont wade minutes junk get wonderful bonus <>
{} course xmen flaws <>
theres much halle berry look intense eyes go white probably best given incredible disappearing accent occasionally employs <>
script also doesnt quite enough turning magneto genuinely tragic villain especially given amount time devoted backstory prologue <>
always tough film like xmen lay foundation still delivering goods inevitable going lulls loose ends <>
startled however <>
maybe inner adolescent fanboy emerge xmen emerged film reminded best comic book offer well best action film offer <>
think worth wait though sneaking suspicion wont years xmen hit screen <>

doesnt add much either character study crime drama take straightest path two points <>
merely lazy crazy consistently amusing diversion place know true measure man woman youve gone fishing together <>
place altman might consider visiting often <>
