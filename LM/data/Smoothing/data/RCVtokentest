Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd is expected to report on Thursday a stagnant net profit for the year to June 30 , held back by soaring newsprint costs and losses from its burgeoning Star TV operations , analysts said.The median forecast in BZW 's BARCEPS broker survey is for a A $ 1.343 billion net profit before abnormals for the year , a virtual replica of the A $ 1.342 billion profit posted in 1994/95.Analysts said News may even struggle to match last year 's result , particularly given its lower than expected third quarter result .
It 's got to be a reasonably strong last quarter to match that ( 1994/95 ) figure , said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett media analyst John Bell.I doubt there 'll be many surprises on the upside , he said.News posted a A $ 281 million net profit before abnormals in the third quarter , below expectations of about A $ 300 million and taking profits for the first nine months of the year to A $ 944 million.The result is expected around 8.30 a.m. Australian time on Thursday ( 2230 GMT Wednesday ) .
Analysts said News ' 1995/96 profits had been restrained generally by the higher paper costs , a U.K. cover price war and continued losses from its Star TV operation in Hong Kong.People will look at newspapers because that will reflect higher newsprint prices and the impact of the newspaper price war , said one Melbourne media analyst.Margins on News ' British newspapers were seen pressured in the final few months of the year by cover price discounts ahead of the Olympics.There was a little bit of renewed competition on the Monday cover prices pre-Olympics , Bell said .
Margins may have slipped a little bit in the last few months of the year , he said.Star TV was seen pumping out another US $ 90 million to US $ 100 million of losses for the year as it establishes itself in the potentially lucrative Asian satellite television markets.I would expect a full year loss of US $ 90 million given what we 've been told so far and I 've seen nothing to change that , the Melbourne analyst said.I would see it somewhere in excess of of US $ 100 million , Bell said .
Continued strong earnings from U.S. television and films are seen offsetting somewhat the newsprint and Star TV losses.Looking ahead however , analysts are confident News ' profits can start growing again in 1996/97 , boosted by potentially lower newsprint prices and an earnings surge from the hit U.S. special effects movie , Independence Day .
'Independence Day ' could add up to US $ 200 million to the bottom line , said Bell , who forecast net profit rising to A $ 1.5 billion in 1996/97 .
The 1996/97 result will show some clear profit growth as much as anything because of paper prices and 'Independence Day ' , the Melbourne analyst said , who forecast a A $ 1.6 billion net profit.News ' share price was down one cent at A $ 6.49 at 2.00 p.m. ( 0400 GMT ) . -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 Local billionaire Kerry Packer faces an uphill battle to overcome political opposition and a high asking price if he wants to take over Australia 's oldest publisher , John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.Speculation has simmered for months that Australia 's biggest television station owner will launch a takeover bid for Fairfax as soon as the government eased cross-media rules set up by the former Labor government.Comments by Prime Minister John Howard last week that Fairfax needed an owner like Packer fanned that speculation into talk of an imminent easing of the rules and an inevitably successful takeover bid.Analysts said on Tuesday however that a successful Packer bid for Fairfax , which publishes three of Australia 's most profitable daily newspapers , was not such a sure thing.Growing political opposition from within Howard 's conservative Liberal-National coalition and a hostile Senate have made any Howard plan look more fragile.There 's a few more hurdles to overcome yet , said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett senior media analyst Vince Pepe.Getting ( Prime Minister John ) Howard to introduce legislation is one thing , but getting it through parliament while keeping his backbench appeased is another thing , Pepe said.The amount of political fallout that 's beginning might see him wondering whether it is such a clever thing after all.Howard 's cabinet was considering on Tuesday changes to the cross-media rules that stop television station owners like Packer from buying a major newspaper group like Fairfax.Howard has already said the rules are outdated and his government is widely expected to drop them , allowing Packer to use his current 15 percent stake as a beachhead for a full scrip-based takeover bid.But Howard 's position has come under increasing fire in recent days after Seven Network Ltd Chairman Kerry Stokes accused Howard of having done what he called a disgraceful deal with Packer that would concetrate media ownership into the hands of just two men.A successful Packer takeover of Fairfax would mean Australia 's major newspapers would be divided between Packer and Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd.A controversial independent senator , Mal Colston , threw up another roadblock in front of any media law changes earlier on Tuesday , threatening to vote against the government.The fine balance in the Senate means if Colston votes against the government , the balance of power transfers to the left-leaning Democrat and Green senators , who have said they oppose any further concentration of media ownership.Analysts also said Packer may baulk at having to pay the A $ 3.0 billion ( US $ 2.35 billion ) needed to convince some large entrenched shareholders to bail out Fairfax.Packer may also struggle to convince his fellow shareholders in the bid vehicle , Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd , to swallow the earnings dilution such a bid would create.Despite Packer 's apparent obsession for Fairfax , he 's not going to pay a stupid price for it and some people in the market are expecting a stupid price , said another analyst.I 'd be a pretty disappointed PBL shareholder if he was prepared to pay more than A $ 3.40 ( a share ) for it , the analyst said , adding that a A $ 3.40 price would be earnings dilutive given Fairfax 's forecast earnings .
Fairfax 's shares closed down two cents at A $ 3.23 on Tuesday .
( A $ = US $ 0.78 ) Newspaper , magazine and radio group Rural Press Ltd said on Thursday that it was not confident of the economic turnaround needed to increase its profit for the full year to June 30 , 1997.My personal view is that we 're some time away from some significant turnaround ... in the consumer markets and in real estate , managing director Brian McCarthy told Reuters.I ca n't see much improvement up to the middle of the year at the earliest , McCarthy said in an Interview .
Earlier Rural Press announced a four percent rise in net profit for the six months to December to A $ 16.96 million and set an unchanged dividend of four cents per share.But Rural Press also warned that trading in the first five weeks of the second half had been below last year and that it needed an improvement in the economy to continue its history of profit rises for the full year.McCarthy said earnings before interest and tax would have fallen marginally in the half year if they had been compared on a like-for-like basis before the effects of acquisitions .
McCarthy said the slight profit fall on a like-for-like basis was a reflection of weak real estate and retail sectors , which provide the bulk of Rural Press ' advertising income.The retailing industry is very flat to the point of depressed .
There 's not a lot of activity in the real estate sectors and they are our key sources of revenue , he said.We think we 're doing all of the things that have to be done internally , but it 's a very hard external environment that we 're looking at today , he added .
In the framework in which we operate , we do n't see it as a disappointing result .
McCarthy said that given the tough economic outlook , there was not going to a major second half recovery in Rural Press ' revenues.He said it was unlikely that Rural Press ' final dividend would fall.However Rural Press , despite the operational pressure , remained keen to acquire new businesses , McCarthy said.We 're still very , very keen to keep growing and acquiring , he said , adding that Rural Press had facilities in place to allow acquisitions worth up to A $ 50 million .
Rural Press ' share price closed unchanged at A $ 4.10 , despite the market 's one percent rise overall to a record high. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 Australia 's Westpac Banking Corp , struggling like its fellow major banks to cope with a savage interest margin squeeze , surprised analysts on Wednesday by posting a strong profit rise in the first half year.Higher income from bank account and transaction fees and a series of property sale profits more than offset the squeeze on home lending margins , boosting net profit for the six months to March 31 by 12.9 percent to A $ 638 million ( US $ 496 million ) .Westpac increased its interim dividend to 19 cents from 16 cents after earnings per share ( EPS ) rose to 34.4 cents from 29.2 cents .
The EPS rise was helped by a share buy-back.Analysts had expected a profit of about A $ 610 million after Westpac warned late last year about the margin squeeze and foreshadowed flat profits.The market however had in recent weeks has taken a more optimistic view of the likely profit result than the analysts , boosting Westpac 's share price 16 percent in the last month.That 's why the stock has n't bounced as much as you 'd expect it to , Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said.Westpac 's shares closed down five cents at A $ 7.45 after a rise straight after the result to A $ 7.60.Westpac Managing Director Bob Joss welcomed the profit rise as a solid result , but said it would be difficult to repeat the 12.9 percent rise in the second half because of what he said was a tremendous squeeze on lending margins.I think that it will be very hard to do in the second half given the margin pressures that we 're seeing through all parts of our product range , Westpac Managing Director Bob Joss told a news conference.Joss said however he expected the full year profit for the year to September 30 would be higher than the A $ 1.132 billion posted in 1995/96.Australia 's major banks have been forced in the last year to cut about 150 basis points off their home lending margins by red hot competition from non-banks that are funded by mortgage origination .
These mortgage originators have snared about 10 to 12 percent of the Australian market in the last three years.Westpac 's group net interest margin fell to 3.55 percent in the six months to March 31 from 3.75 percent in the six months to September , which cost Westpac about A $ 88 million in the half.Westpac 's increases in bank fees and charges had not fully offset the effect of this margin squeeze , Joss said .
Westpac 's accounts showed Westpac 's account keeping and transaction fee income rose to A $ 379 million from A $ 306 million a year earlier.There 's constant pressure on margins so there 's a test to do the best we can on fees , on lowering costs and increasing efficiencies , Joss said .
( A $ = US $ 0.7775 ) The Sydney 2000 Olympics does not appear to be generating the economic bonanza many had hoped for and will not boost Sydney house prices , two construction and real estate forecasters said on Tuesday.The impact of the Olympics has n't been as great as we 'd been led to believe , Knight Frank Independent director Philip Ragan told a Committee for Economic Development of Australia ( CEDA ) seminar.Construction of the games facilities and preparations for the games were in full swing , but were not yet adding significantly to the economy , Ragan said.In 1993 , when the Sydney was awarded the games , analysts forecast that the extra construction , tourism and jobs generated by the games would cumulatively add A $ 7 billion ( US $ 5.3 billion ) to A $ 8 billion to gross domestic product by 2001.Ragan said the cumulative economic effect was likely to be closer to A $ 3 billion because of cost over-runs , lower revenue projections and the leakage of sponsorship revenues offshore.The outcome is coming in at the low end of expectations , in fact , significantly lower , Ragan said.Olympics-related job creation had originally been estimated at about 150,000 , but only 800 specific jobs had been created so far and only about 2,800 temporary jobs were seen in 2000 , he said.The state government and various private consortia are expected to spend about A $ 3.2 billion building new facilities.But Ragan said this amount spent over four years was not a major increase on the A $ 10 billion spent each year on such construction in Sydney.An expected nine percent rise in state government revenues and a trend towards higher savings would also swamp the Olympic-led boost to the local economy , he said.The effect of the Olympics is being more than overshadowed by other changes happening in the economy , he said.BIS Schrapnel building and construction director Robert Mellor said he expected Sydney property prices to rise almost 40 percent in the lead up to the year 2000 and then slide in the years immediately after the Olympics.But Mellor said this would have happened regardless of Sydney having the Olympics.It 's got nothing to do with the Olympics .
I do n't see it having any effect , Mellor told the CEDA seminar.The positives may not be as great as the econometric models may indicate , he said.The Atlanta Olympics had shown retailers and street traders had not done nearly as well as expected , Mellor said.He pointed to the recent rash of legal actions by Atlanta 's Olympic vendors against organisers for promising unrealistic likely incomes.Those residential areas very close to the games site at Homebush Bay in Sydney 's Western Suburbs may benefit from the new recreational facilities built there , but the bulk of Sydney 's housing market would not notice.He said the prospect of some home owners being able to rent out their homes for A $ 1,000 or A $ 2,000 for two weeks was unlikely to provide a general boost to the market.It just does n't change the fundamental reason for buying a house in Sydney , he said .
( A $ =US $ 0.7590 ) Analysts expectations that New Zealand-based whitegoods manufacturer Fisher and Paykel Ltd would post a slightly lower profit in 1996/97 were about right , chief executive Gary Paykel said on Thursday.I 've been reading some of the local analysts reports and I think they 've got it pretty right , Paykel told Reuters in an interview while in Australia opening an expanded factory.He said was referring to research reports from J.B .
Were , Hendry Hay McIntosh and others forecasting a lower profit in the year to March 31 .
They 're not far off the mark , he said.They 're just saying that with the tough trading conditions it does look as if it will be a little bit less than probably last year.He said Fisher and Paykel itself could not make a forecast , but that the analysts were about right.Some analysts have forecast Fisher and Paykel 's full year net profit would fall to about NZ $ 38 million from the NZ $ 39.25 million posted in 1995/96 .
Fisher and Paykel reported a first half net profit of NZ $ 19.2 million in early November and forecast then that full year profits would similar to or slightly better than in 1995/96.Paykel said that New Zealand market conditions were tough and Fisher and Paykel had been hurt by the loss of an exclusive distribution agreement with appliance retailer Noel Leeming.That is impacting on sales -- not to the extent that we thought it would -- but obviously they were about 15 percent of sales in New Zealand and that takes some time to make up , he said .
Fisher and Paykel had signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Australian-based retailer Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd for their yet-to-be opened New Zealand stores and was hopeful this would prove successful.It ( the New Zealand market ) is very tough now and I do n't see the market coming back too much this calendar year , but the NZ fundamentals are still good and things will pick up gradually -- but not this year.Conditions in the Australian whitegoods market , where Fisher and Paykel has a market share in the low 20 percent range , were looking better , he said .
Fisher and Paykel was strongest in the higher quality washing machine market sectors in Australia , where it currently had a 40 percent share , Paykel said.It was weaker in the oven , refrigeration , dishwashing and budget washing machine parts of the market , where it had generally had less than 20 percent market share.But Paykel said the opening of an expanded factory in Brisbane and the launch of several new products in Australia would boost its market share in these sectors.He said Fisher and Paykel had just launched a budget model washing machine in Australia retailing for about A $ 649 each .
It 's a real competitive , agrressive move and let 's see what our competitors do , he said.Fisher and Paykel 's major Australian competitors , Email Ltd and Southcorp Holdings Ltd , offer models with prices of A $ 499 to A $ 599.We think they 're ( prices ) as low as they can go , and if that 's the case we 'll see a lot of volume given its features , he said , adding he hoped Fisher and Paykel could raise its share of the budget market to 40 percent.Fisher and Paykel 's share price closed unchanged at NZ $ 5.15 on Thursday .
-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 The Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( CBA ) announced a surprisingly strong 11 percent rise in first half profits on Wednesday as a 33 percent surge in business lending more than offset a further squeeze in home loan margins.Business volumes during the first half of 1996/97 were pleasing , leading to a better than expected interim result , CBA managing director David Murray told a news conference.This likely to lead to a slightly better than expected full year result , Murray said .
CBA 's net profit for the six months to December 31 rose to A $ 602 million from A $ 542 million in the comparable six months a year earlier.CBA had itself been saying until now that it expected competition in its key home loan market would squeeze home loan margins and keep profits flat in the year to June 30 , 1997.Analysts too had expected a subdued profit performance , forecasting a profit of between A $ 535 million and A $ 560 million.CBA 's shares rallied sharply on the profit and on news of a interim dividend of 45 cents per share , up seven cents on the previous interim dividend .
CBA 's shares were up 47 cents at A $ 13.88 at 3.50 p.m. ( 0450 GMT ) , helping to drive the share market overall to a new record high .
Obviously the market liked it .
The profit was probably about A $ 50 million above expectations and there was a nice increase in the dividend , said Lance Jones dealer Hamish Dee.CBA said the launch of its Business Asset Finance and Capital Business Card products in July and October 1996 had attracted significant new business .
But CBA dampened optimism about its business lending boom by cutting its varible home mortgage rates by up to 0.7 of a percentage point , ensuring further margin pressure on Australia 's largest home lender.It will narrow the margins further , Murray said.CBA 's group net interest margin fell to 3.71 percent in the first half of 1996/96 , compared with 4.12 percent and 4.10 percent respectively in the first and second halves of 1995/96.This is CBA 's second unilateral home loan interest rate cut in less than a year .
The bank cut its key variable home loan rate to 9.9 percent from 10.5 percent in May .
That cut triggered a round of mortgage rate cuts by the other major banks and was generally seen as the catalyst to a 50 to 75 basis point cut in big bank home loan margins.It cut its key variable rate to 7.55 percent on Wednesday.Murray was reluctant to predict that the CBA would sustain the 11 percent profit rise through the full year because of the expected margin squeeze , saying only that 1996/97 was likely to be a little better than the previously expected flat result.He said the latest home loan cuts had more to do with increasingly aggressive competition in the home loan market than with any pre-emption of another cut in official cash rates .
It 's true that this move has got more to do with the structure of home loan interest rates in Australia than it has to do with our view about monetary policy , he said.CBA also said its efforts to control costs and increase productivity were a factor in the the better than expected profit .
CBA 's cost to income ratio fell to 60.3 percent from 60.9 percent and would have been 59.5 percent if not for CBA 's buy-back of 10 percent of its shares from the government.Meanwhile the CBA confirmed that it was looking closely at securitising some of its mortgage portfolio and that it was not looking at issuing a special dividend .
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) chairman Allan Fels said on Thursday that he had a neutral attitude about Westpac Banking Corp 's A $ 1.435 billion bid for Bank of Melbourne Ltd.Fels also confirmed that he had told Westpac informally two years ago that the anti-monopoly regulator would be hesitant to allow a Westpac takeover of the smaller regional bank.However , he said that the ACCC acknowledged then that structural change may occur to allow such a takeover at a future date .
We have a neutral attitude , Fels told Reuters in an interview.We look at mergers on a case-by-case basis at the time they happen .
We 're awaiting a submission on it and we 'll be doing market inquiries , Fels said.Fels said the earlier informal talks occurred in September 1995 when Westpac sought ACCC for approval for its takeover of Perth-based Challenge Bank .
During that time we discussed with Westpac wider issues about regional mergers in general .
Obviously that touched on wider possibilities then just Westpac-Challenge , Fels said.We then issued a statement which by implication made it look as if we would have quite a bit of hesitation about Westpac-Bank of Melbourne , however there was no formal proposal put to us , he said.At that time we would have been hesitant had a formal proposition been put .
Fels said , however , the commission took the unusual step of saying that this hesitation about Westpac-Bank of Melbourne only applied at that time.We did say at the time very explicitly that this was our view at THAT time , he said.We said that a couple of times , we do n't normally say that sort of thing.We were signalling that we were aware that this matter would at some point have to be looked at again because people keep arguing that there 's been structural change in the market .
Fels was careful not to state whether he thought there had been structural change since 1995.That 's what 's been put to us by the parties , he said.There 've been changes ( generally ) , but we have n't really evaluated their impact , he said , adding he remained neutral on the question of structural change.But later he told ABC radio he did not agree currently with those arguing there had been relevant , significant structural change in the regional banking sector.The question is : has there been a change of circumstance .
The parties argue 'Yes .
' We have n't , certainly , taken that view at this time but we will look at their submissions , he said.Fels said it would take the ACCC at least a month to make its decision and would take the Wallis inquiry 's report into account , but would not be bound by it.Earlier Westpac said it would present a strong case that the takeover was pro-competitive.The two banks said they would merge their retail operations in Victoria and trade under the Bank of Melbourne brand name with local management .
-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 The U.S.-Australian development of the giant Bayu-Undan gas field in the Timor Sea cleared its biggest hurdle on Wednesday when BHP Petroleum and Phillips Petroleum agreed that BHP should be the sole operator.Joint venture participants said the agreement meant they could now consider exactly how to develop the A $ 4 billion field and whether to build a liquified natural gas ( LNG ) processing plant onshore near Darwin in the Northern Territory or build such a floating plant .
This agreement is the most fundamental development in terms of defining the project , said Petroz NL Finance Manager Rob Crook.The field , which was last estimated to have proven and probable reserves of 3.1 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , is straddled by two joint venture groups.It 's a very , very large world-scale discovery , said Petroz ' Crook.Getting the two groups to agree on who would operate the facilities needed to jointly exploit the field and how the proceeds would be divided up was a crucial step , Crook said .
The Bayu side of the field is covered by the Zone of Cooperation Agreement ( ZOCA ) 91-13 is owned by a Phillips-led joint venture that includes Oryx Energy Co of the U.S. with 25 percent and Britain 's Hardy Oil & amp ; Gas Plc with 15 percent .
Phillips has 60 percent.The Undan side of the field covered by ZOCA 91-12 is owned by a BHP-led joint venture which includes Petroz with 13.371 percent , Santos Ltd with 21.426 percent and Indonesia 's Inpex Sahul with 21.21 percent .
BHP has 42.417 percent .
The ZOCAs were made possible by a treaty between Australia and Indonesia and are a key factor in the relatively warm diplomatic ties between the two neighbours.BHP said meetings of joint venture participants in Melbourne late last week had selected BHP Petroleum as the unit operator of the field .
BHP Petroleum is a unit of the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd , Australia 's largest company and the half-owner of the Bass Strait oil fields off the Victorian coast.The single field extends across both contract areas and any development will be carried out under the framework of a unitisation agreement and utilise shared facilities , BHP said .
Petroz said in a separate statement the joint venturers had decided on the upstream liquids and condensate phase of the project , but had yet to decide on where the downstream LNG plant would be located.The upstream phase of the project consists of a liquids stripping/gas recycling operation whereby condensate and LPG ( Liquid Petroleum Gas ) are separated from the gas stream offshore and transported by tankers to market , Petroz said.It is expected that the offshore liquids recovery project will be integrated with an LNG production facility , it said .
Both offshore and onshore locations for the LNG facilities are under consideration , it said.The development of the field was expected to start in 1998 , leading to the first production of condensate and LPG in 2001.Petroz 's Crook said the upstream condensate and LPG facility already decided on had been estimated to cost around A $ 1.5 billion to build .
He said it was envisaged the field would produce about 3-4 tcf , 230 million barrels of gas condensate and 130 million barrels of LPG.The field is split about 60-40 percent in favour of the BHP-led joint venture , he said .
Northern Territory ministers are confident that BHP and Phillips will choose an onshore LNG plant with a 470 km pipeline to bring the gas from the Timor Sea .
Reports have put the cost of such a plant at between A $ 1 billion to A $ 1.9 billion.Phillips is seen favouring an onshore plant while BHP has favoured an offshore plant .
An onshore plant would produce an estimated three million tonnes of LNG a year. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 Bank of Melbourne Ltd announced on Thursday it had agreed to a A $ 1.435 billion takeover bid by Westpac Banking Corp that valued the Victorian-based bank at 2.1 times net assets.The two banks said they would merge their retail operations in Victoria and trade under the Bank of Melbourne brand name with local management , subject to the approval of Treasurer Peter Costello and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) .
Westpac said it would offer A $ 9.75 for each Bank of Melbourne ordinary share , including a full franked 90 cent per share special dividend.Shareholders had a choice of receiving the A $ 8.85 balance in cash or in the form of one Westpac share plus up to A $ 1.85 in cash , it said.Westpac would offer A $ 15.36 in cash for each converting preference share or a combination of Westpac shares and cash to a maximum of A $ 1.36.The offer represented an earnings multiple of 15.2 times 1997 prospective earnings as forecast by Barceps .
This represented 2.1 times net assets which was comparable to the 2.1 times net assets paid by St George Bank for Advance Bank and the 2.1 times net assets paid by Westpac to Challenge shareholders , Bank of Melbourne said.Bank of Melbourne and Westpac , who must convince the ACCC that their merger does not lessen competition in Victoria , said they would present a strong pro-competitive case to the ACCC.Our regional banking approach will ensure Bank of Melbourne becomes a stronger competitive force in Victoria and retains its local indentity , Westpac Managing Director Bob Joss said .
This approach which was established in Western Australia and New Zealand will provide the framework for Victoria in delivering local product and marketing discretion , local credit decision making with Westpac 's overall credit policy guidelines , local personnel management and local community sponsorship , Joss said.The ACCC has previously said it would not allow a merger that left a state market without a significant regional bank and the ACCC reportedly rejected an informal merger approach by the two banks two years ago .
The ACCC said they would carefully examine the latest merger proposal over the next several weeks .
Meanwhile , the Treasurer Peter Costello said he would not even consider the merger application until he had released the official Wallis Inquiry into financial market regulation and the government had considered its response .
This could take months.Any application for a merger between Westpac and the Bank of Melbourne will be determined in accordance with that policy , policy as announced in response to the Wallis report , Costello told reporters in Canberra.The application will not be dealt with until that policy is announced and it will be determined in accordance with that policy .
Market reaction to the merger deal was mixed , but analysts said it appeared fair and was likely to succeed.I think they would have both done their homework beforehand and I think it will be successful , said Merrill Lynch Australia bank analyst Hayden Aspinall.Bank of Melbourne shares jumped 95 cents to A $ 9.75 as soon as trade started but had drifted back to A $ 9.44 by 3.30 p.m. ( 0530 GMT ) .
Westpac 's shares initially jumped nine cents to A $ 6.96 , but has since settled to be two cents down at A $ 6.85 .
Late on Thursday , Standard and Poor 's Corp said it had affirmed the AA-minus long term and A1 plus short term counterparty ratings for Westpac and placed the A-minus long term and A2 short term counterparty ratings for the Bank of Melbourne on creditWatch positive. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 A key consultant 's report on Tuesday shed more light on how tampering occurred at the worthless Busang gold project in Indonesia , once touted by Canada 's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. as the strike of the century.While shareholders bailed out of the former stock market darling on Tuesday , investigators and analysts were trying to figure out how the country 's biggest swindle could have happened.Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. , the firm hired by Bre-X that delivered a devastating audit of Busang on Sunday , gave some clues in its full interim report released on Tuesday.Strathcona said its experts initially found it hard to believe that tampering could have happened on such a grand scale .
Bre-X 's last resource estimate of 71 million ounces of gold at Busang was based on data pulled from 16,400 samples.But after a month-long study , Strathcona said there appears to be little alternative but to conclude that virtually all the gold in the samples submitted by Bre-X for assaying has originated from some other source.Bre-X 's storage warehouse near the Borneo town of Samarinda , where core samples were kept for a lengthy period of time , was the most likely spot for any tampering , the report said.Under Bre-X 's system , the core samples from the Busang site were shipped by boat to Samarinda and then trucked to Balikpapan for assaying .
The samples spent several weeks at Samarinda before they were sent to Indo Assay Laboratories in Balikpapan.Strathcona said the precision of tampering was impressive .
It suggested those involved had detailed knowledge of the region and how to add the right amounts of gold to match the site 's geology.We can only suggest that somewhere enroute , probably at Samarinda , there has been a laboratory or facilities established that have allowed very precise additions of the foreign gold , the report said.The report also revealed that Bre-X officials had studies last November that showed serious abnormalities in its Busang gold find.During its audit , Strathcona reviewed a feasibility review by Kilborn SNC-Lavalin Inc. and a metallurgical study performed by Australia 's Normet Pty Ltd .
Both studies were commissioned by Bre-X.Strathcona said it was struck by Normet 's statement that more than 90 percent of the gold in Bre-X 's Busang samples were consistent with alluvial , or river , gold .
Busang is considered a bedrock deposit.Before Sunday 's devastating news , Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh had dismissed doubts about Busang that had dogged his company since March .
He said he was shocked by Strathcona 's report and vowed to find the culprits.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has investigators from its commercial crime unit studying the Strathcona report , but no formal probe had been launched , it said.Rumours about Busang surfaced in March when Busang chief geologist Michael de Guzman allegedly jumped it to his death from a helicopter while flying to a meeting with Bre-X partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper & amp ; Gold Inc. , a big mining company based in New Orleans.Freeport had summoned de Guzman to explain why Bre-X 's estimates of 71 million ounces of gold at Busang did not match Freeport 's findings.About a week after de Guzman 's death , as rumours about Freeport 's findings pounded Bre-X 's stock , the Toronto Stock Exchange asked Freeport to issue a statement.Freeport stunned investors on March 26 when the company said its preliminary tests found insignificant amounts of gold .
Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona to audit the project.The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares on March 27 , wiping almost C $ 3 billion ( $ 2.1 billion ) from the company 's market value in one day.Freeport and an Indonesian company said on Monday they planned to pull out of the Busang project.Bre-X 's stock plunged C $ 3.17 to C6 cents in frenzied action after it resumed trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange ( TSE ) on Tuesday .
Bre-X 's stock value had once topped C $ 6 billion ( $ 4.4 billion ) .Investors are very disenchanted .
Very disappointed and they 're selling it just to get it off their backs , Ira Katzin , an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities , said on Tuesday.The legal fallout from the Busang bust continued on Tuesday with another class action suit filed against Bre-X Minerals , raising the number of suits against Bre-X to at least nine.New York law firm Wechsler Harwood Halebian & amp ; Feffer LLP said it was seeking to recover damages for shareholders hurt by the Bre-X selloff .
Strippers can dance naked in Canada as long as they keep their distance from the customers.Exotic dancers on Thursday cheered a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that bans lap dancing , but club owners warned it would turn off customers and put some establishments out of business.I think it 's great .
Dancing is for seeing , not touching , said a dancer at Filmores , a well-known Toronto strip club.Canada 's top court ruled on Wednesday that lap dancing -- sitting naked on a customer 's lap and rubbing against him -- was indecent and a criminal act.Andy , a lunchtime patron at the Zanzibar strip club on Toronto 's seedy Yonge Street , said the court ban was unnecessary.The only thing criminal about it is if prostitution is involved .
Some girls just take it too far , said the apprentice electrician as a dancer gyrated on the stage behind him.Canada 's lap-dance brouhaha began in 1994 when an Ontario judge ruled that a variety of sexual acts at a Toronto strip club did not offend community standards.After the ruling , lap dancing quickly spread to other clubs across the country.A former stripper , Katharine Goldberg , led a public crusade against lap dancing , arguing that some dancers were forced by club owners to masturbate customers and perform other acts.This should end the suffering of so many young women and protect the health and lives of many people , Goldberg said.But Canadian newspapers have quoted other strippers who resented Goldberg 's potrayal of them as sex slaves .
Most customers obeyed the no-touch rule and it was more lucrative than table dancing , they said.A lap dance can cost up to $ 20 each with some dancers taking home between $ 300 and $ 500 a night.The Supreme Court upheld an appeal court decision that overturned the original 1994 court ruling .
The appeals judge said lap dancing degraded dancers and encouraged clients to treat women as sexual objects .
David Walsh , the maverick Canadian embroiled in world 's biggest gold fiasco , always dreamed of striking it rich.Under siege since doubts about Busang deposit surfaced in late March , Walsh had dismissed the conspiracy and tampering theories that have dogged his company Bre-X Minerals Ltd. -- until now.We share the shock and dismay our of shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there , Walsh said after his company released a devastating report on Busang on Sunday.In an interim report to Bre-X , consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. said the company 's data on Busang was falsified on a scale without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world.It is a stunning conclusion to a mystery that has gripped the world mining community in recent months.Walsh , 51 , has made millions of dollars and appeared on the covers of national magazines since his Calgary , Alberta -based exploration company announced its 1993 Busang gold discovery in Indonesia.I 'm nuts .
I 'm looking for the bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow , the beefy stock promoter , who lives in the Bahamas , told a Canadian magazine earlier this year.Veteran Calgary journalist Jim Bentein , who covered Bre-X since its early days on the Alberta Stock Exchange , has described Walsh as a sophisticated trucker , who is as comfortable having a beer and a smoke in a bar as he is in financial circles.After the Strathcona report , some Bre-X shareholders who stood by the company during the turmoil now blamed Walsh.He should be prosecuted to full extent of the law , Chris Laughren , a construction worker , told Reuters on Sunday as he waited anxiously outside Bre-X 's headquarters in Calgary.Laughren said he has lost C $ 7,500 ( $ 5,400 ) on Bre-X stock , or three months work down the drain.Walsh said on Sunday he would do all he could to protect Bre-X 's assets for the benefit of the shareholders.Raised in a wealthy suburb of Montreal , Walsh followed his father and grandfather into the stock business.He joined a small trust company shortly after graduating from high school .
In 1976 he moved to brokerage Midland Doherty Ltd. ( now Midland Walwyn Capital Inc. ) and rose to vice president in its institutional equity sales department.In the 1980s Midland moved Walsh to Calgary , but he left the company shortly afterward to set up his own company , Bresea Resources Ltd.After dabbling unsuccessfully in oil and gas , Walsh created Bre-X Minerals Ltd. in 1989 and ventured into mining .
But by 1993 his exploration efforts had dried up.He and his wife declared bankruptcy in 1993 after accumulating almost C $ 60,000 ( $ 43,800 ) in debt on 15 credit cards.We had these claims which were worthless , and no money , Walsh said in an interview earlier this year.Almost broke , he scraped together C $ 10,000 ( $ 7,300 ) to start exploring in Indonesia , pursuading friends to invest C $ 200,000 ( $ 146,000 ) for a stake in the area now known as the central Busang in Indonesia 's East Kalamantan province.Walsh hit the jackpot with Busang , and Bre-X quickly became the darling of the world 's mining community.There 's nothing like success .
Our other explorations have been zero .
I had never imagined it would be this big , he said.Walsh , his wife and other company officials added more than C $ 37 million ( $ 27 million ) to their bank accounts after they sold Bre-X stock at prices ranging from C $ 24.40 ( $ 17.81 ) to C $ 28.40 ( $ 20.73 ) between August and October 1996.But the sales were controversial because they occurred shortly after Bre-X learned its preliminary license had been canceled by the Indonesian government , a development the company did not reveal publicly until October 1996.As the fallout from Sunday 's announcement reverberated through the world mining community , Walsh had little to say to reporters as he sped away from Bre-X 's Calgary headquarters.I think our press release says it all for now , he said .

Canadians were stunned on Sunday after a heartbreaking loss to the United States in the World Cup of Hockey dealt a crippling blow to the nation 's pride.Canada 's dream team -- a galaxy of National Hockey League stars including Wayne Gretzky , Mark Messier and Eric Lindros -- fell to an upstart American squad in a gripping finale to the World Cup championship on Saturday.Team USA , led by superb goaltending , defeated the Canadian squad 5-2 to win the best-of-three series in Montreal.Canadians -- who consider hockey more of a religion than a sport -- mourned the country 's worst loss in international play since 1981 when the Soviet Union handed Team Canada a crushing defeat in the Canada Cup -- the precursor to the World Cup.Saturday night 's loss has also rekindled fears of a further Americanisation of Canada 's sacred game.I feel terrible , just terrible .
That 's why I 'm here , Circiaco Deluca said as he quaffed a pint of beer in Wayne Gretzky 's bar in Toronto , surrounded by mementos of past Canadian hockey glory.Gretzky , known as the Great One , summed up the feelings of most of his countrymen after Saturday 's game.This is a crushed locker room right now and probably a crushed country .
It 's devastating , Gretzky told reporters.The disastrous outcome dominated the front pages of Canadian newspapers on Sunday.DAMN YANKEES , screamed the Montreal Gazette newspaper.AMERICA 'S GAME , cried the Toronto Star , Canada 's largest newspaper.The U.S. roared into Canada like a mayhem-minded mob of Hell 's Angels and left with a major chunk of our national heritage , wrote Star hockey columnist Damien Cox.The tabloid Toronto Sun featured a cartoon of the Statue of Liberty with a hockey stick in one hand and the World Cup trophy in another.Canada 's defeat comes at a time when many fans are lamenting the steady Americanisation of their game.Computer-enhanced pucks , flashy uniforms with cartoon characters , and the NHL 's expansion into non-traditional markets like Phoenix and Nashville have made hockey purists cringe.A Canadian-based team has not won the NHL 's championship Stanley Cup since 1993 and appears likely to extend the losing streak for another year.Small market clubs in Calgary , Edmonton and Ottawa are struggling to stay alive in the face of skyrocketing costs .
Quebec City and Winnipeg have already seen their franchises flee south to wealthier markets.Frank Diponzio , a tourist from Rochester , New York , said hockey 's future will depend on it growing in the bigger U.S. market.It 's not as popular as baseball or football , but it 's getting bigger .
Beating Canada at home will help , he said in an interview.Some Canadian fans were bitter that Canadian-born Brett Hull , the son of hockey legend Bobby Hull , scored twice in Saturday 's game -- for the United States.Hull , who has dual citizenship , played most of the game to chants of Brett Hull sucks from the partisan crowd in Montreal 's Molson Centre.I think he should have played for Canada .
It just shows a lack of respect for the country , said Trevor Murray , an 18-year-old student sporting a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater.But others said the younger , faster U.S. team deserved credit for a gritty performance.It 's not a national catastrophe .
They played a great game and we 'll be back , said Jack Porter of Sudbury , Ontario .
The fallout from the Busang gold controversy has tarnished Canada 's junior mining sector and wiil scare off many investors in 1997 , investment advisors said on Thursday.But they predicted a healthier industry will emerge in early 1998 after the Bre-X Minerals Ltd meltdown has faded into history.The Busang bust , no matter what the outcome of the Strathcona report , has killed this particular junior resource market cycle , John Kaiser , editor of a financial newsletter , told a Toronto mining investment conference on Thursday.If they have not already done so , fund managers will reduce their holdings of junior mining stocks in the wake of the Bre-X saga , said the editor of Kaiser 's Bottom-Fishing Report.The juniors will face a funding drought that will likely last through the rest of the year .
Retail investors will stick to the sidelines because they know this market cycle is over , he said.But Kaiser predicted the bull market will return in 1998.By early 1998 , the Canadian resource juniors will be ready to emerge from the bear market trough into which it is now sliding , he said.Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd is conducting an independent audit of Bre-X 's Busang project which was thrown into doubt last month.Bre-X has heralded Busang as the gold find of the century , but preliminary tests by its partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper & amp ; Gold Inc indicated the deposit may contain insignificant amounts of gold.The announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month , lopping almost C $ 3 billion , or more than 80 percent , from the company 's stock market value.Bre-X firmed C13 cents to close at C $ 2.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday.The Strathcona report is expected in early May.Other investment gurus at the conference said Busang has not dealt a fatal blow to Canada 's junior mining sector.I do n't give it ( the depressed market ) much more that 90 days or 120 days .
We 'll be back in business after that , predicted Brian Fagan , editor of the Asian World Stock Report , a newsletter focused on the mineral exploration sector.Last month 's Busang-driven selloff in Canadian junior mining stocks has served up some bargains for investors .
But they wo n't pay a high premium anymore.The companies are still good , but people are not willing to pay more for them , Fagan said.James Dines , the California-based editor of The Dines Letter , admonished Canadian investors for turning sour on the gold sector as a whole.The stampede to sell all gold stocks was just lemming like .
There is nothing wrong with your gold industry .
It will survive Bre-X , told the conference.Kaiser predicted a more sophisticated investor will emerge when the junior mining cycle turns upward again .
The Busang saga will also force analysts to take a more critical eye at junior mining companies and their projects.Dowm the road we will credit the Busang bust with launching a revolution in the way Canadian juniors get covered , Kaiser said .
The Busang rumor mill continued to churn on Wednesday as a jittery market weighed Freeport-McMoRan Copper & amp ; Gold Inc 's move to extend its review of the controversial gold project.Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd said on Wednesday that Freeport was granted an extension for its due diligence review of the Busang project until June 30.New Orleans-based Freeport , a partner in the Busang find , requested the extension to allow for consideration of the findings of the Strathcona audit , Bre-X said.Rumors have swirled around Busang since the century 's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partneb Freeport-McMoRan said its preliminary due diligence tests found insignificant amounts of gold.Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C $ 3 billion ( $ 2.1 billion ) or 80 percent from the company 's stock market value last month.Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd is expected to deliver a key report on Busang to Bre-X on Thursday or Friday .
Bre-X has said it will issue a press release on the report before North American financial markets open on Monday.Freeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday the request for the extension was made within the past week.The original agreement with Bre-X signed on February 26 said that FCX 's due diligence expire on April 30 .
This is really just to announce that we had pushed that date to June 30 to allow time for completion of the independent audit by Strathcona , Lemkau said in a telephone interview.Strathcona has said its final report to Bre-X would be delivered about six weeks after the interim report .
Strathcona has said the principal conclusions in the interim report are not expected to differ from the final report.Lemkau declined to comment when asked if Freeport planned any further drilling at Busang over the next two months.Bre-X shares led heavy traders on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday , closing down C32 ( US23 ) cents at C $ 3.48 ( $ 2.52 ) on 9.7 million shares.Some investors on an Internet chat page speculated on Wednesday that Freeport 's extension was favorable to Bre-X .
But mining analysts cautioned against reading too much into the announcement.I do n't think we should read into the request , although obviously investors are , said John Ing , president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.Everybody is reading a lot into the rumors .
But really they are just rumors right now , another Canadian mining analyst said.An Indonesian newspaper , citing unnamed sources , reported earlier this week that leaked results of Strathcona 's drill tests showed cheerful grades of gold.But in a report in the Calgary Sun newspaper on Wednesday , Strathcona President Graham Farquharson said it was unlikely that his company 's findings had been leaked.I still have n't seen the results myself -- the assays are still under way .
So I have to doubt the claim , Farquharson said in the Sun report.To the best of my knowledge there 've been no leaks , Farquharson said.Strathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada , Indonesia and Australia.Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory would have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished .
The Busang gold discovery in Indonesia -- touted by Canada 's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale without precedent in the history of mining according to a report released on Sunday.In a stunning report to Bre-X , consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. said it found evidence of tampering with Bre-X core samples taken from the Busang site , located deep in the jungles of Borneo.The magnitude of the tampering with core samples that we believe has occurred and resulting falsification of assay values at Busang , is of a scale and over a period of time and with a precision that , to our knowledge , is without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world , the report said.Strathcona said it did not find an economic gold deposit in the southeast zone of the Busang property , the area claimed by Bre-X to contain about 71 million ounces of gold .
The report said an economic deposit was unlikely.The Toronto Stock Exchange said on Sunday that it would halt trading in Bre-X shares on Monday in light of the extremely negative report from Strathcona.Bre-X 's stock closed up 19 cents ( 14 cents ) at C $ 3.23 ( $ 2.34 ) on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday.Bre-X chairman David Walsh , the maverick mining executive who gambled his last C $ 10,000 ( $ 7,200 ) on finding Busang , said the company was devastated by Strathcona 's findings.We share the shock and dismay of our shareholders and others that the gold we thought we had at Busang now appears not to be there , Walsh said in a statement on Sunday.As the fallout from Sunday 's announcement reverberated through the world mining community , Walsh had little to say to reporters as he sped away from Bre-X 's Calgary headquarters where shareholders and reporters had gathered.I think our press release says it all for now , he said.The report spells the end of Bre-X , said gold analyst John Ing of Maison Placements Canada in Toronto.Bre-X has got nothing , that 's what it means , Ing said in a telephone interview .
They 've got nothing but lawsuits on their hands , he said.With billions of dollars in limbo , nervous shareholders have traded rumors for weeks on Internet chat sites while they waited for the Strathcona report.Some Bre-X shareholders who stood by the company during the recent turmoil now lay the blame at Walsh 's feet.He should be prosecuted to full extent of the law , Chris Laughren , a construction worker , told Reuters on Sunday as he waited outside Bre-X 's headquarters.Laughren said he has lost C $ 7,500 ( $ 5,400 ) on Bre-X stock , or three months work down the drain.Walsh said in a statement on Sunday he would do all he could to protect Bre-X 's remaining assets for the benefit of the shareholders.A penny-stock exploration firm before it discovered Busang in 1993 , Bre-X quickly became the darling of the Toronto Stock Exchange amid glowing reports of Busang 's potential.But rumors began swirling around Bre-X and its Busang deposit after the March 19 apparent suicide of Bre-X 's top geologist in Indonesia.Michael de Guzman allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter while en route to a meeting with officials at Freeport-McMoRan Copper & amp ; Gold Inc , one of Bre-X 's partners in the Busang project.A week later on March 26 , New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan said that its preliminary tests found insignificant amounts of gold.The reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Bre-X 's head of exploration John Felderhof and his team of geologists , including de Guzman .
The last estimate of 71 million ounces of gold was calculated by assay firm Kilborn SNC Lavalin , a unit of Montreal-based SNC Lavalin Inc. Kilborn has already said it was not responsible for sampling.After the Freeport-McMoRan report Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona , a well-respected Canadian mining consulting firm , to review its Busang project.The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares , wiping almost C $ 3 billion ( $ 2.1 billion U.S. ) from the company 's market value when the stock plummeted to C $ 2.50 ( $ 1.80 ) from around C $ 15 ( $ 11 ) .A Freeport spokesman said on Sunday the company had no immediate comment , but would release a statement before North American financial markets opened on Monday.Our response is we 're aware Bre-X has released a news release , spokesman Garland Robinette said.Freeport said last month it would elect to participate in the Busang project only if development is , in ( Freeport 's ) opinion , economically feasible.Disgruntled shareholders have already launched at least eight class action lawsuits.The Ontario Securities Commission , Canada 's top securities regulator , is investigating Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws.Increasing attention is being paid to personal trades by Walsh , his wife and other company officials in 1996 , which netted them about C $ 77 million ( $ 55 million ) .Less than a year ago , Bre-X was the target of an intense bidding war as several heavyweight mining firms battled for control of possibly the world 's richest gold discovery .

A monster shakeup of Canada 's biggest city , Toronto , has sparked a citizens ' revolt against Ontario 's ruling Conservatives and raised eyebrows among those who do business in the country 's financial capital.This clean , peaceful city -- sometimes dubbed New York run by the Swiss -- has recently become a battleground in the so-called Common Sense Revolution initiated by Ontario 's Conservative Premier Mike Harris.Promising leaner , cheaper government , Harris wants to merge Toronto and six neighbouring municipalities into a single megacity of 2.4 million people .
The new city would hold about 8 percent of Canada 's 30 million people and dwarf all but three of Canada 's 10 provinces.Harris also plans a fundamental shift in how public services -- everything from education to welfare -- are delivered and paid for.Opponents fear the municipal reform blitz will drive up taxes and lead to the kind of urban decay witnessed in many cities in the United States , just across the border.The threat of such wrenching change being rammed through without a binding plebiscite has outraged citizens and prompted accusations of tyranny and fascism.Government is not elected for the politicians .
It is elected by the people for the people , Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall told a crowd after residents in the seven affected areas voted three to one against a merger in a referendum earlier this month .
The vote was not binding on Ontario 's government , which has vowed to press ahead with its plan.The referendum capped a campaign that saw an Ontario cabinet minister likened to Adolf Hitler , bomb threats against a polling firm , and thousands of protesters marching in the streets in a re-enactment of a civic rebellion in 1837.Harris has held firm .
I do n't think we can withdraw the need for change , he said , adding that there may be amendments when the legislation is introduced.The megacity revolt has grabbed headlines across the country and overseas , even prompting some foreign consulates to keep a wary eye on the political wrangling.There is some interest , but it 's purely because it has appeared in the ( British ) papers , said Terry Curran , the British Consul in Toronto.Meanwhile , high-profile Canadian business leaders , politicians and artists have joined to oppose the merger plan.They include film director Norman Jewison , Molson Cos. Ltd Chief Executive Norman Seagram , and writer Margaret Atwood who compared the megacity 's architects to the Three Stooges.The No side captured 75 percent of the votes in the referendum , but the process was flawed and turnout was low.Under draft legislation , known as Bill 103 , the seven city halls and 106 politicians who now govern the Greater Toronto Area will shrink to one elected mayor and 44 councillors.The government also plans to overhaul property taxes , eliminate more than half of the province 's school boards , seize control of education funding and download a bigger share of social programme costs onto the municipalities.Harris has said the reforms are revenue neutral , but critics say municipalities may be forced to raise taxes.They fear welfare rolls could soar and one of the hardest hit communities would be Toronto , which has a heavier welfare caseload and nearly half of the province 's social housing.You 're doing something that is very volatile and on a tax base which has very little flexibility , said George Fierheller , president of Toronto 's Board of Trade.More than 75 percent of the board 's members favour reducing the size of government through a merger but nearly half worry about dumping such heavy responsibilities onto municipalities.As a Torontonian and a businessman responsible for a large company , I 'm wary of abrupt change without making sure you 've thought it through , said Peter Godsoe , chairman of Canada 's fourth-largest bank , Bank of Nova Scotia.The influential debt rating agency , Moody 's Investors Service , has warned the very nature and scale of the reforms ... create new challenges that could affect the credit quality of some municipalities.The downloading trend has been a feature of government at all levels in Canada as they struggle with budget deficits.Ontario is in a tougher bind than most .
Faced with a huge C $ 10 ( $ 7.38 ) billion deficit when they came to power in 1995 , the Conservatives slashed spending and cut the deficit to C $ 7.7 billion in 1996/97 , while easing some taxes.The Harris revolution has kept the government high in opinion polls , but public support has slipped recently , with backing for the Conservatives down to 37 percent in Metro Toronto , compared with 41 percent for the opposition Liberals .
Warm weather spurred sales of spring merchandise and boosted retail sales in February , the nation 's store chains said Thursday , but flooding in the Midwest could hurt results in March.Industry officials and analysts said most winter clothing was cleared out of stores in January and early February , so retailers were properly stocked for spring.Salomon Bros. said its index of same-store sales rose 4.7 percent in February , compared to a 5.2 percent rise a year ago and a 7.3 percent January rise .
Same-store sales measure results at stores open at least a year.It looks like early trends on spring fashion are good , said Harry Ikenson , analyst at Rodman & amp ; Renshaw Inc .
Inventories seem to be in good shape and it 's a good start to spring.After January 's sales performance , our level of clearance merchandise coming into February was substantially below last year , said William Kellogg , chairman of Kohl 's Corp. , a Wisconsin-based retailer with 150 stores in the Midwest and the East.We are particularly encouraged by the early selling of spring merchandise.Though comparisons were difficult after retailers posted a strong February in 1996 , a week of temperatures in the 50s and 60s in much of the country this year was a plus.It drives people in to buy spring merchandise , analyst Peter Schaeffer at Dillon Read & amp ; Co. said.Several chains posted stronger-than-expected results.Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the nation 's larget retailer , said same-store sales rose 6.7 percent , above analysts ' forecasts , while J.C. Penney Co. Inc. posted a strong 11.4 percent gain.Kmart Corp. , the third-biggest retailer , said sales rose 3.9 percent at comparable stores , while Sears , Roebuck and Co. , the No .
2 retailer , posted a 1.6 percent gain.Among department stores , Dayton Hudson Corp. said sales rose 4.2 percent , Federated Department Stores Inc. reported a 2.2 percent gain and Dillard Department Stores Inc. had a 1 percent rise.Carson Pirie Scott & amp ; Co. reported on Monday that February sales rose a solid 8.2 percent.I was particularly pleased with the strong initial sell-through on new spring receipts during the month , Carson Chief Executive Stanton Bluestone said in a statement.Sales at clothing chain The Gap Inc. were flat.Sales of computers and other electronic gear continued to lag , though results were not as weak as had been expected.Electronics superstores Best Buy Co. Inc. and Circuit City Stores said sales fell 3 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
Analysts had expected sales declines of up to 10 percent.Sales of electronic gear , which have been dismal for several months , were unlikely to improve until later this year or early 1998 when new high-tech products are due to be available , analysts said.They also said retail stocks were unlikely to be as strong as they were in 1996.I do n't think that we 're seeing any sort of a rally here in retail like we saw last year , Dillon Read 's Schaeffer said .
I do n't think it 's a sector play , it 's an individual stock play.Gap shares fell $ 1.25 to $ 32.50 , Dillard fell 25 cents to $ 30.25 , Sears lost 75 cents to $ 54.875 , and Federated was unchanged at $ 35.875.Best Buy rose $ 1.375 to $ 10 , Circuit City added $ 2 to $ 33.75 , Wal-Mart rose 12.5 cents to $ 26.75 and J.C. Penney gained 37.5 cents to $ 49.50 .
First Bank System Inc is seen paying a premium price to expand its geographic footprint to the Pacific Northwest with its planned $ 9 billion acquisition of Portland , Oregon-based U.S. Bancorp.This is very rich pricing , analyst James Schutz at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp said , noting that the deal -- which would make First Bank the 14th largest bank in the United States based on assets -- values U.S. Bancorp at about $ 59.08 a share , or 19.2 times 1996 earnings .
U.S. Bancorp shares were up 6-3/16 at 54-7/16 Thursday.But at the same time , First Bank chief executive John Grundhofer 's reputation for aggressive cost cutting , the complementary fit of U.S. Bancorp with Minneapolis-based First Bank 's mostly Midwestern markets , and the rich price of bank stocks in general , make the deal palatable to analysts.It 's a natural fit for them , said Frank Barkocy , analyst at Josephthal , Lyon & amp ; Ross .
It 's a natural extension of their marketplace .
First Bank said it would be able to grow revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp 's extensive corporate base .
Home equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp 's customers , while U.S. Bancorp 's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers , the banks said.Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines , said Stephen Biggar , analyst at S & amp ; P Equity Group .
First Bank expects to cut the combined banks ' operating expenses by about 14 percent , with a pre-tax cost savings of about $ 340 million.We believe that ( First Bank 's ) ability to cut costs could make this deal work , Salomon Brothers said in a note on the deal , according to market sources.While First Bank stock was down 3-1/2 at 74-3/4 Thursday , analysts still saw the deal as a positive for the acquisition minded bank.They 've got the acqusition history behind them , Biggar said .
They 've got a management that can make deals work .
The deal could also spark more bank consolidation , especially in the Midwest , with buyers swooping in while First Bank is busy consolidating its purchase , analysts said.We expect this announcement could trigger other activity , Salomon Brothers said , according to market sources.Among potential targets frequently mentioned are Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp and Cleveland-based KeyCorp .
Schutz even argues that Chicago-based First Chicago NBD Corp could be an attractive target at a reasonable price.For bang for the buck , First Chicago is probably the most lucrative in terms of Midwest markets , he said .
( ( Chicago newsdesk , 312-408-8787 ) ) USG Corp , maker of building products such as wallboard , is looking to double its earnings by the early 2000s from its 1995 base.By the early 2000s , we would like to double the bottomline of our company , USG chief executive William Foote said in an interview.He said that goal was based on its 1995 earnings .
The company reported earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization of $ 417 million in 1995.EBITDA rose to $ 437 million in 1996 for the company.USG plans to achieve this by growing revenues with production expansion and through cost cutting initiatives , Foote said.The company is also seeking to have its debt rating raised to investment grade -- triple-B or better -- by the end of 1998 , Foote said .
The rating is currently double-B-plus.The company currently spends about $ 150 million a year on capital improvements and $ 150 million a year to pay down debt .
Once investment grade rating is reached , more of the company 's cash will be spent on expanding capacity and improving costs , Foote said.On Thursday , USG said its United States Gypsum Co unit will spend at least $ 85 million to build a facility to manufacture gypsum wood fiber panels , a building product the company plans to position between its less expensive wallboard product and more expensive cement board.In November , the company announced plans to build a new , lower-cost wallboard manufacturing facility in Bridgeport , Ala. for $ 110 million .
The company also last year said it would spend $ 35 million to modernize a Cloquet , Minn. plant.Foote would not rule out announcing another new facility plan by the end of 1997.There are no plans that are imminent but I ca n't say that that might not happen , Foote said.He also conceded that the new gypsum wood fiber product could cannabalize sales of the company 's other products , but noted that this would free USG up to sell to more customers in the wallboard market.It would allow us to increase our ( wallboard ) market share , Foote said .
We are able to sell all the Sheetrock ( wallboard ) we make right now.USG shares closed up 1/2 at 32-3/4 Thursday .
( ( Chicago newsdesk , 312-408-8787 ) ) Shuffle Master Inc Chief Executive Joseph Lahti said Monday he is not seeking to put the gaming equipment supplier up for sale , but also said it was his responsibility to consider ways that provide value to shareholders.Are we in play ?
No , Lahti said in an interview .
But he added that if someone were to inquire about the availability of the company , what 's the price is my next question.Shuffle Master earlier said it would not pursue unsolicited discussions with Anchor Gaming .
Those discussions , initiated by Anchor Chairman Stanley Fulton , related to a potential business combination with Anchor , Shuffle Master said in a news release.Shuffle Master also said it believes it will be served with a lawsuit by Anchor alleging that Shuffle Master 's Let It Ride game infringes on certain of Anchor 's patents.Lahti said in a news release that Shuffle Master viewed any potential lawsuit as an attempt by Las Vegas-based Anchor to pressure Eden Prairie , Minnesota-based Shuffle Master into a business combination .
In the interview , Lahti said Shuffle Master noted Anchor 's game when it filed for its patent , yet was awarded a patent anyway.Anchor did not return telephone calls seeking comment.But one analyst was skeptical of whether Anchor would seek to acquire Shuffle Master , which is trading at about 24 times its annualized third quarter earnings of $ 0.13 a share.I find Anchor being interested highly unlikely , said Stuart Linde , analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison & amp ; Co , who rates Shuffle Master a sell .
I think Anchor 's more intent on making an acquisition in the casino sector .
He said an acquisition of Shuffle Master at current prices would be dilutive for Anchor.Shuffle Master shares fell 1/8 to 11-5/8 Monday , while Anchor 's stock price fell 5/8 to 52-3/4 , both on Nasdaq.Another analyst said Shuffle Master could be part of consolidation in the gaming equipment business.Consolidation on the supply side really has n't occurred yet , said Robert Evans , analyst at John G. Kinnard & amp ; Co .
It would n't be surprising if it did. -- Reuters Chicago newsdesk , 312-408-8787 Sears , Roebuck and Co will spend more than $ 500 million to revamp and expand its off-the-mall tire and battery stores under the new National Tire and Battery name , the retailer said Wednesday.The change is part of a plan under which Sears will spend more than $ 1 billion through the year 2002 on its entire auto group to add stores and convert some existing stores .
Hoffman Estates , Ill.-based Sears , which sold 25 million tires and 8.5 million batteries through its Sears Tire Group in 1996 , will combine most of its 275 Tire America and National Tire Warehouse Stores under the National Tire and Battery name , Sears said.The company also plans to add about 100 National Tire stores over the next five years , hoping to add about $ 120 million in annual revenue for the tire group when the expansion is completed .
Sears ' tire group had $ 2.3 billion in revenues in 1996 .
The stores , unveiled Wednesday in Chicago , will have a high-tech , open feel , with customers able to watch the work being done on their cars .
Pricing will be competitive in individual markets , Sears said.We will be at market pricing in every market we 're in , Paul Baffico , president of Sears Automotive Group , said in an interview .
We do not necessarily want to be the market price leader , but we will be competitive with anybody who is in the market .
The off-the-mall stores are geared toward a younger , higher income customer with higher performance car needs than the 800 mall-based Sears Auto Centers , Baffico said .
Because of the existence of the mall stores , the retailer chose not to include the Sears name in National Tire and Battery.From a location strategy standpoint , a different name allows us to be closer to a Sears store without cannibalizing the market , Baffico said.Areas targeted for new tire stores this year are Detroit , Minneapolis/St .
Paul , Rochester , N.Y. and Buffalo , N.Y. Sears will also add a small number of Sears Auto Center stores in malls where they have recently acquired other retailers , Baffico said.Separately , Sears plans to spend more than $ 650 million to add 780 Parts America auto parts stores by the year 2002 and to transform 240 Western Auto stores to Parts America , Baffico said .
We should be by 2002 the clear number two in parts , Baffico said .
That category is currently led by Memphis , Tenn.-based AutoZone Inc , with Pep Boys -- Manny , Moe & amp ; Jack of Philadelphia second , based on revenues .
Sears ' parts group had $ 1.4 billion in revenue in 1996.Since the parts stores do not compete with Sears ' mall format , the company will decide by the end of the summer whether to include the Sears name in the name of the stores , Baffico said.One analyst agreed that Sears ' expansion plans for the automotive group were aggressive , but noted that the company was being even more aggressive in other formats.Those are relatively aggressive , but remember they 're coming from a place where they 've been a little stagnant for a while , Stephen Latz , analyst at A.G. Edwards , said of the auto group expansion plans .
( ( Chicago newsdesk , 312-408-8787 ) ) TCF Financial Corp. and Standard Financial Inc. said Monday they signed a definitive agreement for TCF to acquire Standard Financial for $ 424 million in stock and cash.The deal was announced two days after Milwaukee-based bank holding company Marshall & amp ; Ilsley Corp. said it would acquire cross-town thrift Security Capital Corp. for about $ 945 million in cash and stock , or about $ 92 a share.Both deals help the buyer increase market share in the consolidating Midwest banking arena .
Marshall & amp ; Ilsley said it will increase its market share to 19.2 percent in Wisconsin , with Milwaukee-based Firstar Corp. , the number two bank in the state , at 12.1 percent of deposits.At the same time , the acquisition of $ 2.4 billion asset Standard Financial and its 14 full-service offices would strengthen TCF 's franchise in Chicago , allowing it to do more cost affective advertising than it could before the deal , William Cooper , chairman of $ 7.1 billion asset TCF said.We believe this merger will produce long-term revenue enhancements and meaningful cost savings , Cooper said in a news release.TCF expects to save about $ 4 million annually once the two banks ' operations are combined in Illinois and to generate more than $ 4 million in revenues from the deal by offering more products to Standard Financial customers , changing the mix of Standard Financial 's loan portfolio to add higher yielding loans and through fees at its automatic teller machines.Standard certainly has the customer profile TCF looks for , but I thought the price that they paid was fairly rich based on Standard 's earnings , Stephen Skiba , analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp , said.The combined company would have $ 10 billion in assets and 276 financial services offices and more than 900 automatic teller machines in five Midwest states.TCF , a savings bank holding company based in Minneapolis , will offer about $ 25 for each Standard share .
Standard stockholders may choose to receive cash or TCF shares or a combination of the two .
Between 40 percent and 60 percent of the purchase would be paid in TCF stock , and the rest in cash.The exchange ratio for shares would depend on the average price of TCF stock during the 30 trading days before the deal closes.Analysts also thought Marshall & amp ; Ilsley paid a full price for Security Capital , a $ 3.66 billion asset thrift with 42 bank branches and 10 lending offices throughout Wisconsin.The $ 92 a share acquisition price includes about 12.3 million Marshall & amp ; Ilsley common shares and $ 376 million in cash and is a premium over the $ 84.75 closing price for Security Capital Friday.It 's pretty pricey , said Thomas Maier , analyst at EVEREN Securities .
You can argue that given what it does for them in terms of share in the state of Wisconsin , it 's worth it.Wisconsin is seen as one target area for Midwest regional banks to make acqusitions to enhance market share.I think it 's a defensive move on M & amp ; I 's part , that if they did n't grow within the Wisconsin market , it was more likely they would be a takeover target , Skiba said.Skiba also said the acquisition of Standard Financial by TCF could make other Chicago-area thrifts , including MAF Bancorp Inc. and St. Paul Bancorp Inc. , even more likely acquisition targets.I think there 's becoming a scarcity value on the large independent thrift franchises that are left , Skiba said.TCF shares fell $ 0.625 to $ 44 Monday , Standard Financial rose $ 2.375 to $ 23.50 , Marshall & amp ; Ilsley fell $ 0.56 to $ 36.75 , and Security Capital rose $ 0.75 to $ 85.50 .
First Bank System Inc. said Thursday it will acquire U.S. Bancorp in an $ 8.5 billion stock deal that will make it the 14th-largest bank in the United States and give it a firm toehold in the Pacific Northwest.The deal between Minneapolis-based First Bank and U.S. Bancorp , a regional bank based in Portland , Ore. , will also result in the loss of about 4,000 jobs , the banks said.Under a definitive agreement , U.S. Bancorp shareholders will receive , in a tax-free exchange , 0.755 share of First Bank common stock for each U.S. Bancorp share they own.Based on First Bank 's trading price of $ 74.875 Thursday , which was down $ 3.375 , the purchase price equals $ 56.53 a share for holders of U.S. Bancorp , whose shares jumped $ 6.50 to $ 54.75.This is very rich pricing , analyst James Schutz at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. said , noting that the deal values U.S. Bancorp at about 19.2 times its 1996 earnings.However , First Bank Chief Executive John Grundhofer 's reputation for aggressive cost cutting , the complementary fit of U.S. Bancorp with First Bank 's mostly Midwestern markets and the rich price of bank stocks in general made the deal palatable to many analysts.You could live a couple of lifetimes without finding another fit this good , Grundhofer said in a statement announcing the deal.It 's a natural fit for them , said Frank Barkocy , analyst at Josephthal , Lyon & amp ; Ross .
It 's a natural extension of their marketplace.First Bank said it expected pretax cost savings of about $ 340 million from the merger , with combined operating expenses being reduced by 14 percent.First Bank said it would take pretax charges of $ 625 million for costs related to the merger , which was expected to close by the end of June.It also said the deal was expected to add to its earnings per share starting in the second quarter of next year .
By 1999 , First Bank sees about an 8 percent addition to earnings per share.First Bank said it would be able to increase revenues from the deal by offering its payment systems services to U.S. Bancorp 's extensive corporate base.Home equity lending and investment management services are also businesses First Bank plans to offer U.S. Bancorp 's customers , while U.S. Bancorp 's leasing expertise would be offered to First Bank customers , the banks said.Where the deal makes more sense is the compatibility of the business lines , said Stephen Biggar , analyst at S & amp ; P Equity Group.Grundhofer will be president and chief executive of the new company , which will take the U.S. Bancorp name but remain based in Minneapolis.U.S .
Bancorp Chairman Gerry Cameron will serve as chairman of the merged bank until his retirement in 1998.Since 1991 , First Bank has made 23 acquisitions , including the $ 717 million acquisition of Nebraska-based FirsTier Financial Inc. in 1996 .
Harnischfeger Industries Inc 's $ 19 a share tender offer for industrial tool and systems maker Giddings & amp ; Lewis Inc could be about the best offer Giddings can get , industry analysts said Monday.I do n't think there 's much more in that Harnischfeger bid than what 's in there , and I do n't think there 's anyone else out there that would make a higher bid , Thomas Burns Jr. , analyst at NatWest Securities , said .
Shares of Fond du Lac , Wisconsin-based Giddings & amp ; Lewis jumped 6-3/4 to 20-3/8 Monday .
That was seen as an indication that some buyers expect a higher bid , a view many analysts take issue with.My feeling is at $ 19 a share , that 's full value , I think , for Giddings & amp ; Lewis , said William Cooke , analyst at McDonald & amp ; Co .
I think that Harnischfeger is assuming they can double the earnings of Giddings & amp ; Lewis in the not too distant future .
I think they 're being optimistic .
Harnischfeger said it is looking at using Giddings & amp ; Lewis to expand in the fragmented industrial products aftermarket service business , which Harnischfeger estimates as an $ 80 billion market.But some analysts said buying Giddings & amp ; Lewis , a company that took a $ 64.1 million charge last year to try to fix its integrated automation systems business , adds a lot of uncertainty for Harnischfeger shareholders .
... we believe that investors will be looking at a fundamentally different company with much more risk involved than they had previously , J. Blair Brumley , analyst at Dain Bosworth , wrote in a research note , in which he also lowered the rating of Harnischfeger to a hold from a buy.While saying the Harnischfeger bid was not a done deal , we expect ( Harnischfeger ) to pursue its target with vigor and would be suprised if another offer significantly higher than the one now on the table would surface , Brumley said .
Some analysts said Harnischfeger has picked a perfect time to go after Giddings & amp ; Lewis .
Giddings has already taken steps to fix its underperforming operations , but the stock , in their opinion , still is ailing , they said.They got all the dirty work behind them , said Darren Bagwell , analyst at Robert W. Baird & amp ; Co Inc .
They 've wiped the slate clean , and yet the stock price still reflects that wait and see attitude.In fact , Bagwell also said Giddings & amp ; Lewis could probably squeeze a higher bid out of somebody and said he felt the company was worth more than $ 19 a share.Some analysts also noted that Harnischfeger 's bid was likely based only on publicly available information and that a bidder who had a good look at Giddings & amp ; Lewis books might find information to convince them to make a higher offer.Harnischfeger shares were down 3-5/8 at 41-3/4 Monday .
( ( Chicago newsdesk , 312-408-8787 ) ) Banyan Strategic Realty Trust , which releases its full 1996 results early next week , will report funds from operations ( FFO ) of $ 0.03 a share for the 1996 fourth quarter , down from $ 0.07 a share a year ago.Leonard Levine , chief executive of the real estate investment trust also said Friday that funds from operations for the year ended December 31 would be $ 0.34 a share , up from $ 0.32 a share a year ago.But the company expects funds from operations , the standard measure of a REITs performance , to jump in 1997 .
In 1997 , we expect our targeted numbers for FFO , both as a result of acquisitions made in late '96 and continuing acquisitions in early '97 ... will be somewhere between $ 0.50 and $ 0.55 , Levine said in an interview.The company 's target for 1998 FFO is $ 0.65 to $ 0.70 a share , not including additional acquisitions , which it expects to make.By June 30 of this year , Banyan expects to own 19 properties in the Midwest and Southeast , including industrial buildings , suburban office buildings , apartment complexes and a retail center .
Real estate is cyclical and the best way to protect against that cycle is to spread your risk , Levine said in explaining Banyan 's strategy , which is counter to most REITs , which focus on one property sector.The company focuses on markets without much competition from larger REITs .
Our principal investment strategy is to focus on smaller real estate markets and smaller properties where we believe there continues to be extraordinary opportunities available to us to purchase stable and appreciating real estate and where the economies are both very strong and there continues to be an absence of credit and capital , Levine said.Banyan buys properties with an eye toward both improving its revenue stream and selling at a profit down the road.The company hopes to speed its portfolio growth in coming years and Levine expects Banyan to make some sort of equity offering in the next year to raise market capital.I think sometime within the next 12 months we 'll be exploring ways in which the company can grow from that perspective , Levine said of a potential equity offering.Among the benefits from an equity offering would be to improve Banyan 's liquidity , he added.Shares of the company closed Wednesday at four and have not traded since .
( ( Chicago newsdesk , 312-408-8787 ) ) Talks between Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workers will resume with the help of a federal mediator , the parties said Friday , almost a year and a half after striking workers returned to the work at the heavy machinery maker.No date has been set for the talks called by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service .
The talks would be the first formal negotiations since November 1995 , when a tentative agreement , subsequently rejected , was submitted to UAW members.The 17-month strike ended in December 1995 without a new contract .
Peoria , Illinois-based Caterpillar 's workers have been without a contract since 1991.Neither Caterpillar nor the union would say if any specific event occurred to spur new talks.As a result of conversations between FMCS , UAW and Caterpillar , I have called a meeting of the parties for a discussion of the issues between them , John Calhoun Wells , FMCS director , said in a statement.A union official said jobs and job security have been main issues throughout negotiations , while almost 400 unfair labour practice complaints by the UAW and seniority problems have also become issues.I 've always felt that there 's going to come a time when it would make a good business decision for the company to reach a labour agreement , Jim Clingan , executive vice president of UAW local 974 in Peoria , said .
But he added that he did not know if that time has been reached.Caterpillar has reported record profits in the wake of the strike and analysts have said the continuing labour woes have had little , if any , impact on the company 's bottom line .
( Caterpillar is ) not going to budge enough for it to make a difference , said J. Blair Brumley , analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc .
Even if they get a contract , it 's not going to look very different than what those guys are working under now.Caterpillar reported profit of $ 1.4 billion on revenues of $ 16.52 billion in 1996.In a statement , Cateprillar vice president Wayne Zimmerman called the resumption of meetings a positive development.It 's long past time to resolve the uncertainty this dispute has created for our employees , Zimmerman said.UAW president Stephen Yokich also welcomed Wells ' announcement.It is clearly in the best interests of all stakeholders , including communities and families , that the long-standing labour dispute be resolved equitably , Yockich said in a statement.Caterpillar shares rose $ 2.625 to $ 93.375 in line with other capital equipment makers.Brumley noted that when the news of the announcement was made , Caterpillar shares traded lower briefly .
Microsoft Corp. stock surged 10 percent to a record close Friday , a day after the software giant reported an 85 percent increase in quarterly earnings , smashing Wall Street estimates.Microsoft jumped $ 9.50 to $ 107.625 on Nasdaq and was by far the most active issue with nearly 29 million shares changing hands.While Microsoft keeps expectations low and then routinely surpasses them , analysts were stunned by the results reported late Thursday from the latest quarter , which included earnings that were 23 percent higher than estimates.I think it 's the best quarter I 've ever seen , said Scott McAdams , who has watched the company for years as an analayst at Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle .
I was floored.As they always do , Microsoft executives warned they could not sustain the current pace , and analysts agreed growth will slow over the next five quarters , particularly when the company faces comparisons with the period that just ended.But coupled with better-than-expected earnings from its hardware ally Intel Corp. , Microsoft 's results reflect fundamental strength in the personal computer industry , analysts said.The combination of very strong returns from Microsoft and very strong returns from Intel certainly indicates we 're still in an upswing , and I dont believe we 've hit the maximum level , said Rob Enderle , senior analyst with Giga Information Group.He and other analysts said the strong sales were being driven by a shift to 32-bit operating systems and applications led by Microsoft 's Windows 95 operating system and its Office 97 desktop programmes.While Windows 95 has been on the market for 20 months , the original uptake was not that dramatic , particularly among corporate users , said Drew Brosseau of Cowen & amp ; Co.He said only 20 percent of large organisations had moved to a 32-bit desktop from the older 16-bit DOS and Windows operating systems by the end of 1996.But last year 's release of Microsoft 's Windows NT version 4.0 cleared a logjam and triggered the current sales surge by allowing corporate managers to make an informed choice between Microsoft 's two main operating systems , Brosseau said.It 's pretty clear that momentum is going to continue through the end of the year , Brosseau said.Meanwhile , Microsoft has another ace up its sleeve in its line of server software for corporate networks , led by the Windows NT Server operating system and the BackOffice group of applications.Analyst Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs estimated sales of Microsoft 's business systems would rise to $ 1.5 billion this year from $ 750 million last year.Sherlund was among many analysts who raised Microsoft earnings estimates for the current quarter and fiscal 1998 , which begins July 1.First Call , which tracks earnings estimates , said 17 analysts raised estimates to an average of $ 3.10 a share for fiscal 1998 , compared with a previous consensus of $ 2.72 .
For the current fiscal year , which ends June 30 , the analysts raised estimates to an average $ 2.62 , up from a previous consensus of $ 2.34.For its fiscal third quarter ending March 31 , Microsoft reported earnings of $ 1.04 billion or 79 cents a share , compared with $ 562 million or 44 cents a share a year earlier .
Analysts on average expected earnings of 64 cents a share.Revenue for the quarter rose to $ 3.21 billion from $ 2.21 billion , smashing estimates the company would bring in $ 2.9 billion in revenues .
Microsoft Corp. Monday plans to announce a version of its Windows 95 operating system for hand-held consumer devices that will be available this year , according to sources familiar with the company 's plans.The Windows CE system for consumer electronics comes two years after Microsoft scuttled a similar project known as Winpad because its intensive memory requirements would have made the hardware too costly.Since then the explosive growth of the Internet has expanded the market possibilities for small wireless devices , while Microsoft rival Oracle Corp. has popularised the concept of a $ 500 consumer device for accessing the Internet.Microsoft officials declined to comment , but the company said it would have an announcement early Monday on a significant addition in the area of Microsoft Windows platform software.Microsoft executives previously had disclosed plans to supply a system for hand-held devices in time for the holiday season.The devices , ranging from a smart wireless telephone to personal organisers with communcations capabilities , will be marketed by eight computer and consumer electronics companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. , Casio Computer Co. Ltd. , and Philips Electronics NV , industry analysts said.The operating system will include stripped-down versions of Microsoft 's Word and Excel applications and are likely to have some ability to get information off the Internet 's World Wide Web.But with their tiny , monochrome screens , analysts believe they will be used at first largely for accessing electronic mail and personal information such as telephone numbers and appointments.The Web does n't look good on a 4-inch screen , said analyst Mike McGuire of Dataquest .
What this is about is Internet transactions and communications.While hand-held personal digital assistants such as Apple Computer Inc. 's Newton have been available for several years the products have failed to grow beyond a niche category in part because of the difficulty of swapping information between them and desktop computers , analysts say.Microsoft aims to break that logjam with its new system , built for RISC microprocessors from Hitachi and others rather than the Intel Corp. processors used for most Windows-based computers.But at $ 500 -- or close to $ 1,000 for a machine fully loaded with communications accessories -- price will continue to be an obstacle , said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group , who said the sweet spot for small devices was about $ 300.I do n't really think the market is going to really jump off in big number until next year , he said.McGuire of Dataquest estimated worldwide shipments of hand-held devices would rise to at least 5 million units a year by the end of the decade from the current 1 million.While that 's still relatively small compared with a personal computer market of about 60 million units annually , Microsoft needs to protect its Windows franchise from any potential incursion , said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.If you let someone else get that operating system , over time someone could start working that system upmarket , he said .
Microsoft needs to be a player here.Microsoft move into hand-held systems could pose a threat to U.S. Robotics Corp. and Britain 's Psion Software Plc , two of the most successful marketers of proprietary hand-held products.The Windows CE system also could be licensed for use with a rival to Oracle 's Network Computer , analysts said .
Microsoft Corp , target of a long-running series of federal antitrust investigations , has been asked to provide documents for a new Texas state probe of the Internet market , officials said Tuesday.Mark Murray , a spokesman for the computer software giant , said Microsoft received a civil investigative demand Monday from the Texas attorney general 's office , and company lawyers expect to cooperate with state officials.Texas officials are investigating the possibility of monopolization and other conduct in restraint of trade in the market for Internet software in violation of state antitrust laws , assistant attorney general Mark Tobey said in a letter to Microsoft.Among the documents requested in the wide-ranging demand were licensing agreements , strategic plans , budgets and financial projections and all documents related to competition in the market for Internet or Intranet software.We 've just received this letter , Murray said .
We 're in the process of reviewing it , and we 'll be working closely with them to identify the documents that they 're looking for and provide them.Microsoft 's Internet software rival Netscape Communications Corp. received a similar demand more than a month ago and complied with it , said Gary Reback , attorney for the Mountain View , California , company and a prominent critic of Microsoft 's business practices.I do n't think Netscape was the target of the investigation , said Reback .
It was pretty clear that they 're not the target.Last year Reback led Netscape 's successful efforts to get the U.S. Justice Department to reopen its investigation of Microsoft , which in 1994 agreed to settle antitrust charges to end a four-year federal probe.Murray said the Justice Department is continuing the reopened investigation , which aims to determine whether Microsoft 's Internet marketing practices violate the company 's settlement agreement.Murray said it was not clear what aspects of Internet competition Texas was investigating.We are confident that once they have examined the facts they will agree that consumers are benefiting from the intense and healthy competition in internet software , he said.The letter from Tobey , chief of the antitrust section in Texas ' consumer protection division , said the state was trying to determine whether there had been any violations of the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act of 1983.Reback said it was not unusual for states to pursue antitrust actions separately from the federal government.It 's not uncommon , and in the past the state attorneys general have been in fact relatively active in merger enforcement and in a variety of antitrust contexts , he said.Texas officials could not be reached for comment .
Forestry giant Weyerhaeuser Co. Wednesday reported sharply lower fourth-quarter earnings , capping a year of mixed results dragged down by pulp and paper prices.Several other timber industry companies also reported comparatively weak fourth-quarter results blamed on poor market conditions.For the fourth quarter Weyerhaeuser posted earnings of $ 98 million or 50 cents a share , compared with $ 251 million or $ 1.25 a share a year earlier .
Revenues in the quarter fell to $ 2.8 billion from $ 3.1 billion.The earnings figure was above the Wall Street consensus of 48 cents a share mainly because of strong operating earnings in the company 's real estate business , analysts said.But Weyerhaeuser closed off $ 1 at $ 49.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.For the year Weyerhaeuser , based in Federal Way , Wash. , reported net income of $ 463 million or $ 2.34 a share , down from $ 983 million or $ 4.83 a share before a special charge in 1995 .
Revenues for the year fell to $ 11.1 billion from $ 11.8 billion.1996 was a year of mixed results , said John Creighton , Weyerhaeuser president and chief executive officer , who cited lower pulp and paper prices but solid demand for wood products in the United States and Japan.Pulp and paper operating earnings for the year fell to $ 307 million from a record $ 1.18 billion in 1995 .
Earnings from timberlands and wood products were virtually flat at $ 805 million , compared with $ 808 million.Portland , Ore.-based Louisiana-Pacific Corp. reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $ 14.7 million , or 14 cents a share , on sales of $ 567 million , compared with net income of $ 26.8 million or 25 cents a share on sales of $ 670.3 million a year earlier.For the year the company reported a net loss of $ 201 million , or $ 1.87 a share , blamed mainly on a pre-tax charge of $ 350 million for the closing of its pulp mill in Ketchikan , Alaska.In 1995 the company had a loss of $ 51.7 million or 48 cents a share including a pretax charge of $ 366.6 million mainly to account for the settlement of class-action lawsuits over the company 's siding.Louisiana-Pacific chairman and chief executive officer Mark Suwyn said the company had resolved key legal and organizational issues in 1996 but still faced an oversupply in the market for its key product of oriented strand board , used in building.Louisiana-Pacific stock closed up 25 cents at $ 21.Clayton , Mo.-based Jefferson Smurfit Corp. posted net income of $ 14 million , or 13 cents a share , for the fourth quarter , down from $ 64 million , or 57 cents a share , a year earlier .
Sales for the quarter were $ 816 million , compared with $ 973 million.For the full year the company earned $ 112 million , or $ 1.01 a share , compared with $ 243 million , or $ 2.19 a share .
Sales fell to $ 3.4 billion from $ 4.1 billion in 1995.Company president and chief executive officer Richard Graham said inventories in containerboard and newsprint have declined steadily over the past several months , promising some relief to the weak pricing environment.Given continued economic expansion , we could see a recovery in the company 's principal markets during the second half of 1997 , he said.Jefferson Smurfit fell 43.75 cents to close at $ 15.06 on Nasdaq .
Nike Inc. said Thursday that earnings jumped 77 percent in the latest quarter as worldwide sales of its athletic footwear and clothing surged.The Beaverton , Ore.-based company said net income rose to $ 237.1 million or 80 cents a share , in its fiscal third quarter ended on Feb. 28 , from $ 133.9 million , or 45 cents a share , a year earlier .
Revenue rose 53 percent to $ 2.42 billion from $ 1.58 billion.The earnings exceeded expectations of Wall Street analysts who had estimated Nike would earn 72 cents a share on average , according to First Call , which tracks profit forecasts.Nike said worldwide orders for footwear and apparel to be delivered from March through July rose 34 percent from the year-earlier period to $ 4.3 billion.All of us out here at Nike are delighted with the quarter , Chairman Phil Knight said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.In a statement , Knight said said revenues for the latest quarter rose more than 50 percent in each of the company 's four geographic regions -- the United States , Europe , Asia-Pacific and the Americas.This is remarkably balanced growth for a company with trailing 12-month revenues approaching $ 9 billion , Knight said.Nike said it U.S. sales of footwear and athletic apparel rose 51 percent to $ 1.34 billion , while international sales jumped 67 percent to $ 983 million .
International sales would have been up 78 percent if currency changes were ignored.Obviously these are great numbers , said analyst John Rogers of Jensen Securities in Portland , Ore .
The surprising thing was not only the overall sales growth and margin growth but particularly the international component.Nike officials said in the conference call the company 's international sales were on track to surpass U.S. sales somewhere around the year 2000.Rogers said the future orders figure , marking the 10th straight quarter of increases over 30 percent , was in line with estmimates.I think it 's more than likely that order rates will slow from here as comparisons get tougher , he said .
Microsoft Corp is expected to show a sharp 40 percent jump in quarterly earnings Thursday on strength of the software giant 's core business including the latest upgrade to its best-selling Office suite.On average analysts expect the Redmond , Wash.-based company to post earnings of $ 0.64 a share for its fiscal third quarter , compared with $ 0.44 a year ago after adjusting for a split , according to First Call .
Several analysts predicted revenues in the range of $ 2.9 billion , up about 32 percent from last year 's $ 2.2 billion and up from $ 2.68 billion in the December quarter.I think on balance it will be a very good quarter , said David Readerman , analyst at Montgomery Securities .
I do n't see any motivating factor why they should blow the number out.In January , Microsoft launched Office 97 , the latest version of its productivity applications such as word processing and spreadsheets that accounted for an estimated $ 2 billion of the company 's $ 8.7 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues .
Microsoft makes the bulk of its money from platforms including the operating systems preloaded onto new personal computers , which generate about third of the company 's revenues.But analysts said the fastest-growing driver of revenue continues to be the high-end Windows NT operating system and related products for back-end computer servers.Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs estimated that Microsoft 's BackOffice business , including NT , would be up 100 percent over the year-earlier quarter and represent about 20 percent of total revenues .
Analysts expect results from the current fourth quarter to be similar to the third , but Microsoft has warned that growth is likely to slow in the fiscal year that begins July 1.I do expect them to reiterate that fiscal '98 will represent a period of slower growth for the company , Sherlund said.While Microsoft is still benefiting from a mix shift to its more lucrative Windows 95 and Windows NT systems , analysts said it was not clear how planned updates to the products next year would affect revenues.They 're being very cryptic on pricing , said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie .
He said Microsoft had delayed release of the products in part because corporate customers were becoming confused by the proliferation of Windows flavors.Nevertheless , McAdams estimated Microsoft 's revenues in fiscal 1998 would rise 27 percent to $ 13.7 billion.The markets they 're playing in could double the size of the company , he said .
( ( -- Reuters Seattle bureau 206-386-4848 ) ) Itron Inc shares fell more than 25 percent after the company warned for the second quarter in a row that its results would fall short of expectations.Itron was off 8-1/2 at 20-1/2 after the company said it expected to post a loss in the current quarter rather than $ 0.18 a share profit that analysts had expected on average.The company blamed a utility industry slowdown in the pace of adopting its automated meter reading systems .
We believe the market slowdown is temporary as market forces will increasingly compel utilities to become more efficient providers , President and Chief Executive Officer Johnny Humphreys said in a statement.Itron stock peaked at a record 60 in late April but then plummeted after the company warned that second- and third-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations due to aggressive price competition .
In a conference call with analysts Wednesday , monitored on a tape-delayed basis , company executives said Itron could lose $ 0.10 to $ 0.20 a share in the current quarter , resulting in net income for the year in the $ 0.40 a share range , compared expectations of about $ 0.83.And executives said net income next year likely would rise only to about last year 's level of $ 0.78 a share , rather than the $ 1.29 a share analysts had expected on average , according to IBES .
The utilities that I 've talked to all tell me it 's a very good system , said John Rogers of Jensen Securities .
The question is when do they want to invest in it , and they have yet to make a complete commitment to it.Humphreys said in the conference call that the company had been investing heavily in its fixed network line of products , which is not expected to become profitable until 1998.Itron 's current line of products allow utility workers to read meters simply by walking or driving down the streets where the devices are installed and collecting the information sent out by radio signal.The network systems being tested include automated collection devices mounted on utility poles that would sned the information to a central point , virtually eliminating meter readers.While Spokane , Wash.-based Itron is the leader in the industry , the company faces competition from CellNet Data Systems Inc , which has filed for an initial public offering of stock and has just begin the process of meeting with potential investors , analysts said.It 's definitely a short-term setback , and it probably means that next year 's numbers are going to have to come down , but I think its a compelling long-term story , said analyst Rick Owens of Pacific Crest Securities , which downgraded its rating on the stock to hold from buy.He and other analysts said Itron had been expecting major utility orders for its meter-reading systems that repeatedly had been pushed into the future .
-- Seattle bureau 206-386-4848 As Delta Air Lines Inc. nears a decision on an aircraft order worth at least $ 2.5 billion , Boeing Co. reportedly is trying to persuade the carrier to lock it in as the long-term supplier for all its jet needs.The deal being considered , similar to an agreement reached with executives of American Airlines last year , could have broad ramifications for an aviation industry that is becoming increasingly consolidated , industry analysts said.The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Boeing was negotiating with Delta on a sole-source agreement that could involve up to 100 jets worth about $ 6 billion.Delta spokesman Bill Berry declined to comment on the reported Boeing proposal , although he acknowledged the airline was considering a purchase that would go well beyond its stated goal of two dozen wide-bodied jets needed to help retire 49 ageing Lockheed L-1011 airliners from Delta 's domestic routes.Berry said Delta was in final discussions with both Boeing and its European rival Airbus Industrie.We are now in very sensitive final discussions with the manufacturers , he said .
We would hope to have a decision in a matter of weeks .
But I ca n't tell you if it 's two weeks or six weeks or eight weeks.Boeing Chairman Phil Condit , in Brussels for a meeting with European regulators , said a sale to Delta was far from certain.We are in a very strong competition at Delta , Condit told a meeting organised by the European Aviation Club .
We have not reached any agreement at this point.Boeing stock rose $ 2 to $ 108.125 in New York Stock Exchange trading , and Delta gained $ 1.125 to $ 85.75.Delta 's current fleet of 531 jets is two-thirds Boeing , including some older narrow-body planes that need to be replaced or modified to meet upcoming noise requirements.A Boeing spokeswoman said the manufacturer was offering Delta its wide-body , twin-jet 777 , although the airline also is considering the slightly smaller 767-400ERX , which is not yet in production , a fact Airbus is emphasising.If they would want something right away they take one of current airplanes Boeing has or the ( Airbus ) A330 , so that 's where the battle is , said Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.Nick Heymann , an analyst at Natwest Securities , said the potential Delta deal could have huge ramifications for the future of how airlines get their equipment.Boeing 's strategy here is to be able to have such a complete product line that all their derivatives will be able to meet all their customers ' needs even as their customers ' markets fragment , he said.The one-stop shopping concept is spreading across the aviation industry as manufacturers seek to increase their share of the lucrative market in services , Heymann said.Just this week Boeing said it would eliminate its money-losing training organisation and instead offer training for commercial jet pilots and mechanics in a joint venture with Flight Safety International.General Electric Co. expanded its aircraft engine servicing business by agreeing to acquire Greenwich Air Services Inc. and UNC Inc. for a total of $ 875 million plus the assumption of debt.A deal with Delta would be similar to the agreement struck with American , a unit of AMR Corp. , last year worth at least $ 6.5 billion over the next five years and up to $ 25 billion or more over 20 years.But Wolfgang Demisch , analyst at BT Securities , pointed out that while the American deal has been described as a firm long-term commitment for the airline to buy all its jets from the Seattle-based manufacturer , it does not legally bind the carrier to accept prices that are not competitive.I view it as more of a statement of intent than anything else , he said .
Given recent strong airline traffic , rising profits and expectations of growth , he said Delta would be tempted to accept Boeing 's offer , which presumably guarantees competitive prices.Analyst Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities disagreed , saying Delta management has been historically conservative , particularly compared with American 's , and would be less likely to go with a single source.If you do that you lose the ability to pit each manufacturer off each other every time an order comes up , he said .
Microsoft Corp. said its third-quarter profit jumped 85 percent to $ 1.04 billion , well beyond analysts ' expectations , on strength in its core Windows business and the new Office 97 upgrade.The software giant 's net income of 79 cents a share compared with earnings of $ 562 million , or 44 cents a share , in last year 's fiscal third quarter .
Revenues rose to a record $ 3.21 billion , a 45 percent increase over the $ 2.21 billion racked up in the year-ago quarter.Analysts on average had forecast earnings of 64 cents a share and revenues of about $ 2.9 billion.While Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown reiterated that he expects growth to slow over the next year , analysts said they were impressed by the software giant 's continuing ability to rack up huge gains.I was floored , said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie , who predicted the stock would rise sharply Friday as analysts jack up their earnings estimates .
This was a 16-cylinder engine , and all cylinders were working.Microsoft released the results after financial markets closed .
In Nasdaq trading Thursday Microsoft fell 12.5 cents to $ 98.125 , but the stock rose as high as $ 102.75 in after-hours trading , dealers said.Microsoft credited strong revenues from the Office 97 bundle , released in January , which helped drive application and content revenues to $ 1.53 billion , up 24 percent from the year-earlier period.But revenues from Microsoft 's platform products , including the various Windows operating systems , rose 73 percent to $ 1.68 billion.Sales of software preloaded on new computers to the so-called OEM ( original equipment manufacturer ) channel , rose 51 percent , faster than the PC growth rate , reflecting a continued shift to the higher-priced Windows 95 operating system from the older Windows 3.x.In an interview , Brown said he expected growth to slow over the next five quarters based on difficult comparisons with year-earlier quarters and a lack of planned major new upgrades.Brown said he was very excited about the long-term future but said the earnings bar had been raised to an all-time Olympic record.We have n't had very many quarters in which EPS ( earnings per share ) went up 80 percent , he said .
That 's not a quarter-in , quarter-out type of thing .
This is just an incredible quarter.In fact , he said results from the current fourth quarter would be roughly equivalent to the period that just ended , and he predicted a modest sequential decline in revenues and earnings in the seasonally slow September quarter .
But after that sequential growth should resume , Brown said.Because Microsoft exceeded third-quarter expectations by 15 cents per share , analysts likely will have to raise fiscal 1997 estimates to about $ 2.65 per share from the previous $ 2.35 , McAdams said .
Fiscal 1998 estimates also are likely to be raised , he said.McAdams also pointed out that the company 's unearned revenues of $ 1.29 billion included an additional 13 cents per share that was taken in but not recognized as earnings in the quarter .
Microsoft defers some revenues to account for costs over the life cycle of products such as Windows and Office.While Microsoft routinely beats earnings estimates , analysts said they had not even heard a whisper of the blowout number , and Microsoft 's stock has traded in a relatively narrow range over the past two months.It 's just an extraordinarily well-managed company to deliver that kind of earnings upside on this size of a revenue base , said analyst David Readerman of Montgomery Securities .
Microsoft Corp on Monday plans to announce a version of its Windows 95 operating system for hand-held consumer devices that will be available this year , according to sources familiar with the company 's plans.The Windows CE system for consumer electronics comes two years after Microsoft scuttled a similar project known as Winpad because its intensive memory requirements would have made the hardware too costly.Since then the explosive growth of the Internet has expanded the market possibilities for small wireless devices , while Microsoft rival Oracle Corp has popularised the concept of a $ 500 consumer device for accessing the Internet.Microsoft officials declined to comment , but the company said it would have an announcement on Monday on a significant addition in the area of Microsoft Windows platform software.Microsoft executives previously had disclosed plans to supply a system for hand-held devices in time for the holiday season.The devices , ranging from a smart wireless telephone to personal organisers with communcations capabilities , will be marketed by eight computer and consumer electronics companies including Hewlett-Packard Co. , Casio Computer Co. Ltd. , and Philips Electronics NV , industry analysts said.The operating system will include stripped-down versions of Microsoft 's Word and Excel applications and are likely to have some ability to get information off the Internet 's World Wide Web.But with their tiny , monochrome screens , analysts believe they will be used at first largely for accessing electronic mail and personal information such as telephone numbers and appointments.The Web does n't look good on a 4-inch screen , said analyst Mike McGuire of Dataquest .
What this is about is Internet transactions and communications.While hand-held personal digital assistants such as Apple Computer Inc. 's Newton have been available for several years the products have failed to grow beyond a niche category in part because of the difficulty of swapping information between them and desktop computers , analysts say.Microsoft aims to break that logjam with its new system , built for RISC microprocessors from Hitachi and others rather than the Intel Corp. processors used for most Windows-based computers.But at $ 500 -- or close to $ 1,000 for a machine fully loaded with communications accessories -- price will continue to be an obstacle , said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group , who said the sweet spot for small devices was about $ 300.I do n't really think the market is going to really jump off in big number until next year , he said.McGuire of Dataquest estimated worldwide shipments of hand-held devices would rise to at least five million units a year by the end of the decade from the current one million.While that 's still relatively small compared with a personal computer market of about 60 million units annually , Microsoft needs to protect its Windows franchise from any potential incursion , said analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie.If you let someone else get that operating system , over time someone could start working that system upmarket , he said .
Microsoft needs to be a player here.Microsoft move into hand-held systems could pose a threat to U.S. Robotics Corp. and Britain 's Psion Software Plc , two of the most successful marketers of proprietary hand-held products.The Windows CE system also could be licensed for use with a rival to Oracle 's Network Computer , analysts said .
Chechnya 's main oil refinery once sent popes the finest paraffin wax they needed for the Vatican 's holy candles .
Now the shell-scarred plant barely flickers with activity , wasting away after two years of war.Russian bombs no longer fall on the mainly Moslem region 's capital Grozny .
But the aftermath of the independence struggle with Moscow has left the century-old refinery to battle an army of Chechens who steal its oil to make illicit petrol.It is a wild , bootleg industry unmatched anywhere else in the world .
Legions of local people eke out a living by scooping up crude oil from idled wells across the republic and making what must be the world 's worst gasoline.It is a windfall for some of Chechnya 's million-strong population , left destitute by the fighting which ended last year .
But it deprives the refinery of badly-needed supplies and is holding back the reconstruction of an oil industry that was the mainstay of the economy in Soviet times.The illicit trade is not the oil-riches dream that rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev promised Chechens , who sit on only small oil reserves but control a key pipeline route in the North Caucasus.Dudayev said that after we built a new pipeline , we 'd all live in houses with gold-plated taps flowing with camel 's milk , said a young Chechen who would give only his nickname , 'Cyclone ' .
He promised people gold roofs , too.There is little gold yet in Chechnya , where there is virtually no infrastructure or real economy .
Roads resemble the surface of the moon .
Every man seems to have a loaded sub-machinegun and a jar of home-made petrol to sell but no obvious job.ILLEGAL REFINING ONE OF FEW SOURCES OF INCOMEBlack-market refining , begun as a wartime necessity , is now one of Chechnya 's few sources of income .
The simple chemistry requires little more than stolen crude oil , bath-like containers , siphoned natural gas , water , and , for a dash of colour , powdered drink mix.Wartime leader Aslan Maskhadov was elected president a month ago after the Russian army finally quit the region , and promised to consolidate Chechnya 's de facto independence by rebuilding the economy .
He has vowed to end the bootlegging.But everybody 's doing it .
There is little work in Chechnya .
According to official figures , nearly 90 percent have no job .
As many as one in four Chechens may be involved in the illegal petrol trade , officials say.LOW OCTANE BUT FULL OF EVILThe bootleggers tend to work stealthily at night , raiding idle oil wells under the cover of darkness.In Tsotsin-Yurt , a tiny village 35 km ( 20 miles ) southeast of Grozny , 23-year-old Lyomi , a tomato grower before the war , stood knee-deep in mud , refining petrol.Thick black smoke billowed in the barren distance on the foothills of the snow-capped Caucasus mountains , marking the well from which Lyomi steals his suuplies.Driving the oil across a landscape of mud and snow , he dumps it into a boiler heated with natural gas siphoned from a nearby pipeline .
It is then piped to a pit under which lies a cistern -- also purloined -- that is cooled with water.Then it trickles over to another cistern .
That 's it .
First he gets acetone , then gasoline , then diesel and then paraffin.The product is put into three-litre ( one gallon ) glass jars and sprinkled with a packet of Turkish-made soft drink mix for a pale lemon-green tint , mimicking the real thing.The low-octane petrol , sold on streets and country roads across Chechnya , wrecks engines , does few kilometres to the litre ( miles to the gallon ) and has spawned an active , if ultimately futile , car repair business.There 's no other work , Lyomi said , wiping his smudged face .
It 's not worth shutting down .
There are no other jobs.BATTLE AGAINST BOOTLEGGERSBack in Grozny , Khozhakhmed Yarikhanov , president of the Southern Oil Company , or YUNKO , and Chechnya 's highest oil official , told Reuters that operations like Lyomi 's must be closed so that the real refinery can have enough oil to process.Today , oil is the only source of income for the republic , he said at his spartan office .
It was my idea to close down the home refineries and we will do it .
He knows it will be tough.Bootleggers greatly upset refinery director Baudin Khamidov , who fears his chances to renew supplies to the Pope and make top-flight lubricants for military jets are slipping away.If we took the 4,000 tonnes a day that the bootleggers are stealing from the wells , we could solve our economic problems , he said at the main refinery , the Grozny Oil-Refining Combine.This is the very greatest evil in the republic.The plant was built by the British during the first Caucasus oil boom of the 1890s .
In Soviet times it processed oil brought in from Siberia .
With foreigners rushing to open up vast reserves in the landlocked Caspian , Grozny hopes to cash in on a new flow of oil across its territory to Black Sea ports.But for now , the refinery shows only faint signs of life .
A mangy but well-fed dog slept in the sun next to hissing pipes , and wisps of steam curled lazily in the crisp winter air.Our paraffin was considered the best in the world , sighed Viktor Petrov , deputy director and former papal supplier.We were pretty badly hit during the war , Khamidov said.Out of action most of last year , the plant has begun processing tiny amounts of oil .
But against battalions of bootleggers it is losing the battle for local crude supplies.We have no feedstock ( supplies ) , Khamidov said , complaining that Moscow had ceased sending Siberian oil.You do n't see this anywhere else in the world .
Russian demand for imported sugar has picked up earlier than usual on the eve of the beet harvest , and traders said less price volatility and more consolidation were adding stability to the domestic market.Demand is normal , prices are stabilising , said a senior trade source .
There 's sugar coming into the ports and demand is good.He said raws would need to arrive by mid-July to be processed at domestic refineries before the Russian beet crop supplanted them as a feedstock.The ( Russian ) market is strong at the moment , said a second senior trade source .
You are seeing demand for sugar at the moment .
There is some pretty intensive importing of raws right now -- the price structures make tolling profitable.Traders debated market talk of sugar backlogs at the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk and whether Russia could soak up any unplaced cargoes looking for homes.If you have raws arriving in the Black Sea in July , you 'll be pressed , said the first source , adding that refineries needed 14-21 days for processing and that they would be less keen to contract for raws as the beet harvest approached.Recent market talk that around 250,000 tonnes of raws , possibly Brazilian , could be expected later this summer in Novorossiisk or the Baltics was still speculative , traders said.A Novorossiisk port source said that a backlog of Cuban raws at the outlet had edged down only slightly to 80,700 tonnes from around 90,000 tonnes last week because the Russian receiver was not ready to take delivery.He said the port expected to receive around 200,000 tonnes of raws , probably of Cuban origin , this summer , including 70,000 tonnes of unknown origin before June.Indian refined white sugar stocks in port warehouses were around 400,000 tonnes , the port source said , but the senior trade sources said it was overblown by a factor of ten or more.Russia is heading into its traditional jam-making season , a major factor that spurs a rise in refined sugar imports.People are preempting a little , because demand does n't normally pick up until end-June , said the first trade source , adding , the high-quality sugar market is much stronger -- you 're seeing significant demand , especially at the Western ( beverage ) bottlers ( with Russia operations ) .Sources said domestic sugar reserves were being drawn down but that a fundamental , long-term pick-up in consumer demand had yet to materialise .
Some traders see Russian demand as fairly price inelastic and relatively steady despite economic decline and tight disposable income.Russian consumption is about five million tonnes a year.There is less room for European sugar in Russia , which meets most of its needs by importing whites from Ukraine and refining Cuban raws and its own sugar beets.But the structure of the Russian market is changing.The market is consolidating -- it 's a natural market development , said the first source , adding that the days of suppliers having to leap over three or four middlemen to get to buyers were gone.You 're getting directly at the refiners , and you 're cutting out the wild ( price ) swings , he said.A big glut in 1995 , in which buyers imported too much and demand failed to take off as hoped , forced changes in distribution networks that were now consolidating the market.The domestic market will remain strong but it wo n't go crazy , said the first trader .
But hopefully this will establish a pattern. -- Moscow Newsroom , +7095 941 8520 Russia 's oil sector , fresh from its smallest fall in output after a decade of plunging , may find it tough to keep up the momentum in the coming years , officials and analysts said on Thursday.Analysts ' consensus is that production will not pick up before 1999 or 2000 , said Elena Merkoulova , Russian energy analyst at Salomon Brothers in London.Output fell two percent to 6.03 million barrels per day last year , its lowest level in three decades , although the drop in percentage terms was the smallest since 1987.But output from the world 's third largest oil producer has fallen again in the first two months of this year to an average 5.60 million bpd .
This is two percent lower than year-ago levels.Some producers have said that total output could be halved by the year 2000 under existing tax regimes.Analysts believe this is highly unlikely and the era of steep declines appears to be over .
But they say the upturn will be rocky and that slippage will continue.The drop we saw at the beginning of the year wo n't continue through the rest of the year , said Sintez energy analyst Gennady Vasilyev .
He forecast that total 1997 output would edge down one percent from 1996.But the Fuel and Energy Ministry , citing increasingly scarce cash , high taxes and ageing , less productive wells , fears that stagnation could follow the steep decline.In these conditions , the relative stabilisation in energy output achieved in 1996 is only a temporary phenomenon , the ministry said.It does not offer hopeful grounds for strengthening the slowdown in the rate of decline needed for the short term development programme to 2000 , it said in its latest InfoTEK bulletin.Around 26 percent of Russia 's 139,000 wells are not operating and existing tax regimes make many of them unprofitable to rehabilitate .
Exploration drilling fell by a third in 1996.Such cuts in the sector 's production potential pose a threat to the medium-term stabilisation programme to 2000 , the ministry said.Analysts said producers saw few reasons to invest what little cash they had in production when the government was pushing them to supply more crude to domestic refineries and to deliver oil products to the ailing farm sector.Investment by oil firms in production shrank 26 percent last year , with YUKOS , Russia 's second largest oil producer , cutting investment by half .
A third of oil companies finished 1996 in the red.Russia 's draft Tax Code may make special provisions for producers , who pay around 53 percent of the wholesale price of each barrel of oil in taxes and tariffs .
Boosting output depends upon lower taxes and tariffs , they say.The easy-to-recover reserves have been depleted , and it is going to take a lot of money and technology to get the other reserves , Merkoulova said .
No one wants to produce a lot until the excise tariff on production is resolved. -- Moscow Newsroom , +7095 941 8520 No roads link Russia 's Arctic city of Norilsk to the rest of the world .
A flight across the Siberian tundra or a trip across the frozen Kara Sea are the only ways to reach this gigantic mining and smelting centre.A lone highway from Norilsk airport to the company town winds across blinding , snow-blanketed tundra , across which locals say lurk an array of nuclear missiles primed to strike.After an hour 's bumpy ride , the Arctic sun struggles behind a pall of filth and Norilsk , one of the world 's biggest metals combines and a monument to Soviet industrial might , rises menacingly from a gruesome , gritty blanket of smelter fumes.The dark air here is so polluted that for the average local resident , life ends at 50.Apartment hallways can be covered in blue ice when temperatures drop below minus 50 Celsius ( -58 Fahrenheit ) in winter.Norilsk was built for working , not living , said Andrei Samokhin , spokesman for Norilsk Nickel , the company that effectively is the town .
There 's nothing to do but work.DEADLY PAST , POISONED FUTURE , LITTLE GOLD FOR WORKERSNorilsk pulses with the ghosts of at least 100,000 political prisoners whom Soviet dictator Josef Stalin exiled to this forsaken spot in the 1930s and 40s to work one of the planet 's richest , but most desolate , sites for turning mineral deposits of nickel , platinum , gold and other ores into pure metals.For Mitrofan Rubeko , a rare 85-year-old survivor of Stalin 's purges , Norilsk , 200 miles ( 320 km ) north of the Arctic Circle , is an outpost of outrage .
None of the young want to remember the history of Norilsk , he said in his spartan apartment.Norilsk has no monument to the innocent victims of forced labour , no mention of them in the town museum and no talk of one of the most prominent episodes in the Soviet Union 's climb to a communist industrial heaven .
Not one book has been published in Russia on the town 's real history .
Company officials have ignored Rubeko 's request to erect a monument.Norilsk does have a monument to the town 's first engineers .
Most were officers in the secret police that later became the KGB .
They supervised thinly clad prisoners labouring in the open air and sleeping in wooden barracks with ice floors.Norilsk now has three nickel and copper smelters , two of them skeletal dinosaurs belching poisonous gases .
It has metals processing and enriching plants and some of the world 's richest mines of nickel , platinum , palladium , cobalt , copper and gold.The new generations of Norilsk 's 300,000 residents -- some descendents of Stalin 's victims , others children of later , hardy souls who headed north decades ago for higher wages -- are miners and metalworkers who look a decade older than they are.It 's so ecologically dangerous in Norilsk , you are n't even supposed to give birth here , said Sergei Yurshov , director of the main nickel plant 's electrolysing unit.Norilsk says it is in the throes of financial crisis -- but its streets are literally paved with gold.Tonnes of filthy cancer-inducing black slag , sparkling with precious metals , are collected from the smelters and sifted over streets to keep them from freezing.The state sees the bullion , but this is all we see , said Boris Degtyarov , an official at the main trade union.There is more beautiful poison at the electrolysing plant , where luminous , lime-green liquid nickel , laced with electricity , is processed from matt black slabs glinting with the earth 's most prized metals.The dark cobbled floors and 1940s technology , exposing steel entrails and frames of processing lines , have a mediaeval air.Concentrations of carcinogenic nickel in the air are 200 times Western norms and 20,000 times the worthy but never attained Soviet standard.In Norilsk , women retire at 40 , men at 45 .
Degtyarov says 90 percent of newborn babies have serious illnesses or handicaps .
An aura of illness pervades everything here .
One mine , Keyerkan , means Valley of Death in the language of the local Dolgan people.Despite the richness of its ore mines , Norilsk has not created wealth for its workers.Difficulties in keeping tabs on just who exports its multi-billion dollar output , and vast tax arrears have not helped the labour force , whose wages are two months behind.Where 's the money for the metals going ?
asked Rubeko , shaking his silver-haired head .
That I can not understand.A FROZEN , UNDERGROUND HELLDeep in the Taimyr mine , 1.5 km ( one mile ) below the permafrost , is a darker world , where miners labour round the clock in shifts and cavernous tunnels worm through the earth.Get lost and you are in severe danger -- engineers daily blast out new galleries with dynamite .
The rule for finding the way out -- hold up a wet finger and sense the faint breeze from the ventilation shaft.The lift , a 15 minute or so ride , rumbles like a distant rocket 's afterburners.The lift cables are rusted , said duty operator , Sergei .
But we love our jobs , he added , inciting laughter from miners waiting to be ferried down into the bowels of the Arctic.The Soviet authorities saw Norilsk as the embodiment of the socialist city-factory and as an organising principle for society .
Now the remains of that vision are being tested by new market forces .
Already hundreds of homeless live in the town 's boiler plants.Company officials speak of uprooting pensioners to warmer climes , where they would cost less to support , and of the need to trim a bloated workforce.The plans have made Norilsk a barometer of the troubles faced by Russian industries in casting off their Soviet legacy .
But they are hotly contested.You 'd need two Kalashnikovs for every policeman if you had a load of unemployed wandering these streets , Degtyarov said.Rubeko , dragged to Norilsk in 1938 after a midnight knock at his door in southern Russia , despairs at the thought of a second exile .
You ca n't resettle an 85-year-old man , he said.After working at Norilsk for 66 years , Rubeko , now head of the local chapter of the Society for the Defence of the Victims of Stalinist Repressions , can not even afford new shoes.When asked what Norilsk was for him , he answered , a grave.But he is not a dead soul.People related better to each other in the old days -- they were kinder and more spiritual.Everyone thought Stalin would die and we would survive this , he said with a smile .
And that is what happened .
Russian refineries , pressured by growing domestic demand for transport fuels and cleaner specifications in export markets , are nonetheless a long way from producing lighter products , analysts said.You should not expect any significant changes in the composition of the Russian barrel in the next three to five years , said Pavis Shahidi , a refining expert at Bechtel International Inc in London.All the upgrading projects are still awaiting financing.Russia 's 28 major refineries have plans to install conversion systems and some are in talks with international lending institutions on multi-million dollar financing .
But none of the major proposals , whose total cost will ring in at around $ 12 billion , are truly off the ground.It requires a lot of money , and investment is hard to get in this country , said Peter Lukyanov of Universal Oil Product in Moscow .
But it is a priority for Russian producers , because it 's a big ( financial ) loss to do heavy fuel oil instead of lighter products.Conversion levels at Russian refineries are 50-55 percent , with fuel oil comprising the balance of output , compared to 75-80 percent conversions at leading foreign facilities.Deeper treatment technologies are in use in only 10 percent of current refining capacity and Russia has not one single hydrocracker , analysts said.One result is that Russia will continue to produce vast quantities of heavy fuel oil , or mazut , with the sludgy , heavy product now comprising 40 percent or more of oil product output.Liz Barrett , an energy specialist at CentreInvest Group consultancy in Moscow , said another factor stymieing efforts by refineries to finance conversion technologies was the focus of top managers at the new vertically integrated oil firms on upstream , not downstream , projects.Most of the refineries are looking at hydrocrackers ( as opposed to less costly but less flexible catalytic crackers ) because they want low sulphur diesels , she added.Russia 's Soviet-era refineries were designed three and more decades ago to serve a domestic planned economy , and many , especially those clustered in the Volga-Urals region , may not have good export marketing potential.The Russian refineries are positioned to supply local markets , and with export and transport costs expensive , it makes it difficult to arrange financing for upgrades , Shahidi said.But under-utilisation -- Russian plants operate at an average 55 percent of their 6.8 million barrels per day capacity -- has meant some refineries run reforming units more severely and in greater volumes , creating more material for desulphuring diesel.This is actually how the Russians are making more low-sulphur material , Barrett said.Russia turns out some cracked product but it is not high quality .
The product is not upgraded -- it 's not the result of new conversion processes , Lukyanov said , when asked why some Western traders might be seeing more cracked material.In spite of the lack of changes in refining technologies here , fuel oil output has dropped this year on the back of higher crude oil exports and , some analysts say , scaled-back use at bankrupt domestic military-industrial plants.Russia produced 21.9 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil in the first four months of the year , down four percent from the same year-ago period , State Statistics Committee figures show.This represented 38 percent of total refinery throughput of 57.7 million tonnes in the first four months. -- Moscow Newsroom , +7095 941 8520 The world 's second largest nickel producer , Russia 's Norilsk Nickel , averted a dockworkers ' strike on Monday but spoke of its dire financial straits and told employees to steel themselves for cutbacks.A group of workers at Norilsk , a town built by Soviet-era forced labour in the Arctic Circle , called off their threat to stop loading metals for export from the port of Dudinka , Norilsk spokesman Sergei Vetchinin said.But he said the company was in deep financial trouble -- surprising analysts who had thought RAO Norilsk Nikel 's new majority shareholder , Uneximbank , was closer to turning the giant nickel , copper and precious metals producer around.There is an appalling collapse at Norilsk , said metals trader Ruslan Fedorovsky of Barclays Physical Trading Ltd in London .
It 's a complete breakdown and there is little control over the situation.Vetchinin said lay-offs could hit 80,000 non-production employees at Norilsk 's flagship combine .
You would think this is a construction outfit , not a mining and metallurgy plant , he said , referring to the number of ancillary workers.We 've described the depths of our financial crisis and they understand , he said , adding that 800 billion ( Corrects from 800 million ) roubles ( $ 150 million ) of delayed wages would be paid off by November.But Norilsk workers , once laid off , have nowhere to go -- leaving markets to wonder how labour unrest and sluggish cash flow could affect the company 's production and exports.A number of us were surprised by the depth and severity of the problems there , said metals analyst Raj Kohli of MC Securities in London .
There will be some ongoing disruptions.Norilsk is looking to state bail-outs and a share issue to pay off its total 13 trillion rouble ( $ 2.3 billion ) debt and plans a new financial austerity programme by November as part of its restructuring scheme , Vetchinin said.But he said Uneximbank , a big commercial bank whose founders include Soviet-era state commodities exporters , had no more cash to pump into Norilsk.Norilsk , which has long said it is revamping the way it exports metals abroad , said it would focus on selling to end-users like German stainless steel group Krupp Thyssen Nirosta GmbH ( KTN ) , which groups Fried Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp and Thyssen AG.The move could leave Western commodities houses fighting over fewer contracts.Metals analysts are surprised that Norilsk 's strong 1995 pre-tax profit of nearly 5.5 trillion roubles ( $ 1 billion ) ( Corrects dollar conversion of rouble figure from $ 95 billion ) has not translated into enough cash to meet immediate needs like overdue salaries and back taxes.Vetchinin said that softer world metals prices meant that even exporters who pre-paid were not providing enough cash.Norilsk produced 180,100 tonnes of nickel in 1995 , up 11 percent on 1994 , and sees 1996 production rising three percent.The more major issue is how much longer it can go without big investments in its fixed assets , Kohli said , adding that around $ 1 billion was a ballpark figure needed.But we 're optimistic , because as an ore body it 's extremely wealthy and can produce large volumes at relatively low cost.Still , others expect possible volatility in Norilsk 's production and exports .
( $ 1 = 5,376 ) Pinning down the size of Russia 's grain harvest is proving a problem for analysts and traders due to widely differing estimates from official and trade groups.Various government and private-sector predictions put Russia 's net grain output at anywhere from 70 to 80 million tonnes -- a range which could leave Moscow with one of its worst harvests ever or give it a more comfortable margin.The situation is still tense and serious , said independent agriculture specialist Andrei Sizov of SovEcon Ltd consultancy on Friday , citing miniscule stocks from last year 's harvest .
But Arkady Zlochevsky , president of the OGO grain and food trading company , one of Russia 's largest , saw net grain output at 80 million tonnes .
We are not optimists , we are realists -- we know how much peasants and regional administrations water down the real figures , he said.The various numbers see output recovering anywhere from 11 to 21 percent from last year 's drought-hit 63.4 million tonnes.Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun said in June , his last public forecast , that he saw output at 70 million tonnes , while Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha , who is in charge of the harvest , put the figure this week at 75-77 million tonnes .
In a separate estimate , the state statistics committee sees output at 71-72 million tonnes.Sizov said he saw net output at 70 million tonnes.A Russian source at a Western industry organisation put it at 74-75 million tonnes , based on recent talks with other trade sources in Moscow and abroad .
These are the figures we 've got right now , the source said .
I think they 're realistic.The state meteorological service , which bases its forecasts on weather conditions only , and not on factors like tractor availability , sees output in the 71-75 million tonne range .
The International Grains Council sees the crucial Russian wheat harvest alone rising to 34 million tonnes , while Zlochevksy sees 37 million tonnes.The lower-range net output numbers still mean the 1996 harvest could be one of the worst three since 1965.The Russian government will not issue a final figure until at least the first two weeks of October , when the harvest officially ends -- leaving trade sources now to watch the all-important Siberian harvest , key to regional supplies .
The harvest in the European part of Russia is nearly over and pretty much a known entity -- the focus right now is Western and Eastern Siberia , Sizov said.In Siberia , farmers are battling weeks of rains that have moved the harvest closer to the date of the first snow , which can come as early as the end of the month.I think they could lose three or four million tonnes there , due to the weather , one trade source said .
-- Moscow Newsroom , +7095 941 8520 The titans of Russia 's aluminium sector said there were few chances of output disruptions to the world 's largest exporter as a result of a row over Western participation in the industryAsked if Moscow could renationalise the sector , a senior official close to the Bratsk smelter -- Russia 's and the world 's largest -- said , I ca n't say that it 's impossible.But he added , All the smelters have a unified position of solidarity .
The enterprises will win this argument and output will not be affected.Oleg Presman , deputy chief executive of the Krasnoyarsk smelter , Russia 's second largest , said in a telephone interview that Russia 's top aluminium executives were drafting a letter to Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov to address his concerns about foreign presence in the sector.Kulikov stepped up a war of words with London-based Trans-World Group -- a commodities giant working closely with Russian smelters -- saying on Tuesday that a probe into what he called crimes in Russia 's aluminium sector was justified.Kulikov , in a letter to Trans-World executive chairman David Reuben , a copy of which the ministry faxed to Reuters , said domestic producers needed protection from foreign metals companies to compete and survive.Among other stakes , Trans-World has about 30 percent in Bratsk , 11 percent of voting shares in Krasnoyarsk and a non-controlling stake in the smaller Novokuznetsk smelter.But domestic aluminium executives defended the presence of foreign companies like Trans-World on the Russian market , saying that they had saved Russian plants with tolling arrangements.If Kulikov puts an end to tolling , he 'll put an end to the Russian aluminium sector , the senior official said.Where is he going to get $ 2 billion ?
he said , referring to the cash smelters would have to raise if they severed links with suppliers like Trans-World and bought their own raw materials to produce primary aluminium.Russian primary aluminium exports last year were the world 's largest at 2.44 million tonnes out of total domestic output of 2.87 million tonnes.Kulikov said there was no question of confiscating property -- which Trans-World said was reassuring.But Kulikov said tolling -- in which commodities companies import alumina , give it to smelters to make primary aluminium and then take the product back for export -- had deprived smelters of earning more money from exports.But smelters said they also make money on the arrangement.If tolling were not advantageous for us , we would n't do it , Presman said.Igor Prokopov , chief executive of the Kontsern Alyuminiy producers ' group , said that a group letter being drafted would deny that Russian aluminium was a dirty business.We are not in any way involved in criminal deals , he said.The Prosecutor-General said last Friday that it was activating an investigation originally started by the Interior Ministry into what it called crimes in the aluminium sector.It 's unpleasant when a factory is under pressure , Presman said , referring to the probe .
But when asked if the quarrel could hit output or exports , he said , I do n't think so.The stepping up of the probe came days after Reuben , in commentaries and advertisements in international newspapers , said Moscow was smearing him for his business in Russia.There are some normal questions and some incorrect ones , said Presman , referring to materials Kulikov had on the sector.Maybe the materials Kulikov was given ( to examine ) were true , but some of the conclusions about those materials are incorrect , he said , adding that Kulikov 's call for tariffs on alumina imports were damaging.When asked if tolling in Russia would continue , he said , I think yes -- as long we still need it economically. -- Moscow Newsroom , +7095 941 8520 The newest challenge for Russia , now that it has lumbered over the hurdles of privatisation and market liberalisation , is reforming its giant natural monopolies to underpin long-term economic growth , analysts said on Tuesday.But reforming prices and boosting competition in the gas , electricity and railway monoliths -- as well as tackling the most resilient leftovers of the Soviet planned economy -- could be the toughest economic task yet in this vast country.The monopolies are the government 's newest makeover target , castigated for functioning largely as they did in Soviet days , when production costs were irrelevant , competition non-existent and prices bore no relationship to reality.Prices for industrial consumers have risen astronomically as Russia 's markets take hold , but the new pricing -- domestic customers pay a fraction of real costs -- does not reflect market principles.Analysts said price distortions were hurting the economy , with far-reaching effects ranging from consumers not paying for supplies to shortfalls in budget revenue and commodities houses unable to import grain because of high domestic rail tariffs.The theoretical principle is very simple , said Jochen Wermuth , an economist and adviser at the Finance Ministry .
If you abolish cross-subsidies and introduce territorially differentiated price structures , you 'll see more competition.But Russia 's monopolies can see only fine-tuning , rather than the major overhaul the International Monetary Fund wants as a condition of its $ 10 billion , three-year loan to Moscow.Each monopoly faces similar problems , but all drag their feet and need prodding from the Kremlin to change old ways.Gazprom GAZP.RTS , the natural gas monopoly and the world 's largest gas company , needs to release its stranglehold on production and distribution.To a certain extent Gazprom is pretending to talk about restructuring , said Renaissance Capital oil and gas analyst Alexei Kokin .
It may help it work more efficiently but it wo n't introduce competition ( in gas distribution ) .National electricity firm UES EESR.RTS , both a producer and a transmitter , must create a wholesale electricity market and allow regional producers to sell directly to end-users.But the tightly-integrated system was set up so that regional generators could send excess supplies to areas needing more , and some analysts said giving the regional energos a free rein could wreak havoc in the short-term.If consumers could chose their own providers , they would go for the cheapest supplies , which would lead to no demand at other producers and shortages in certain areas , said Marina Oganesian , energy analyst at Troika-Dialog in Moscow.Analysts said the railways monopoly , still a ministry , must stop subsidising passengers with prices many times lower than commercial rates that have influenced the economics of everything from oil exports to grain imports.Russia 's newest economic whiz kid , First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov , wants UES to lower prices and allow competition among producers , but he and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin have ruled out breaking up either UES or Gazprom.The three monopolies , coupled with the oil pipeline export network , account for 40 percent of budget revenues but are a main source of a nonpayments crisis crippling Russian industry.Just 10 percent of electricity consumers pay their bills in cash , while UES , Gazprom 's biggest domestic client , owes the gas giant billions .
UES collects only half of what it is owed.Clearly , if you keep having a distorted price structure , it 's not good for long-term growth , Wermuth said , adding he expected major changes this year but that they would be painful.The biggest beneficiaries of monopoly restructuring would be industrial enterprises , whose output contracted an average six percent in 1996 , and the monopolies themselves , which would find it easier to collect for supplies delivered.The scale of monopolies whose gas pipelines , powerlines and railroads cover tens of thousands of km ( miles ) makes restructuring both urgent and difficult .
It 's a big advantage for Russia to be so big -- the hugeness is in fact the argument for efficiency of the energy system , Wermuth said .
Russian oil producers are striving to seize control of a chunk of the country 's crude oil exports , leaving traders wondering if their glory days in the world 's third largest oil producer could be turning sour.Russia 's newest oil majors , racing to integrate vertically and to exert more control over deliveries abroad , say they need the profits that traders earn on state-sponsored exports to invest in production and expansion at home.Russian and Western traders say they are more experienced on logistical matters like contacts with Western buyers and better able to deal with constant revisions in the export schedule set by oil pipeline monopoly Transneft.You ca n't just call Russian oil companies producers any more -- they 're all trying to get control of exports as part of their integration processes , a Russian trader said.The battle is for state-sponsored exports called federal programmes which aim to help raise cash for state projects .
Worth $ 2- $ 3 billion a year , the programmes let companies buy oil at home , send it abroad and pay less in taxes and tariffs.Traders dominate exports for state needs , which comprised 23 percent of Russia 's two million barrels per day ( bpd ) oil exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States last year .
Russian output totalled 6.03 million bpd.But producers , backed by the Fuel and Energy Ministry , want this to change -- and they may be seeing first signs of victory.Oil companies , against the backdrop of more solvent domestic consumers , have succeeded in restricting sales of their resources to trading companies which export for state needs , wrote the Fuel and Energy Ministry 's InfoTEK agency in its latest monthly bulletin.As a result , the majority of traders have not been able to export the oil they planned to for state needs .
But the results for oil companies which export for state needs are quite different , it said , citing smooth deliveries by producers over the first two months of this year.A second Russian trader said producers were offering crude oil to traders at increasingly high prices , which was cutting into profits and making state exports less attractive.InfoTEK said oil trading company Nafta-Moskva could not get any of the oil it was to export under federal programmes in January or February , but a Nafta-Moskva source said the firm had managed to secure 230,000 tonnes for state exports in March.A Western oil trader said the fight could soon get even hotter , citing market rumours that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin could sign an order cutting federal programmes.Traders are lesser but still significant players in commercial exports , which account for about three-quarters of Russia 's $ 13 billion a year oil exports .
But producers are also seeking an even bigger role in these deliveries.LUKoil , Russia 's largest oil producer , said it was building a fleet of 10 river vessels with a total deadweight capacity of 66,100 tonnes to move its oil and products better .
It also said it was planning a fleet of sea going tankers.This is part of our strategy to make oil exports more optimal , said LUKoil spokesman Pyotr Neyev.Mini-major Sibneft , which accounted for nearly five percent of Russia 's total crude exports last year , said earlier this week it would handle its own oil exports from April.The struggle to control the flow of oil is also affecting Russia 's refining industry , with traders saying producers are increasingly unwilling to sell oil to outsiders for processing.We tried to get oil to supply refineries , but it 's very difficult to make a lot of money doing that , said a second Russian trader , adding that low utilisation rates boosted costs.Producers on average supply refineries with two thirds of the oil they process each year and the rest is from traders.Integrated oil companies own only 19 of Russia 's 28 major refineries .
They have a total capacity of 4.6 million bpd , or 75 percent of Russia 's total capacity , but processed 2.5 million bpd last year , working at an average 56 percent of capacity. -- Moscow Newsroom , +7095 941 8520 CEZ a.s. , the Czech Republic 's main electricity generator , posted higher than expected 1996 profits on Friday , though company officials were not as optimistic about the company 's bottom line this year.CEZ said its preliminary 1996 net profit , calculated under international accounting standards , edged up to 9.7 billion crowns from 9.31 billion in 1995.Under Czech accounting , which differs in areas such as interest payments , leasing payments and measuring profits and losses carried over from previous years , net profit dipped to 7.85 billion from 8.06 billion.Petr Voboril , head of CEZ 's planning department , said the result was slightly above the firm 's expectations , adding that the company had funds to pay its first-ever dividend , expected to be between 30 and 45 crowns per share on the earnings.The profit is on the level where we expected , or little above that , Voboril told reporters and analysts.Analysts too were encouraged by the figures and dividend announcement , though CEZ shares failed to immediately respond to the data , closing down five crowns at 1,055 on the Prague Stock Exchange.Based on IAS figures , the results were better than I expected ... I expected about nine billion crowns so its slightly higher , said Miroslav Nosal , an analyst at Patria Finance.I expect the shares will respond favourably to the results and the fact that CEZ said dividends will be suggested to the shareholders at the AGM , he added.CEZ officials have said several times that they would like to pay a dividend for 1996 , but Voboril admitted the firm 's majority shareholder , the state , may not be in favour of the move.A spokeswoman at the minstry of industry and trade , which manages the state 's 67 percent stake , told Reuters a final decision had yet to be made on whether the proposal would be approved.It 's early for a final position .
The ministry is considering the possibilities of dividend payments at CEZ and also the distribution companies , ministry spokeswoman Zuzana Fialova.In addition , Voboril said the company expects 1997 profits to fall to the level of six billion this year as write-offs will increase.He warned that the slow deregulation of energy prices and a less than desired price increase that CEZ may bill regional power distributors for electricity , as well as rising fuel prices and other costs , threatened to hit the company 's perfomance in the future.But he said that the company 's creation of internal sources has been on and upward trend thanks to higher write-offs , despite profits falling under Czech standards , which are the basis for taxation and dividend payments.Voboril said CEZ would tap international debt markets in the middle of this year with a bond issue , but declined to give more details.In the results statement , prepared under international accounting standards , operating revenues grew by 9.4 percent last year to 55.4 billion , while operating expenses were up by 17.3 percent.Earnings prior to tax fell 6.9 percent to 15.6 billion , but net profit rose due to a 20.8 percent decrease in tax payments , to 5.9 billion.The company managed to increase its market share to 80 percent from 77 percent in 1995 .
Earnings per share rose to 180 crowns from 173 , and return on equity fell to 10.4 percent from 11.1 percent.Voboril said CEZ invested 22.3 billion crowns last year , and commissioned equipment worth 25 billion , including two hydroelectric power plants. -- Prague Newsroom , 420-2-2423-0003 A plan on how the Czech Republic will diversify natural gas supplies , now coming solely from Russia , has been delayed for several weeks , the Industry and Trade Ministry said on Tuesday.We are gathering information , analysing it , and it 's going to take several weeks ( before the issue is put before the government ) , ministry spokesman Miroslav Konvalina said.A plan had been expected to be submitted to the government sometime in January .
Konvalina gave no reason for the delay.Officials have declined to say which partners the government was considering , though government representatives have held talks on limited deliveries from Norway.The ministry is drawing up plans for four options for securing gas supplies , but has given no details .
No matter which plan is accepted , Russia is expected to remain the dominant supplier.It said the four options being considered are : - Purchasing all natural gas from Gazprom , using two different shipping routes , with a long-term agreement until 2016 , with price guarantees until 1998.- Purchasing some Russian gas indirectly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV , and Germany 's Wintershall , a subsidiary of BASF AG .
Gasunie would start supplies in 1998 , delivering up to two billion cubic metres in 2005 , with the agreement lasting until 2014.In case of a fall in Russian supplies , it would deliver its own gas through Wingas , a joint venture of Wintershall ( 65 percent ) and Gazprom ( 35 percent ) .Wintershall offers a similar scheme , with deliveries starting on January 1 next year , rising to one billion cubic metres in 2000 , under a deal until 2016 .
Negotiations with these firms are in the stage of initiating a supply contract.- Finalising and maintaining the agreement for Norwegian gas , which was given preliminary approval this year , until 2017.- A limited purchase from Mobil Europe Gas Inc , Germany 's Brigitta Erdgas und Erdoel ( BEB ) and British Gas Plc .The Czechs have ended their dependance on Russian crude oil by building a new pipeline to Germany , but are still completely dependant on supplies provided by Russia 's Gazprom.The Czech Republic consumes around eight to nine billion cubic metres of natural gas per year , but volumes are expected to rise to some 12-13 billion cubic metres by the turn of the century. -- Prague Newsroom , 42-2-2423-0003 Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s. said on Thursday it had agreed with Czech steelmaker Trinecke Zelezarny a.s. to cooperate in steel production and privatisation projects.Skoda said the deal would help make the ailing Czech steel industry more efficient through coordinating the modernisation of production in complementary areas.Skoda , which makes heavy iron finished and semi-finished goods , said in a statement from its headquarters in Plzen that both companies would specialise and coordinate in unspecified areas of production , aiming to cut costs.Skoda 's spokesman Karel Samec said selected products would be manufactured in the cheaper of the two mills.This scheme will also be used in the future in other companies , Samec said in a statement .
Cooperation and ... participation in privatisation is necessary , bearing in mind the current stagnation of the steel production in the world.Samec declined to specify which privatisation projects Skoda had under consideration.The Industry and Trade Ministry plans to sell 19 percent stakes of the 67 percent it holds in two other steel firms -- Nova Hut a.s. and Vitkovice a.s.The plan has yet to be approved by the full cabinet.Trinecke Zelezarny , one of the four biggest steelmills located in the northeastern town of Trinec , was partially privatised through a direct sale of a 51 percent stake to a domestic investment group and the government 's voucher scheme.A steel industry source told Reuters on Thursday that Skoda , which has rapidly acquiried companies in the post-Communist era , was also considering acquiring the troubled Poldi Ocel steel mill west of Prague.Skoda 's Samec told Reuters he was not aware of any plans that would lead to Skoda acquisitions in Nova Hut or Vitkovice , and that it was too early to talk about other projects.The government in 1993 agreed to sell a controlling stake in Poldi to the small Czech company , Bohemia Art which has never fully paid for its majority interest.Production in Poldi came to a halt earlier this year because the company was not able to pay its energy bills.Skoda was involved in inconclusive talks earlier this year on bailing out Poldi .
Bankruptcy cases against Poldi are slowly moving through the courts.Skoda , based in the western city of Plzen , makes everything from drink cans to trolleybuses and nuclear components and has shown a large appetite for acquisitions .
It is no longer affiliated with the car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s. -- Prague Newsroom , 42-2-2423-0003 Opposition leader Milos Zeman urged the Czech parliament on Wednesday to approve a separate resolution to clarify his concerns about a post-World War Two reconciliation pact with Germany.But deputies in Zeman 's own Social Democratic party ( CSSD ) admitted that the votes were probably were still there to push the deal with Germany through parliament and save the Czech government from embarrassment.On the second day of debate on the declaration , which has already been signed by the Prague and Bonn governments and approved by the German parliament , Zeman demanded the accompanying rider.I would want to believe this parliament would find the courage to express itself on the declaration in its resolution , as the parliament of a sovereign state , he said.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 's three-party conservative coalition , which is two seats short of a majority in the lower house , has rejected any sort of extra resolution which may interpret the already-signed declaration.In the accord , Bonn expresses regret for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of Czech lands and Prague expresses sorrow for brutality in the post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans.The text also includes German support for Czech membership of the European Union ( EU ) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) .It skirts around the most sensitive issues of direct compensation for property seized from the expelled Germans.German politicians sympathetic to their families , who now mostly live in southern Germany , have said that the issue of individual compensation for property was still open , despite the inter-governmental declaration.Zeman said comments made by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl after he signed the document , and later by Finance Minister Theo Waigel , showed that Bonn considered the property problems still unresolved.These subsequent statements are the basic reason for my concern , he said.CSSD vice-chairman Karel Machovec said that while the additional resolution , which has yet to be presented , might help to ensure a larger majority for the declaration , the government probably had the votes to win.I know about three or four Social Democrats who would vote for the declaration , Machovec told Reuters , saying he would be among those voting for the deal.The debate in the Czech lower house looked set to last late into the week , with small opposition parties attempting filibusters and other procedural moves to block the declaration from coming to a vote.The ultra-right Republican Party and the Communist Party say the declaration lets Germany off lightly for Nazi attrocities and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia .
Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said on Thursday that a long-awaited Czech-German post-World War Two reconciliation treaty would not bring any change to laws which expelled millions of ethnic Germans.Zieleniec told reporters he welcomed German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 's statement on Wednesday that he hoped the sensitive document closing the book on the Nazi occupation of Czech lands and its aftermath would be signed by year 's end.But Zieleniec said there would be no tinkering with Prague 's post-war laws which expelled and expropriated over 2.5 million ethnic Germans , known as Sudeten Germans , after the Czech lands were liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945.I want to say something clearly : the declaration will not at all mean not even a hint of a change of the Czech legal order , said Zieleniec.I am glad Mr. Chancellor spoke on this issue , it is a sign Czech-German relations are an important part of German political activity at present , and that these relations are in the focus of Germany 's key politicians , he added.Intensive bilateral talks on the declaration , now running for more than a year , have been held amid calls by politically powerful groups repesenting the expelled Germans for compensation from Prague.The Czech government has given symbolic compensation to Czech victims of Nazi occupation , but the Bonn government has yet to offer compensation to the Czechs similar to payments made to victims of Nazism in other European countries.The expelled Germans ' groups , concentrated in southern Germany , have demanded the abolition of the post-war decrees issued by then-Czechoslovak President Edvard Benes.Attempts to cancel the decrees by some individuals through Czech courts have failed.Kohl pleaded for patience in his address to the Bundestag on Wednesday : We want to conclude this agreement this year , he said , adding that he wanted it to be symbolically crowned by a speech in Bonn by a representative of the Czech government.After a meeting with ministers on Thursday Czech President Vaclav Havel , who has spearheaded Prague 's warming of relations with Bonn despite holding a mostly ceremonial position , said he agreed with Kohl.There 's nothing left but to say that it is good that Mr. Chancellor ( Kohl ) would like to have the declaration signed by the end of the year .
Pope John Paul arrived in Prague on Friday , saying he hoped his visit to the Czech Republic would bring a new step forward in the spiritual growth of all Czechs.The 76-year old Pontiff , on his third visit to Prague since the fall of communism in 1989 , was greeted at the airport by President Vaclav Havel and other Czech political and religious leaders.Some 200 schoolchildren waved yellow and white Vatican flags as the Pope slowly descended the aircraft steps and shook Havel 's hand before touching a bowl of Czech earth.Pope John Paul said in a speech he hoped his visit would help bring about a fresh step forward in the ever-increasing spiritual and ethical growth of all Czechs.He paid tribute to Havel , a former dissident playwright who spent several years in jail under communism , as being among those who brought about the rebirth of this country.The Pope is in the Czech Republic chiefly to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the death of St Adalbert , the first Czech bishop who also took the gospel to Poland.Adalbert , or Vojtech in Czech , is seen by Catholics as a figure of spiritual significance for Europeans of all denominations.I am certain that the heritage of Christian values of which St Adalbert was a special witness in times marked by ignorance and cruelty will not leave indifferent those who , although far from belief , have at heart the civil , cultural and spiritual roots which have so profoundly marked the history of your homeland , the Pope said.He also paid tribute to late Czech Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek , who for 40 years championed religious freedom in communist Czechoslovakia and died in 1992.He will certainly be rejoicing in heaven to see me return among his people ... History is truly guided by the almighty hand of God , he said.Havel said in his speech that Adalbert cherished a dream of European spiritual unity and saw his Czech homeland as part of the Christian community of the continent.This community was to be based on a spiritual and moral renewal and on readiness to embrace common values -- which is needed today just as it was then , Havel said.The president said the martyred saint had left a legacy of peace , integration and unity which was shared by the many European nations commemorating his millennium.The Pope 's last visit to the Czech Republic , in May 1995 , proved controversial when he canonised Jan Sarkander , tortured to death by Protestants in 1620 .
Some Protestants say Sarkander was a traitor who encouraged a Catholic invasion.But Havel said Adalbert 's tradition did not divide Czechs among themselves or with others.It unites our people across denominations and serves as a bridge linking us with our Central European neighbours as well as with other nations , he said.The Pope , whose health has been fragile in recent years , walked slowly but unassisted and stood to deliver his speech.He is to mark Adalbert 's death with a mass for young people in the town of Hradec Kralove , some 100 km ( 60 miles ) from Prague , on Saturday and hold another open air mass and an ecumenical service in the capital on Sunday .
The lower house of the Czech parliament ended four days of acrimonious debate on Friday by approving a post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany already signed by both governments.The parliamentary statement of approval for the declaration -- which includes a separate clause implying , in part , that post-war property restitution questions against the Czechs are closed -- was carried by 131 votes to 59.Germany 's parliament had already approved the declaration in January by a large majority.The Czech debate over the sensitive agreement turned ugly at times amid stalling tactics by ultra-right Republican and Communist opposition deputies who see the pact as a sellout to Bonn , and who were trying to obstruct a final vote.Approval of the declaration , expected to pass easily in the Czech upper house , is seen by the Prague government as a prerequisite for NATO and EU membership.The pact also seals Germany 's final post-war reconciliation with a neighbouring country.The agreement expresses Bonn 's regrets for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands , and Prague 's sorrow for Czech brutality in the post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans.While the bilateral agreement sets up a fund for general victim compensation programmes , it does not directly deal with the thorny issue of restitution to expropriated ethnic Germans .
Instead it says the issue should never again become a political consideration.The parliamentary preamble approved with the declaration makes reference to speeches by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec introducing the measure this week in which both insist that post-war property restitution questions are closed.Bonn insisted after the agreement was signed that individual property claims can still be made , but Klaus and Zieleniec both rejected this.The largest opposition party , the Social Democrats ( CSSD ) , demanded that references to the introductory speeches by Klaus and Zieleniec be included in the preamble -- especially because of their comments on property issues -- to ensure a large majority in favour of the declaration.The preamble says simply that parliament , after listening to the prime minister ... and foreign minister , and on the basis of the government 's reasoning , agrees with the declaration which expresses the will of both states to prevent the past from troubling the joint European future.Zieleniec said after the vote ( corrects from after the speech ) that the preamble , which may raise eyebrows in southern Germany where most of the expellees now live , was not aimed at any specific issue , despite the CSSD 's protests.It is a formulation which does not interpret the declaration nor does it stress any of its parts above others , Zieleniec said.Top German politicians had cautioned the Czech parliament not to reinterpret the pact , which took nearly two years to negotiate .
U.S.-based Unisys Corp said on Tuesday it has appealed to the Czech Economic Competition Office a Defence Ministry decision awarding an army contract to a consortium of Electronic Data Systems and Digital Equipment Corp.Unisys submitted ... a proposal for investigation of the decision of the Defence Minister of the Czech Republic , the company said in a statement.Last week , Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny rejected a first round appeal by Unisys and IBM Corp saying he believed his decision in March to award a 1.3 billion crown army information system deal to EDS-Digital was correct.Vyborny chose EDS-Digital despite a recommendation by a steering committee to chose Unisys 's bid.By this step ( the appeal ) , Unisys is continuing in its effort for recognition of its victory in the public tender ... because it is convinced of the seriousness of its arguments , the statement said.Vyborny has said that he decided in favour of EDS-Digital due to the lower price of its bid .
Unisys has said that price was not weighted in accordance with the tender rules , and that EDS-Digital 's offer was not complete .
EDS declined to comment.Unisys won an original four billion crown supply tender last year , but it was cancelled in August when competition authorities found irregularities in the process.Vyborny said after the second tender that the ministry had decided to ignore the recommendation of the tender committee also because some members 's evaluations were far different than the rest of the committee.Unisys has said it was suspicious that the original tender was abolished and rankings were changed when it won again.Unisys is proposing cancellation of the decision and hopes the government of the Czech Republic will deal with the situation around this strategic order , Unisys added.A number of other Czech military tenders have been marked by controversy , sometimes including allegations of graft.Installation of the staff information system is seen as a large step on the Czech army 's path to compatibility with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 's military command.NATO leaders will decide in July which former communist countries will be invited to join the alliance .
The Czech Republic is a front runner along with Poland and Hungary. -- Prague Newsroom , 420-2-2423-0003 Czech power utility CEZ a.s. on Wednesday reported lower first half profits as the effects of a prolonged battle over price agreements with regional distributors took a bite out of its bottom line.Despite an unusually long winter that boosted first half revenues , company officials told a news conference that net profit , according to international accounting standards , eased to 5.95 billion crowns from 6.26 billion in the previous year.They added the firm 's net profit calculated according to Czech accounting standards fell year-on-year to 5.1 billion in the first half from 5.57 billion crowns.CEZ , the country 's largest firm in terms of revenues , and six out of the country 's eight regional power distributors have been at odds for months over the terms of long-term supply agreements , and have been fighting over prices since last year.CEZ 's Petr Voboril said that in the first quarter , CEZ charged 1,020 crowns and last year 's average price of 1,033 crowns per megawatthour as deposit payments in the second quarter while the agreements are sorted out , but even that was n't enough to keep profits from slipping.Most of the distributors do not even pay the full provisional price .
At the end of the first half they owed us almost two billion crowns , said Voboril , director of CEZ 's planning and financial analysis department.He told reporters that the drop would have been sharper if it was not partially covered by higher-than-planned energy sales due to the long winter.CEZ operating revenues , according to international standards , rose to 28.51 billion crowns from 26.09 billion as the company raised its market share to 79.8 percent from 76.3 percent.The firm still plans to post flat profit for the entire year , and to pay its first-ever dividend of 3.3 percent of the 1,000 crown nominal value of its shares , Voboril said.CEZ posted an international standard 9.3 billion crown 1995 net profit , and an 8.1 billion crown Czech accounting net profit.Until this year , CEZ has re-invested all earnings into its extensive desulphurisation programme and the construction of a nuclear power plant at Temelin.CEZ shares dipped two crowns on the Prague Stock Exchange on Wednesday to 1,043 crowns , with most analysts saying the market had already discounted the lower profit figure.But warned Jan Sykora , a broker with Prague 's Wood and Company : There are still many unclear things .
CEZ , despite the increase of market share , will rather lose its positions. -- Prague Newsroom , 42-2-2423-0003 The Czech government announced a sweeping series of economic measures to jump start the economy on Wednesday , but admitted that even with the moves , GDP growth would slump badly in 1997.In releasing the 11 page plan late Wednesday afternoon , Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said cuts of almost five percent to budget expenditures , limits on public sector wage growth and a speeding up of privatisation would affect almost every Czech.He said the measures are aimed not only at improving the economy , but also the completion of the concept of the transformation of the Czech economy.Therefore it must be a very complex combination of individual measures , but also of explicit change of the original objectives of the government 's policy , he said.But Klaus told reporters that even with the measures , he would consider it a success if 1997 GDP growth reached half of the 5.4 percent , year-on-year growth rate forecast in the budget.While the statement said monetary policy was not mentioned in the document because this area is for the central bank to decide , it nonetheless chided the central bank for its tight monetary policy.There must be an inverse development in monetary and fiscal policy , the statement said .
Monetary policy , after the restriction in middle of the last year ... ( it ) must make a move in the opposite direction , it said.Added Klaus : There is an argument ... That the state does not consider it rational to strive to alter the exchange rate .
We are not altering the central parity of the crown and we are convinced that the fluctuation band plus and minus 7.5 per cent is fully sufficient.The crown is fixed daily by the central bank at +/- 7.5 percent of the mid-point of its dollar/mark basket.The Czech economy has enjoyed several years of demand-led growth as industry imported technology and a sharp rise in wages provoked a consumer boom.But industrial and construction output have both declined for two consecutive months and the burgeoning trade deficit , at a record 160.3 billion crowns in 1996 , has shown no signs of letting up.The government measures include : *Some 25.5 billion crowns cuts in budget expenditure , originally approved at 549.1 billion crowns .
*A limiting of public sector wage growth to 7.3 percent , from an originally-planned 11.9 percent .
*A speeding up of privatisation , including banks .
*Tightening of capital market regulation , including the setting up of an independent watchdog and the separation of investment and commercial banking .
*Implementation of an import deposit programme forcing importers to place a still to be determined percent of the value of imports on interest-free deposit at the central bank.The government also said it would propose a lowering of the corporate tax rate in 1998 to 35 percent from 39 percent this year , but some excise taxes would rise to help boost revenues .
Copper and zinc were the main focus of attention for Far East metal traders on Monday , though China 's exit from the market to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Ox left a gaping hole in trading activity.China has closed down to celebrate the arrival of the new lunar year .
Most Chinese markets will be closed until February 17 , though trading activity should start to pick up mid-week.A slight fundamental tightness in copper supply was seen throughout the region , a trader in Singapore told Reuters , adding that it was not being helped by high cash prices.Even in mainland China we understand people are having difficulty in obtaining metal , he said .
Obviously the high cash price is somewhat of a deterrent but if they need physical metal they just have to buy it.Three months copper on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) ended the Friday afternoon kerb at $ 2,239 a tonne , after profit-taking trimmed $ 18 off Thursday 's closing price.Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.Chinese media reported last month that China 's 1997 copper demand should rise five percent over last year to 1.05 million tonnes .
Output is expected to be more than 900,000 tonnes , after 1996 's 909,700 tonnes , Market Daily said.Copper imports were expected to remain high , the newspaper said .
Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes.The few trading sources available on Monday said end-users of the red metal in Asia were buying hand-to-mouth , but there was as yet no element of panic-buying.If you start to see some significant increase in demand , then I think that 's where the market will have some interest via higher prices , one trader said.Zinc enters the Year of the Ox as a bull for Asian traders , some of whom thought recent rallies that have seen LME prices touch two-year highs could be more in anticipation of upcoming tightness than a reflection of current fundamentals.LME zinc hit a fresh two-year high of $ 1,196 a tonne in early Friday trading , ending the day $ 3 easier at $ 1,183 a tonne.What one Asian trader described as the magical and psychological level of $ 1,200 a tonne is the metal 's next test , followed by the January 1995 peak of $ 1,239.Traders ' optimism that current price levels would consolidate before true tightness hit the market in the second half of 1997 were being fuelled by this year 's shortfall in global supply of up to 250,000 tonnes , they said.Lack of Chinese activity in the zinc market during the holiday period was not seen by trading sources as impacting on price movements one way or the other.But word that Chinese producers had already moved 20,000 tonnes of zinc to Singapore warehouses , and that another 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes was on the way , was indicative of their selling interest , traders said.I 'm not sure that there is any interest in immediately selling it but they ( Chinese producers ) are moving it very close to a market where they can sell it , deliver it and get cash in two days , another Singapore source said.Chinese metal producers often moved their product to Singapore , keeping it off-warrant so it does not show up in LME stock reports but where it can be used as collateral , he said.If the market remained strong , Chinese zinc could stay put as producers waited for prices to rise even further , he said.If they hold off on the anticipation of higher prices , it is just a gamble , and how quickly they sell into a retracement is difficult to know -- but they certainly do n't appear to be overly concerned at present , he said.The latest Hong Kong/Shanghai indications of premium or discount in US $ /tonne over LME cash prices on a CIF basis : Feb 10 Feb 3 COPPER N/A 70ALUMINIUM ( Western ) N/A 100 ( CIS ) N/A 75 LEAD N/A ( FOB Chinese ports ) N/A 10 ZINC ( Chinese ) 70 ( Chinese unregistered , FOB Shanghai ) N/A -25-30 ( Western ) 110-120 N/A ( Western alloys ) N/A N/A ( $ 1=8.3 yuan ) The jump in London Metal Exchange ( LME ) zinc prices to a 4-1/2 year high , as yet , threatens no flood of Chinese metal onto the market , but producers are sitting on a windfall , traders said on Monday.The main flow of Chinese zinc exports is currently headed for Japan attracted by its preferential duty free policy for metal imports from developing countries up until April 1 , a trader with a European firm in Hong Kong said.Chinese zinc is very tight otherwise and you wo n't see any indications for a while , she said .
LME three-month zinc touched a 4-1/2 year high of $ 1,266 a tonne on Friday , before a slight fall back to close at $ 1,254 , up $ 12.Far East metal traders and producer representatives in the region agreed the metal has yet to hit its peak , with some expecting a consolidation around $ 1,240 and others predicting a push towards $ 1,350 before a consolidation.Official China customs figures show China 's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in January , 1997 reached 30,914 tonnes , up 100.3 percent compared to the year-ago period .
Exports were boosted by high LME prices and a reduction in a Chinese export tax on the metal from five percent in 1996 to nil this year , boosting the value of domestic zinc by $ 50 a tonne.This year should be an historic year for Chinese zinc metal exports -- if the price stays high , a Beijing dealer said.He said he believed total Chinese zinc exports would hit 80,000 tonnes for January and February 1997 , and possibly half a million tonnes for the whole year.China exported a total of 226,777 tonnes of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in 1996 , up 18.4 percent on 1995 , the customs figures show .
But an executive with a Western producer that supplies to the region said he had so far seen no evidence of increased Chinese zinc sales to the Asian market.The supply and demand fundamentals on physical metal are improving as far as expectations of price hikes and continued support go , he said .
This would see prices firm further.I am telling my customers that it is best for them to place their orders as soon as possible , as the trend is rising and we do n't know where it will go , the representative for a major North American producer said .
LME zinc could probably move up at least another $ 100 a tonne and this would see premiums start to soften as producers and sellers tried to compete , he said.Traders pegged current CIF special high grade zinc premiums in Hong Kong at $ 130 a tonne over the LME cash price and high grade at $ 120 a tonne.The Beijing trader said Chinese smetlers were selling at a $ 40 premium FOB Chinese ports .
High grade was selling at a discount of $ 25 a tonne , he said .
I think LME zinc will be volatile , he said .
Some people were saying last year they thought it would go to $ 1,400 but I would n't be so bullish.The latest Hong Kong indications of premium or discount in US $ /tonne over LME cash prices on a CIF basis : March 10 March 3 Copper , cathode 75 75 Aluminium , 99.7 ingot 180 180 Lead , Chinese 60 60 Zinc , SHG 99.995 ingots 100-130 25 -- Shanghai newsroom ( 86-21 ) 6279-8544 Up to one million tonnes of soybean meal is clogging Chinese ports , filling warehouses and forcing domestic prices down , traders said on Wednesday.There is no demand , said one U.S. trader.Of the million tonnes estimated to be sitting in Chinese ports , either on ships or in warehouses , 400,000 tonnes is in southern Guangdong , one source said.The market has dropped and the buyers are stuck with the meal , the source said.Feed mills were buying on a hand-to-mouth basis , keeping minimum stocks and hoping to squeeze desperate importers on the price , said a trader in Shanghai.When they find all the port stocks are consumed , they will start increasing their buying -- but that wo n't be for a while and who knows when , he said.Traders polled by Reuters varied in their view of just when the stocks would dwindle to a point that will inspire buying -- the optimists said late February , the pessimists plumbed for as late as July.In the meantime , the domestic Chinese price of soybean meal has plunged around 10 percent in the past six weeks , traders said , from 2,900-2,950 yuan ( $ 349-355 ) a tonne , to 2,650-2,750 yuan ( $ 319-331 ) a tonne now.Soybean meal prices on the Chicago Board of Trade ( CBOT ) ended mostly firm on Tuesday , closing $ 2.40 per tonne higher to 30 cents lower , with March up $ 1.40 to $ 238.10 per tonne.Thai traders reported on Tuesday that Chinese buyers of Indian-origin soybean meal had defaulted on some cargoes because the market could not absorb the huge quantities on the way.China 's soybean meal arrivals in the last quarter of 1996 were between one and 1.2 million tonnes , traders said , with loading and shipping delays pushing back the landing time of large quantities from South America and the United States.Our vessels with an ETA ( estimated time of arrival ) around mid-December all arrived in January , said the Shanghai source.Another said his company currently had vessels in four or five Chinese ports awaiting discharge and facing demurrage charges.A trading source in Singapore said 250,000 tonnes of meal was due to arrive and/or discharge at Chinese ports this month.On top of that , 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes of soybeans would be discharged in China before the Lunar New Year vacation begins on February 6 , he said.It will be interesting to see how all this is absorbed by the market , another trading source said.Overbuying in 1996 and delayed arrivals were compounded by a decision in December by Heilongjiang province to allow the sale of unprocessed soybeans to other parts of the country for the first time in more than three years.Heilongjiang , in the far northeast , is China 's biggest soybean producer , with 1996 output estimated at 4.135 million tonnes , down slightly from 1995.While prices in the province had suffered from the moratorium , the decision to lift the non-value-added sales ban had had little impact on farmers ' prices , the U.S. source said.The Shanghai trader , however , said that fundamental demand in China for beans as food , rather than feed , kept prices steady.In Shanghai now , prices are 3,000 yuan ( per tonne ) for beans , and of that 2,600 goes back to Heilongjiang .
That 's not bad , he said .
China is unlikely to take delivery of Thai sugar bought in the past month because import licences have not been issued to Chinese buyers and local prices are too low to make imports viable , traders said on Wednesday.People got excited , but China is not importing sugar , a trader with a big U.S. house in Hong Kong said.Sugar can not be imported to China without a licence.There are no import licences at all being issued , it is all in the hands of ( Beijing 's central food trading arm ) Ceroils .
Prices are still pretty low , so I do n't see any movement on imports , the bank source said from Hong Kong.Since February , China has reportedly bought four cargoes of Thai raw sugar for tolling , or processing and re-exporting , traders said.But a trader with a European bank said the Chinese purchases had been overstated by two-thirds and in fact stood at 25,000 tonnes bought on licence.The licence had been issued to the local government in China 's Himalayan region of Tibet.Other traders also had mentioned the Tibetan import licence for 25,000 tonnes of sugar , issued in order to allow the government of the impoverished region to sell the commodity on the local market and make some money .
This could not be officially confirmed.Thai raw sugar premiums have firmed recently on the news of China 's purchases , and traders throughout the region were caught out , having predicted China would not import sugar until the second half of 1997 when traditional market shortages would begin to bite.Far East traders had said they did not expect to see China buying sugar on the international market before then .
Some sources questioned whether China would import at all this year.Recent buying by central authorities from Guangxi , China 's major production area , would have boosted central government reserves , probably to about 10 percent of annual consumption , or 700,000 tonnes , one trading source said.This could be released onto the market if prices , currently around 3,900 yuan per tonne , go up to 4,500 yuan which is unlikely before August/September , he said.Some industry sources were sounding smug on Wednesday , having done their sums and seen that even importing at good prices was not an economical option for Chinese buyers currently.Imported sugar is subject to 12 percent import duty and 17 percent value-added tax , which would be added to the cost of the Thai raws of $ 250 a tonne , plus a $ 30 a tonne premium , the trading source said.Processing would push cost per tonne to above 4,000 yuan in a climate where market prices are below that , the head of a joint venture processor in Gaungxi said.If they can import and toll and sell for 4,200 then they can buy back some sugar at the current levels and then they can still make a margin and a little profit , he said.But at the moment , the price is not high , so how can they make money ?
he said.With the sugar cane crushing season in full swing , Chinese markets are flush with processed sugar and prices have been soft for some months.Wholesale sugar prices in the southern growing regions have yet to reach break-even levels for the factories , the Guangxi joint venture manager said.Ex-factory prices in Gaungxi were seen at 3,950-3,980 yuan ( $ 476-469 ) per tonne .
Break-even is above 4,000 yuan.There is an upward trend and hope is on the horizon , the manager said , adding he expected sugar prices to move to 4,000-4,100 yuan ( $ 482-494 ) a tonne within the next 30 days.Prices were likely to stabilise at that level before shortages kicked in around August and September , he said .
( $ 1 = 8.3 yuan ) Indium , one of the few minor metals to survive the end of the Cold War with demand intact , is now in short supply as Chinese producers have either oversold or are hoarding stocks as prices soar , traders said on Friday.Traders in China and Japan , the world 's biggest consumer of indium , said Chinese producers seemed unwilling to sell at current prices , instead waiting for further rises.Indium , a by-product of zinc , is used in the manufacture of semi-conductors and liquid crystal displays ( LCD ) .China is Asia 's biggest producer , according to one trading source.Japan uses about two-thirds of annual world supply , with 80 percent of that used to make LCDs , a Tokyo market source said.Japanese consumption slumped 38 percent in 1996 to 43.5 tonnes , pressuring on prices , he said.But with an improved economic outlook and a revival in the high-end electronics industry , indium demand is picking up and world supply is tightening.Figures for China 's annual output are not available .
One trader said it is not a major world supplier of indium but in a tight market its output counted.Chinese producers have sold out , in effect they have oversold , so I do n't think we will see anything available before late April/early May , a Chinese trader in Beijing said.Chinese producers are now looking for $ 290 a kg , on a free-on-board ( FOB ) basis , he said.The price for 99.99 percent indium ingot was quoted in Rotterdam last week at $ 220/250 a kg.Chinese indium is arriving in Japan at $ 280-300 a kg , inclusive of cost , insurance and freight ( CIF ) , the Tokyo trader said.Far East traders said they have been waiting for spot prices for indium to hit $ 300 a kg , as there was no perceptible pickup in Chinese production after the Lunar New Year holiday in February.A European source in Hong Kong said he recently bought a few hundred kg of indium in the belief that prices are on their way back up to the levels of two years ago , close to $ 500 a kg.The market has seen those levels before and is not afraid of them , he said.The Chinese trading source said that Chinese factories were now shipping against old contracts but were asking for a premium over the contracted price.Other traders said long-term contracts were being delayed , with some reporting that Chinese suppliers were attempting to re-negotiate prices.Some suppliers were also reneging , they said.We have had that experience , a source at a Western company said.So in this atmosphere people are very wary and we are still pushing for our own deliveries , he said.Another Chinese trader said there were sources of indium in China and Hong Kong but these were unlikely to seep into the market until prices firmed more dramatically.When the price rose to $ 400-500 a kg in 1995 , a lot of Chinese companies were thinking it would go as high as $ 700 and they bought a lot of material at $ 400 , the source said.Some of them are still holding , waiting for the price to go up again so they can clear their books , he said.So there is material and we will see some come out but there wo n't be a flood because producers have oversold , they will want to clear their old contracts first.In the meantime , there are a lot of people knocking on our door looking for indium , he said .
China has missed a golden opportunity to export corn and earn millions of dollars , and now has up to a million tonnes of the grain rotting in silos in the country 's north , Far East traders said on Tuesday.This year is going to be a major disaster , a Hong Kong trader said.All that corn sitting in Dalian is just rotting , he said , adding his estimate that 500,000 to one million tonnes of corn was stored in northern silos in anticipation of exports .
Corn , grown predominantly in China 's far northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang , Jilin and Liaoning , began moving to northern ports , particularly Dalian , around May , traders said.People had geared up for a huge export programme and I think the traditional northeast suppliers anticipated two million tonnes being permissioned for export , a trader in Singapore said.Concern about national food security and the impact on domestic prices that exports would have in an atmosphere of acute inflationary paranoia had kept China out of the world corn market , trading sources said .
Corn and rice exports were banned in December 1994 after stocks fell to frighteningly low levels in a country where the governing Communist Party bases much of its ruling mandate on availability and affordability of staple foods.Imports soon began , totalling 5.18 million tonnes in 1995 .
Corn imports in the first five months of 1996 were 400,000 tonnes , customs figures show.Expectations began building in April that China 's central grain authorities would allow corn exports to take advantage of high world prices and also to ease a local surplus and push up softening domestic prices .
Prices had dropped below $ 120 a tonne in some areas.Word at the time from traders involved in negotiations with China 's central grain reserve on what nature the exports should take -- barter or cash -- was that the corn would be sold mostly to Japan and South Korea at around $ 180 a tonne.There was a stage when they could have got $ 180 , and from the inverse they could have picked up $ 20 a tonne selling FOB ( free on board ) and picking up from the U.S. six months later , the Singapore trader said .
They missed a big opportunity .
The company was applying for the right to import and export corn in order to solve the problem of huge corn stockpiles , an official of the company said.Official figures put 1995 corn production at 101 million tonnes .
Output in 1996 has been projected by media to hit 112 million tonnes .
Annual demand is 100-115 million tonnes.Traders and grain industry sources have said China 's total corn reserves are up to 30 million tonnes .
A few hundred thousand tonnes of Chinese corn was sold to Japan , South Korea , Indonesia and Malaysia , or bartered for equipment supplied by Japanese food processing corporations as part of joint-venture deals , industry sources said.China 's government , however , remained adamant that the export ban had not been lifted.Officials of the newly-established Jilin Grain Group , set up by the Jilin provincial government and opened for business on Monday , told Reuters the province had its biggest stockpile in history , some three million tonnes .
Traders said that while owners of the corn stocked at northern ports such as Dalian , Yingkou and Qinghuangdao had lost money on transport , storage and deterioration , the grain was now slowly being absorbed back into the domestic market. -- Hong Kong newsroom ( 852 ) 2843-6470 Sky-high world copper prices do not seem to be supported by fundamentals and could soon be in for a liquidation-related correction , Chinese copper trading sources said on Monday.I do n't really see any support for $ 2,400 , a Chinese source on the Shanghai Metal Exchange ( SME ) said.If the price can go above $ 2,400 a tonne and stay up there for a decent period , that would indicate some support , he said .
But I think the funds are under pressure to sell.London Metal Exchange ( LME ) copper came under heavy pressure from liquidation and end-week sales on Friday after surging to a nine-month high of $ 2,445 a tonne.The market fell back to close Friday 's kerb at $ 2,390 , a $ 13 fall on Thursday 's close.Shanghai copper futures ended down across the board on Monday on heavy profit-taking , with the most active June 1997 contract ending at 23,370 yuan ( $ 2,817 ) , losing 50 yuan.Traders said the correction came on the back of the LME 's Friday falls.The SME trading source said he would sell at 23,300 yuan per tonne .
Monday 's intra-day low was 23,200 yuan and he saw it going down further this week to 22,800.LME copper appeared set to test the downside on Monday , with the first support level at $ 2,350 , London analysts said.This had the support of Chinese traders , one of whom said from the southern Zhuhai Special Economic Zone that LME copper prices should consolidate around $ 2,320-2,380.He and others ruled out Chinese activity in the immediate term , saying prices were still too high to justify buying.The official China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday that China 's demand for copper would reach 1.2 million tonnes in 1997.China 's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes , up 5.71 percent on 1995 , according to State Statistical Bureau figures.Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.Copper imports are expected to remain high , media reports have said .
Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes .
-- Shanghai newsroom ( 86-21 ) 6279-8544 China has set realistic targets in its 1997 budget but analysts said on Sunday that debt-ridden state-owned enterprises and high unemployment remain thorns in the government 's side.A 1997 budget deficit target of 57 billion yuan ( $ 6.87 billion ) , was , at less than one percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a very healthy level and good for a developing country , said Hoong Yik-Luen , head of China research at ING-Barings.Finance Minister Liu Zhongli , in his budget report on Sunday , announced a 7.2 percent cut in the budget deficit from 61.442 billion yuan in 1996 , which was itself 10.8 percent below target.Very few countries in the world today have a budget deficit around one percent of GDP , Hoong said.If you look at the United States , it is probably three to four percent , so they ( China ) are doing better in terms of budget deficit control than a lot of First World countries , he said.The government 's use of domestic bond issues was a clever and thoughtful way of soaking up China 's surplus cash for domestic investment , he said.China issued a total of 196.742 billion yuan in debt last year , 1.485 billion yuan above the targeted figure and an increase of 27 percent over 1995.The 1997 target for domestic and overseas debt announced by Finance Minister Liu is 248.596 billion yuan ( $ 29.95 billion ) , up 27.3 percent on the 1996 figure.One analyst in Shanghai said government authorities are realising there is a lot of money domestically as bank deposits far outstripped bank loans.By issuing domestic bonds -- though minute in value compared to developed countries that issue domestic and international debt -- the government was able to soak liquidity back into the system.If you look at the fact that all the bond issues were sold to domestic investors , then basically it is not an external debt problem , Hoong said.It is actually recycling domestic savings and moving the money from people 's hands , preventing them from spending and thereby accelerating inflation , and bringing that money back to the government , he said .
Then the government relies on domestic savings to invest domestically.Another analyst in Shanghai said one reason for the popularity of bonds was the lack of investment alternatives.One of the reasons that bank savings outstrip loans is because there is a lot of money in the system and people want to get some kind of return on it , she said.The other problem is that the lending rate is too low .
The banks could be lending a lot more than they are and they could be doing it very productively if they were allowed to do their own lending , she said.This was due in part to China 's tight credit policy of the past few years , she said .
While credit would probably be eased in 1997 , bank deregulation was not on Beijing 's agenda , she said.Stability , however , was a top government priority , especially after the death last month of Deng Xiaoping , whose 18-year leadership steered China from Stalinist backwater to economic powerhouse , analysts said.After three years of belt-tightening aimed at slowing growth that threatened to spin out of control , China should now be concentrating on such pillars as infrastructure development to create jobs and kick-start the sluggish economy , they said.China 's estimated 100,000 state firms reported their first ever combined net loss in the first quarter of last year , but a banking source said the economy 's reliance on them has fallen from 100 percent before 1979 to around 40 percent now.The need to retrench up to 150 million people had been factored into the government 's long-term economic policies , he said , and for the sake of stability could not be done overnight.It has to be done slowly , another of the bank analysts said .
And we would prefer it to be slow because if it is too hasty it could result in some very unproductive mergers.She and others put real national unemployment at close to 15 percent.The 1997 target for urban unemployment unveiled in Sunday 's budget was three percent .
China 's official urban unemployment rate was 2.9 percent at the end of the third quarter of 1996 , with no figure available for all of 1996 .
Officials have said the figure could be around seven percent.An inflation target of six percent for 1997 was realistic and achievable after 1996 's 6.1 percent , Hoong of ING-Barings said.They have shown they feel comfortable with the inflation rate , he said .
The question now is stability and stability will come if everyone has a job .
Far East metal traders said on Tuesday they were resigned to seeing China steer clear of major copper purchases before the end of April , when the country 's high consumption season begins.Now is not the right time of year , I think more towards the later part of this month because that 's when the season starts , said the head of a trading house in Hong Kong with smelting and refining interests in China.Small parcel purchases of 500 to 2,000 tonnes at a time by end-users continued , he and other traders said , as they had run down inventory and had no choice but to pay current high prices.The price of copper on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) has been hovering around $ 2,300 a tonne for the past couple of months , as the market waits for China 's annual buying programme to begin.LME copper finished the afternoon kerb last Thursday , ahead of the Easter holiday , at $ 2,372 a tonne.China 's peak season coincides with the end of winter , as construction projects gear up.China is producing healthy amounts of cathode from its own sufficient supplies of concentrate , a trader in Beijing said .
For a short period of time , domestic production should be able to support demand.Shanghai Metal Exchange figures show 14,828 tonnes of copper held on warrant in exchange warehouses , which local trading sources have said would be sufficient supply for two months.Attention has focused on zinc , as Japan 's window of tariff-free import opportunity from designated developing countries under its General System of Preferences ( GSP ) closed on March 31.Brokerage house Brandeis said last week GSP imports of zinc were expected to reach 90,000-100,000 tonnes , compared to 84,000 tonnes last year .
About 70,000 tonnes of that zinc would come from China , Brandeis said , up from 49,000 tonnes last year on expectations of higher world zinc prices spurring higher exports.Zinc prices on the LME have hovered around 4-1/2-year highs of $ 1,300 a tonne for the past few weeks , with many trading sources in the region confident of seeing prices touch $ 1,400 in the foreseeable future.Zinc closed on the LME on Thursday at $ 1,295 a tonne.A trader in Beijing said he expected LME zinc to correct downwards in the short term before bouncing back above $ 1,300 a tonne.After that I think there will be a consolidation and we could see the price move above $ 1,400 even in the first half of the year , he said.He and other sources in the region said China has begun to move substantial quantities of zinc to LME warehouses in Singapore , with estimates of 20,000-25,000 tonnes on the way.China 's major smelter , Huludao in the northeastern province of Liaoning , was producing 10,000 tonnes of special high grade zinc ingots a month despite annual capacity of 330,000 tonnes , a Chinese industry source said.Technical problems were keeping production of high quality exportable ingots down , he said.The goal is to do as much special high grade as possible but there are problems with the wet electrolytic process that mean they can not clean the liquid properly and the impurities are higher than they should be for special high grade , he said.Sources at China 's other major smelter , Zhuzhou in Hunan province , and at one of its trading representatives in Hong Kong have said it plans to gear up production to take advantage of the high world prices.Chinese producers are also known to move zinc to Singapore to use as collateral for bank loans .
In this case it does not necessarily appear on LME warrants , traders said .
Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) , which have reached a nine-month high , are not supported by fundamentals and can not last , a private Chinese base metals consultancy said on Thursday.We believe that worldwide copper fundamentals do not support the copper price rises , that any rises in the copper price will be shortlived and that 1997 will see a bearish market for copper , the Shanghai Colub Consultant Co said in a report.Analyst Rudolf Wolff , in an evening metal report , said that with little producer selling on Wednesday , it seemed any further buying could easily push the copper price towards its $ 2,400- $ 2,450 technical target.LME copper reached a fresh nine-month high of $ 2,415 a tonne at 1900 GMT on Wednesday , after a kerb level of $ 2,392 a tonne , up $ 42 on the day.But the report said although the charts remained bullish , the fundamentals were not.Shanghai Colub Consultant Co 's managing director Yen Zheng agreed , saying his company was more interested in market fundamentals than technical analysis.In its internal report , a copy of which was provided to Reuters , Shanghai Colub says an increase in worldwide copper output in 1996 should continue into 1997 , quickly turning the market from shortage to oversupply.New technology was constantly lowering production costs , the report said , with the 1996 average worldwide production cost of 67.8 U.S. cents a lb likely to fall to 60.7 cents a lb in 1997.If the copper price hit 110 cents a lb , profit margins would stretch to 81.2 percent and hedging opportunities would widen , the report said.The level of LME copper stocks affected the price more than other stocks , such as those held by producers and end-users , the report said .
It cited the effect that the irrationally low LME stock level of 90,000 tonnes at the end of 1996 had in pushing up prices.Copper prices had a roller-coaster ride in 1996 .
They plummeted to a 2-1/2-year low of $ 1,745 a tonne in June , when Japan 's Sumitomo Corp revealed massive trading losses , from a high for the year just a month earlier of $ 2,715 a tonne.But tight global supply and low stocks saw LME copper prices claw their way back , to start 1997 at $ 2,167 a tonne.With prices now around $ 2,400 a tonne , the Shanghai Colub report points to the current large stocks of copper held in LME warehouses and concludes that stocks will continue to rise , pushing values down.Recently , LME copper stocks have risen to around 222,000 tonnes , and while they will move around this level , the trend for stock increases will not change and will very quickly rise to 270,000 tonnes , the report said .
This is one reason the LME copper price will fall.LME warehouses now hold 222,050 tonnes of copper , after a slight fall earlier this week of 2,450 tonnes.China 's influence on the world market was also significant because the country was a major copper user , the report said.In 1996 , China produced 910,000 tonnes of refined copper , importing 300,000 tonnes for total national demand of 940,000 tonnes , the Shanghai Colub report said.China 's carryover stocks from 1996 into 1997 were around 250,000 tonnes , it said , going some way to explain the difference between demand and domestic production and import figures.A recent report in the official Market Daily newspaper said China 's 1996 exports of uncast and raw copper were up 2.5 percent on 1995 , to 133,708 tonnes.The Shanghai Colub report said that while China 's copper production in 1997 should be about the same as last year , demand would rise to 1.1 million tonnes , maintaining the balance between demand and available stocks. -- Shanghai newsroom ( 86-21 ) 6279-8544 International chemicals group Courtaulds Plc said on Wednesday that its wonder-fibre Tencel , global coatings business and fast-growing plastic packaging operations would spearhead expansion in the coming years.In his first major interview since taking the helm last July , chief executive Gordon Campbell laid out his plans for the group , including an increasing focus on fast-growing Asian markets and a determination to move on from its historic role as a major producer of viscose fibres .
He also told Reuters that Courtaulds would play its part in the current global restructuring of the specialty chemicals business through asset swaps , joint ventures and possibly acquisitions.He said Courtaulds was set on expanding Tencel , a highly flexible fibre derived from wood pulp , as fast and as profitably as we can , with annual sales seen approaching $ 500 million by the turn of the century .
But he added : We have to keep reminding people that we have growth prospects in areas other than Tencel , and that people do n't think that Courtaulds is a combination of Tencel and viscose .
It is Tencel , coatings and polymer products , all of which are capable of growing.Campbell 's other goals include lifting the group 's sales in Asia by 10 percent a year , raising sales at Coatings by five percent a year and doubling the proportion of sales derived from the packaging-oriented Polymer business to make it a significant third leg for Courtaulds .
Campbell said growth in Asia would be led by the Coatings business , where Courtaulds had world-leading positions in marine and yacht paints , visible on the P & amp ; O luxury liner Oriana , and in aerospace sealants .
It is also a major producer of powder coatings for consumer goods.Marine is always the bridgehead into developing markets , because it is such a well-known and internationally-recognised brand ... then we backfill behind that with our other coatings products , he said .
Campbell said the company had enjoyed annual sales growth in Asia of 15 to 20 percent over the past five years .
The only reason I scaled it down to 10 percent ( as a target ) was because it is more difficult to grow at that rate from a bigger base , he added.Polymers , whose products include toiletry and toothpaste packaging for giants like Unilever Plc and Colgate-Palmolive Co , accounted for less than 10 percent of Courtaulds ' 2.30 billion stg sales in the year to March 1996 , compared with nearly 50 percent for Coatings and 40 percent for fibres .
We ought to see it at least doubling over a period of time ... Over five years might not be a bad period , said Campbell .
He said growth would be largely organic , although Courtaulds would be interested in small , strategically useful acquisitions which expanded product range or geographic spread.Campbell said the company was in negotiations with a number of countries in the Far East over the siting of a new production plant for Tencel , which will supplement factories in Alabama in the U.S , and Grimsby , England .
He would not be drawn on the timing of an announcement.Various countries are attempting to attract us .
We have three criteria : closeness to the market , country infrastructure ranging from political stability to whether the electricity supply is reliable ... and financial incentives.He said the costs of investing in Tencel will spark a fairly sharp increase in gearing this year , but not to a level we feel concerned about.He added that the real measure is interest cover , which is currently around five times .
We expect to be able to hold it at that , Campbell said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 Tiny Scottish research company Shield Diagnostics Plc said on Monday it had moved closer to marketing a potentially world-beating test for predicting heart attacks and coronary heart disease.Shield said studies showed that patients with coronary heart disease had 30 percent higher levels of a key clotting agent , Activated Factor Twelve ( AFT ) , in their blood than healthy people.Dundee-based Shield has developed the only known test for AFT , the first element in a cascade of reactions in the blood which can eventually result in heart attacks and heart disease.It believes this will prove a much more accurate indicator of both conditions than the 500 million pounds worth of cholesterol tests taken every year.Shares in Shield closed 40 pence higher at 690 pence , to show a net gain of 393 percent since the start of the year.However , they continued to trade below the all-time peak of 928 pence reached just before news of problems with a patient-monitoring trial in the United States unnerved some investors on March 14.The company says problems with the U.S. trial , which has monitored incidence of heart atacks in 16,000 people for more than a decade , would not affect the timetable for launching a general screening test and a simple test kit for use in doctor 's surgeries.Shield said it planned to make the test itself and then license it out on a semi-exclusive basis to large diagnostic companies and to drug companies who would use it to promote their products.Talks with diagnostics companies , believed to include Abbott Laboratories Inc , are already under way.Shield declined to predict sales for the test but said it could save health services and insurers hundreds of millions of pounds a year through earlier detection and prevention.Chief executive officer Gordon Hall said caring for patients with cardiac disase in the United States alone cost $ 151 billion a year , including $ 118 billion on hospital care.Any process than can reduce this figure must be highly attractive to healthcare providers ... if five percent of cases were detected earlier and prevented , then over $ 7.5 billion could be saved , Hall said.For now Shield is more than content to have its eye not just on the 500 million pound annual cholesterol test market but on a further 380 million pounds spent on other tests related to cardiovascular disease.Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum , a long-standing supporter of Shield , said he calculates that every one percent gain in Shield 's share of the cholesterol testing market is worth 60 million pounds on its market capitalization .
Even after its price surge this year , the group is worth around 130 million pounds.However , Shield continued to try to dampen more feverish expectations about the test 's prospects on Monday.All we can say is that if you have high AFT , you are a high risk ( of a heart attack ) , said technical director Peter Foster .
We ca n't say that if you have low AFT there is no risk -- there may be other reasons ( for a heart attack ) .Shield 's caution may also stem from press and market criticism in recent week of the way it has handled news about the product.One industry specialist said many investors had not been getting a straight story on the AFT test , leading to the share 's underperformance last year.The company ran into trouble in January when it published a newsletter on AFT which was not initially sent to the stock exchange .
The newsletter sparked a sharp rise in the group 's share price .
Peptide Therapeutics Plc , a tiny Cambridge vaccine discovery company , moved firmly into the big time on Monday after signing up its second major strategic alliance in under three weeks.Shares in Peptide rocketed on news that Anglo-American drugs giant SmithKline Beecham Plc is to pay six million pounds up front for access to novel vaccines which could protect against allergic reactions ranging from mild hay fever to fatal food allergies.The stock rose 14 percent or 46 pence to 375 in late trading .
Peptide , which only floated on the stock market in November 1995 , has seen its shares rise 63 percent since the start of the year .
Shares in technology group BTG Plc , which signed over patents for the vaccine to Peptide on Monday , rose 17 1/2 pence to 480.SmithKline , the world 's biggest supplier of vaccines , is taking a 2.8 percent stake in Peptide for 3.6 million pounds ( $ 5.88 million ) and providing cash and licence payments of 2.4 million pounds .
Peptide said it could receive another 24 million pounds from SmithKline , excluding any royalties on eventual sales.SmithKline 's seal of approval for Peptide 's science follows another high profile coup late last month , when Medeva PLC agreed to transfer its know-how in developing oral and nasal vaccines to the company .
Peptide is now working on non-injectable vaccines to block a range of infections such as typhoid , flu and food poisoning by the e-coli bug.Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said Peptide had got some quite impressive partnerships .
Medeva is not to be sniffed at and SmithKline is quite a big catch .
It means they have validated what ( Peptide ) are doing.The allergy vaccine was also backed by the British government last September in the form of 450,000 pounds development grant.Peptide said it had already proved succesful in small-scale trials against food allergies , which were often lethal , and Peptide believes it could work against allergic forms of asthma and eczema as well as adverse drug reactions.Peptide licensing director Nick Higgins , a key mover behind the SmithKline deal , told Reuters that several major companies had expressed an interest in the allergy vacccine , but SmithKline offered a stable , long-term alliance.Higgins said the first allergy product could be on sale around the turn of the century.Despite the flurry of recent deals finance director John Brown said there was room for other tie-ups , notably involving technology to allow rapid identification of protease inhibitors , which block enzymes crucial to a virus 's ability to reproduce.Protease inhibitors have been used successfully against the HIV virus , but Brown said they clearly have many therapeutic possibilities , including tackling viral conditions like herpes.A novel treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is also in early stages of development.Yamaichi 's Refsum said 400 pence looks like a fair price for Peptide shares , but he added that even this level may be undervaluing the rate of progress they are making.But another analyst said the share price may be overcooked.This is a superb deal for them , he said , but added it is going to take a long time to turn the interesting science into late-stage projects .
( $ 1=.6120 Pound ) The world 's biggest business services group Rentokil Initial Plc announced sharp rises in 1996 sales and profits on Wednesday , but there were concerns that it relied heavily on newly-acquired BET for progress.Rentokil Initial , formed last year through Rentokil 's acrimonious takeover of British rival BET , said pre-tax profit jumped 48 percent to 318 million pounds ( $ 505.8 million ) while sales were up 168 percent at 2.34 billion pounds .
The dividend rose 20.5 percent to 5.06 pence per share.The results were restrained by a stronger pound , which took just over three million pounds off profits , and by a 16.4 million pound integration charge for BET .
The charge included almost 1.5 million pounds paid to former BET chief executive John Clark , although the final payment is subject to a legal dispute.Although profits were in line with analysts ' forecasts , shares in the enlarged group dropped 5.6 percent , or 25 1/2 pence , in midafternoon trading to 432 1/2 pence.Traders said there was disappointment at the performance of the core Rentokil operations , which failed to live up to their 14-year track record of delivering annual 20 percent sales and profits growth .
Excluding BET , sales were up 15 percent and profits rose nine percent to 233.4 million pounds.One trader said they managed the 20 percent gain , although the contribution from BET is very substantial .
People will be asking about their core businesses and wondering whether they would have made the grade without BET.Chief executive Sir Clive Thompson admitted that sales grew faster than profits for the first time at the core business and accepted that managers had taken their eye off the Rentokil ball while integrating BET 's 53 operations.He noted that managers at one of the weakest performing divisions , Rentokil 's famous UK pest control operations , had not moved as swiftly as usual to control costs when orders turned down.I 'd suspect that was because management were focusing on other parts of the business..The company said it expected another integration charge in 1997 of double digit millions , but not as high as 16 million pounds .
It also warned that if sterling remained at current levels it would wipe 5 percent of its full-year profits.Thompson told Reuters Financial Television that he did not expect any large acquisitions for the next two years while BET was digested , although he added that there was scope for bolt-on acquisitions in the core international businesses of hygiene and cleaning , pest control , security and textiles.Sales of peripheral BET businesses are likely to be modest , totalling between 50 and 100 million pounds over the next year.Rentokil Initial , whose services also include specialist waste disposal for hospitals and providing tropical plants for offices , also announced a two-for-one share split to make its stock more manageable for investors .
The split is expected to take effect on May 16. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 Young drug discovery group Vanguard Medica Plc said on Thursday it could wait longer than expected before seeking a fresh cash injection.Vanguard floated on the stock exchange in May , raising 46.4 million stg to fund its pipeline , which includes migraine and kidney failure drugs.We said we 'd be expecting to seek more finance in 1998 , but we took in more money than we 'd expected and may have scope for going on longer , commercial director Nick Heightman said in a telephone interview following interim results .
Vanguard said on Thursday that its pretax loss in the six months to June 30 widened to 3.7 million stg from 1.8 million a year earlier , largely due to the cost of moving migraine drug VML 251 and anti-inflammatory drug VML 295 through trials.Heightman , who joined Vanguard from drug giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc , said the company had expected to announce results of large-scale intermediate , or Phase II , trials on the migraine drug by July 1997.I think we are going to be able to do that in the first quarter , so we are about a quarter ahead , he said .
Analysts say the migraine drug , which is being developed in cooperation with SmithKline Beecham Plc accounts for around half of Vanguard 's current stock market valuation.Some studies have shown it may be more potent than the current market leader , Glaxo Wellcome 's Imigran , although Heightman said direct comparisons can not be made for another 18 months.He said another Vanguard drug , VML 252 , which promises to tackle bone damage suffered by patients with severe kidney problems , is now running neck and neck with the migraine treatment .
Although VDL 252 is currently in Phase I trials , Heightman said it is likely to progress more quickly through trials than the migraine drug.Its effectiveness is particularly easy to measure .
You can quickly tell if you are having an effect , he told Reuters .
Heightman believes both drugs could be on the market in the year 2000 if trials continue to go well.Despite the positive news from the company , Vanguard shares dropped 5 1/2 pence to 495 pence on Thursday .
Greig Middleton analyst Julia Dickson expressed surprise at the fall , saying the market does n't seem to understand the company.We think it is very cheap and I am surprised it is off , Dickson said , adding that the company 's statement was very positive and Vanguard 's meeting with analysts on Thursday showed drugs are progressing even faster than the company has officialy acknowledged.Lehman Brothers ' analyst Ian Smith said the share price adequately reflects the value of the current portfolio , with some excellent opportunities , particualrly in migraine and kidney-related problems.He said in the medium- to long-term , the value will depend on Vanguard 's ability to attract further partnerships like that with SmithKline Beecham , a cornerstone of Vanguard 's growth strategy. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 British drugs group Medeva Plc announced a strong rise in underlying profits on Wednesday and stressed its growing Americanisation with a decision to seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.Pre-tax profits before exceptional items rose 31 percent to 103.5 million pounds ( $ 167.4 million ) in 1996 , and shareholders were rewarded with a 20 percent rise in the dividend to 4.8 pence per share.Medeva 's shares , which have enjoyed a solid run this year , rose three pence to 283 pence in morning trading.Headline profits were hit by an expected 65 million pound charge for last year 's acquisition of the U.S. assets of defunct British group Fisons from Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc.Products from the business , based in Rochester , New York , helped to fuel a 30 percent rise in Medeva 's sales last year to 332 million pounds.However , analysts expressed some concern over slowing growth rates for Medeva 's top-selling and most profitable drug Methylphenidate , which is used to control attention deficit disorder in children and young adults.Sales rose 20 percent to 108 million pounds , but this was a marked slowdown from the previous year and Medeva warned that it faced increased competition in the tightly-controlled U.S. market.The Rochester acquisition helped push the proportion of Medeva 's operating profits contributed by U.S. operations to 86 percent last year from 79 percent , with sales increasing to 69 percent from 62 percent.In a sign of its growing emphasis on the United States , Medeva announced that all its U.S. businesses would operate under the name Medeva Pharmaceuticals , and said it would switch its American Depositary Receipt ( ADR ) listing to the prestigious Wall Street New York Stock Exchange from the smaller American Stock Exchange.Finance director Garry Watts told Reuters the decision reflected the strength of their American business and the fact that around 35 percent of Medeva shares were held in the United States.I think it is time that we were on the big board , he said.Chief executive Bill Bogie said Medeva , which specialises in acquiring existing businesses and products , now had a fully integrated sales force in the United States.He said the current force totalled 264 part- and full-time staff , but added that the structure is there to grow to a thousand if you want to.The impact of the restructured U.S. operation was already being felt by the Rochester products , Bogie said .
Sales of the ten products totalled $ 77 million in the first six months of Medeva 's ownership , compared to $ 100 million in the whole of 1995.One of the strongest performers was appetite inhibitor Ionamin , used to treat obesity , although Medeva said sales slowed significantly at the end of 1996 following the launch of American Home Products Corp 's rival Redux.Nomura analyst Nick Woolf said the mood of an analysts ' meeting with Medeva , which has fallen in and out of favour as investors struggled to understand its unique strategy , was really quite positive.Especially with the Rochester products , where they have got some quite dynamic ideas in terms of sales and marketing , so that is quite exciting , Woolf said.Outside the United States , Bogie said he was still interested in building up Medeva 's position in Italy and Germany , but declined to say if he had acquisitions in mind .
And he stressed Medeva 's growing links with the biotech industry as a potent source of future products to sell via Medeva 's expanding infrastructure .
( $ = 0.618 British Pounds ) Britain 's biggest chemical company ICI said on Thursday that profits collapsed last year , but it set its sights on a more profitable future with plans to float its troubled tioxide operations on the stock exchange.Profits before tax and exceptional charges dropped 37 percent to 603 million pounds ( $ 967 million ) in 1996 from 951 million a year before , while the dividend payout climbed 6.7 percent to 32.0 pence .
Both figures were towards the bottom end of market expectations.The company blamed the drop on sharp cyclical price falls in the overcrowded chlorine , titanium dioxide ( tioxide ) and polyester markets , higher oil prices and a stronger pound.Some of the downturn was offset by a bouyant performance in the fast-expanding paints business , where operating profits jumped 60 percent to 171 million stg , and a steady performance in materials , which makes acrylics and polyurethanes.Shares in the group reacted erratically to the results , rising briefly to a peak of 780 pence before slipping back 10 pence to 754-1/2 in late-morning trade.Traders said upbeat forecasts on prospects for chemical prices and news of the Tioxide float were overshadowed by continued worries over the strength of sterling and disappointment over the full-year figures.The results reinforced the group 's determination to reposition itself as a producer of light chemicals like acrylics , polyurethanes and paints and to move away from the less predictable industrial end of the market.A reshuffle of the board 's responsibilites on Thursday signalled the change , and finance director Alan Spall told Reuters ICI would be a very different company by the turn of the century.Spall said ICI planned to float the Tioxide Group , which is the world 's second biggest producer of tioxide , a whitening agent for for paints , plastics , inks and fibres , in the next 18 months .
The company is consulting advisors about its value , but Spall said its net assets totalled around $ 700 million.We are determined to reduce the proportion of assets and income from the heavy industrial end , Spall told Reuters.You can expect us to use every tool around to shift the portfolio , he added , including flotations , asset swaps , sales and acquisitions.He said the entire chemical industry was in talks on swapping key assets and pointed to Wednesday 's $ 30 million acquisition of a Puerto Rico paint company and last year 's purchase of Bunge Paints in South America as the kind of move that could be expected .
There is a whole series of potential acquistions , said Spall.ICI belieives that the downward spiral in key industrial chemical prices is now at an end .
Spall predicted a sharp rise in tioxide prices this year , and said prices of olefins and chlorofins were now improving .
1997 chemical production and demand looks better ... the balance will tighten , he said .
( $ 1=.6237 Pound ) Anglo-U.S. drugs group SmithKline Beecham Plc said on Tuesday that it expected anti-depressent Paxil/Seroxat to take over as its best-selling drug by the end of this year.In a telephone interview with Reuters finance director Hugh Collum said it was probable that Paxil/Seroxat will be the biggest selling product by the end of this year.Sales of the drug , which competes with Eli Lilly & amp ; Co 's Prozac , jumped 42 percent last year to 706 million stg , gaining ground on SmithKline 's current top seller , antibiotic Augmentin .
The added indication of panic disorder gives us added uniqueness in comparison with Prozac , said Collum .
Although he declined to give sales targets for Paxil , he said we are very optimistic and noted that Prozac sales were in excess of $ 2 billion a year.The finance director also highlighted the Havrix hepatitis A vaccine , Hycamtin for ovarian cancer and anti-emetic Kytril as potential strong growth products looking ahead , together with combination vaccines like Infanrix .
SmithKline does not expect drugs to flow from its DNA research link with Human Genome Sciences ( HGS ) until after the turn of the century , Collum said .
But he noted the licensing arrangements on DNA-based drugs already in place with major competitors including Merck & amp ; Co and Schering-Plough Corp and added we are very optimistic .
Looking back I think it was a very good investment decision.Collum said he was really very pleased at the reduction in the group 's stubbornly high debt levels , which came down to 1.64 billion stg at the end of 1996 from around 1.8 billion at the start of the year .
However , he said that with capital expenditure expected to total around 550 million stg this year , debt levels would only come down a bit in 1997.He said operating margins would continue to be affected by high research and development spending and marketing costs related to over-the-counter products.Collum said he hoped the Clinical Laboratories operation , which has been hit by changes in U.S. reimbursement rules for diagnostic tests , was back on track.We hope so .
On the other hand there are still pressures on it .
It is the third biggest in the U.S , we have a good geographical spread but it is still difficult , Collum said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 British Biotech Plc moved to reassure its shareholders on Thursday after the surprise resignation of finance director James Noble.It is a smoooth transition and we believe we have a broad and strong management team , chief executive Keith McCullagh said in a telephone interview with Reuters.We have had a number of talks with our major shareholders and they are very confident about what 's happening , as are our two brokers , he added .
News of Noble 's resignation , as the company prepares to launch its first products , came as a complete surprise to analysts who watch the company closely.However McCullagh said Noble has been considering his future for some time but his decision has only happened this week .
He denied suggestions of tension at the top of the company , saying it is an amicable departure.McCullagh praised Noble 's contribution to developing the business , which has gone from being a small research operation to stand on the brink of entering the FT-SE 100 , saying he had raised in excess of 300 million stg for the further development of the business and taken the major responsibility for developing relations with shareholders.Noble has not yet taken another post , but McCullagh said he was considering a number of opportunities.Some analysts believe Noble , who is 37 , may want to use his skills in the kind of start-up operation which British Biotech was a few years ago rather than in the large international business it will become if its major drugs , notably cancer treatment Marimastat , succeed.His interests and skills are in corporate finance and investor relations and the management of that phase of growth .
That is what he likes to do , McCullagh said.He added that Noble 's replacement would be a more traditional finance director than we have had in the past.The company would be using headhunters to find someone with strong international operating experience for a major company which has a range of subsidiaries and which is building revenues and profits.The chief executive said the decision on Thursday to name chief accountant and company secretary Anthony Weir as finance director of the group 's UK operating subsidiary , British Pharmaceuticals Ltd , was to emphasise that our financial management is continuing smoothly and soundly.He also took the opportunity to deny a suggestion in the Daily Mail newspaper that British Biotech , which raised 143 million stg in a rights issue last year , could return to the markets for further funding.We have just under 200 million stg in cash reserves and that is a considerable amount of money , said McCullagh , adding that it had sufficient funds to commercialise its lead products. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 British drug discovery group Scotia Holdings Plc said on Tuesday it remained confident about prospects for its drug pipeline despite recent setbacks.In a telephone interview with Reuters , chief executive David Horrobin said the company believed troubled diabetic drug Tarabetic would win approval in Britain , despite a formal rejection by the UK 's Medicines Control Agency.We are internally confident that we have the evidence to respond to the MCA 's concerns , said Horrobin .
He said he also believed the drug would not have to be marketed with a weakened labelling indication for its use , as some analysts have suggested .
It will be some variation of nerve damage in diabetes , he said.The MCA 's rejection of Tarabetic sent shares in Scotia plunging earlier this month , amid fears that the group would be forced into a rights issue in unfavourable circumstances.But Horrobin also told Reuters that Scotia would not resort to a rights issue before the end of 1997 or 1998 at the earliest , helping take some pressure off the shares , which rose 36 pence to 415 by midmorning , recovering from early losses .
He said trials of Foscan , currently in Phase III trials in Europe for head and neck cancer , were going well , with 250 patients recruited compared with 115 a year ago.We are getting the same results as you would get with surgical excision of early stage cancer , he said.Horrobin also said the company was excited about Amelorad , a drug for alleviating the effects of radiation therapy on the skin and red blood cells.The one-year data is considerably stronger than the six to 12 week data , and shows substantial reductions in skin damage in breast cancer , Horrobin said .
Britain 's largest life insurance group Prudential Corp said on Wednesday it is to increase its exposure to the top end of the personal financial services market by taking a near 30 percent stake in St James 's Place Capital.The move coincides with news that St James ' is seeking to buy the 49 percent of life insurer J. Rothschild Assurance ( JRA ) it does not already own and comes hot on the heels of the Pru 's purchase of mutual insurer Scottish Amicable two weeks ago.It is the attraction of JRA , set up by St James 's co-founder Sir Mark Weinberg in 1992 , and its upmarket clientele which lies behind the Pru 's interest in St James's.JRA targets high net-worth individuals , managing some 1.7 billion pounds ( $ 2.8 billion ) for its near 200,000 policyholders.In 1996 , the company announced a 41 percent growth in new business , among the highest in the industry.Despite assurances from the Pru that it would respect JRA 's wishes to stay independent , any future takeover of it or St.James would represent a neat hat-trick for Weinberg.In the 1960s he founded insurance firm Abbey Life , which he later sold to Lloyds Bank .
He then set up Allied Dunbar , eventually selling that to B.A.T Industries.However , the Pru has agreed not to increase its holding in St James 's for at least a year , unless the company attracts a bid from a third party.That undertaking was described as fundamental to the deal by Mike Wilson chief executive of JRA.The Pru will pay around 39.6 million pounds for 30.5 million St James 's shares , to add to the 10.4 million shares it already owns.Scottish Amicable holds approximately 20 percent of JRA which after conversion into St James shares will give the Pru control of 118.8 million shares or 29.9 percent.Something had to happen to sort out the interest the Pru acquired through ScotAm .
This looks an elegant intermediate step but may not be the final solution , said one industry analyst.The move gave the Pru strategic options , he said and a purchase of JRA further down the line would not conflict with its existing Prudential or Scottish Amicable brands.The value would be in keeping it separate .
It 's a fairly unique organisation and the Pru 's chief executive Peter Davis has said in the past that there 's nothing wrong with operating separate brands.St James said it believed the plans would enable JRA to achieve more rapid growth through improved incentives for the sales force and a simplification of the management structure.Plans to float JRA on the stock market , possibly as early as this summer , have been shelved.Wilson said today 's proposals would result in the same benefits for shareholders but at an earlier stage than would otherwise have been possible.JRA contributed 11 million pounds towards St James ' after tax profits from continuing operations of 25.1 million pounds in the nine months to December 31 , 1996 , up from 5.5 million pounds for the whole of the previous year.St James said it believed JRA , with its high quality , focused distribution and strong brand name was well placed to take advantage of current developments in the industry.Lord Rothschild who co-founded St James 's with Weinberg , sold half his family 's stake for 13.8 million pounds last October following his decision to step down as joint chairman after the group 's reconstruction in the summer.St James 's also owns Life Assurance Holding Corp which specialises in the acquisition and management of closed life assurance policies and Global Asset Management , a specialist fund management company .
( $ = 0.615 British Pounds ) A sharp fall in weather-related losses lifted British insurer General Accident Plc to a record first quarter on Tuesday.But a disappointing shortfall in the Scottish-based group 's net asset value ( NAV ) saw the shares slip despite the strong operating performance.Operating profits for the first three months of the year more than doubled to 114 million pounds ( $ 184.8 million ) from 55 million pounds last year.They are terrific operating figures but the NAV was a long way short of what the market was expecting , said Credit Lyonnais insurance analyst David Hudson.The disappointing NAV reflected the company 's policy of switching out of equities and into bonds .
That reduced NAV growth because of the absence of unrealised gains but increased operating profits because the higher yield comes through in investment income.The company 's NAV of 723 pence per share was some 30 pence below market expectations , said Hudson , and the shares slipped five pence to 958 pence by late morning.It 's a question of trying to weigh up the fact that profit expectations will be raised but NAV expectations have been disappointed , said Hudson.The strong operating performance , if repeated across the industry as a whole would raise the prospect of a prolonged downturn in the insurance cycle , with rates remaining under pressure.General Accident described trading as competitive over the quarter and while it had implemented premium increases in personal and commercial motor classes , elsewhere rates were static.The focus going forward was on maintaining the improvement in its underwriting performance , chief executive Bob Scott told Reuters.We 've seen growth in original currencies of about four percent in the quarter and we 've got to keep that pushing ahead , said Scott.Worldwide underwriting results improved by 50 million pounds over the period while weather costs fell by 30 million pounds - four million pounds in the UK and 20 million pounds in the U.S.The company maintained underwriting profitability in the UK while underlying trends in the U.S. and Canada improved.In Britain , the first of a series of rating increases in personal motor planned for 1997 of 3.2 percent was implemented on April 1 .
Further rises are being considered.Commercial rates were increased by eight percent.All the evidence is that private motor rates are moving up .
The Automobile Association ( AA ) survey indicates they 're definitely moving after a three or four year period when they 've been in decline .
Commercial motor is following a similar pattern , Scott said.There are some signs on content that rate increases may be being thought about but generally the weather has been good and the homeowners account has n't suffered unduly.But General Accident had seen a 50 percent increase in subsidence claims to two million pounds , although it was too early to say whether it was going to be as bad as it was in 1991 , he said.After absorbing the integration costs of Provident Mutual in 1996 , life profits were up 45 percent to 32 million pounds.Sales of life and pension products were up 9.5 percent overall with the profitability of new business continuing to grow.New UK single premium business grew by 18 percent to 253 million pounds.We 're concentrating on writing profitable new business in life .
Margins are under pressure in every area of the insurance business , life insurance as well , but we 've got a good franchise ... we can grow strongly organically we believe , said Scott.Investment earnings in the quarter fell to 133 from 135 million pounds .
( $ = 0.616 British Pounds ) British insurer Norwich Union looks set to make a sparkling debut when its shares start trading on the stock market on Monday.On flotation the company , which has more than seven million customers , is likely to be valued at around six billion pounds making it Britain 's third-largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal & amp ; Sun Alliance.As with recent demutualising building societies Halifax and Alliance & amp ; Leceister , Norwich Union 's members have seen the value of their stakes in the company steadily climb since proposals to float the group were first announced.Nearly three million Norwich policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares under the flotation plans .
The company aims to raise another 1.75 billion pounds ( $ 2.9 billion ) of capital in a public and members ' offer of new shares.Members have rushed to grab the opportunity to buy further shares at a 25 pence discount , queuing to beat the registration deadline earlier this week.Norwich Union said on Thursday it still expects the public offer to be priced at between 240 pence and 290 pence per share , 215 pence to 265 pence for members , suggesting large profits for those lucky enough to get extra shares.Bookmakers City Index are taking bets on a first day closing price of between 343 pence and 353 pence , a profit for members of at least 78 pence per share.Many are expected to cash in their profits immediately especially those who have borrowed to fund the purchase of extra shares.The minimum 300 free shares that 1.8 million with-profits members will receive is likely to be worth more than 1,000 pounds .
The average handout will be far higher with additional shares based on the value and duration of their policies.The 1.1 million non-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares.Members may be disappointed by the number of discounted shares they actually receive with a scaling down of applications a near certainty.In fact , such has been members ' appetite for extra shares that Norwich Union on Thursday announced it was clawing back 400 million pounds worth of shares from the public offering , primarily financial institutions , to satisfy demand.That took the members ' share to around half of the total offering of 2.4 billion pounds.For Norwich Union , the flotation will bring to an end more than 200 years as a mutual where ownership is held jointly by members.Demutualisation will allow it to separate the group 's life operations and thus policyholders ' returns from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business.It will also strengthen Norwich Union 's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom.Institutional demand is a big factor in the expected sharprise in the share price.Both Halifax and Alliance & amp ; Leceister saw their shares squeezed higher by financial institutions keen to buy and maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios.Like Halifax , Norwich is almost certain to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain 's largest companies later this year.Many analysts estimate fair value of the shares at anything from 280 pence to 340 pence.Norwich Union has also been touted as a possible takeover target , with Australian insurer AMP reportedly heading the list of possible predators.The probable price tag of the group now looks set to price it out reach of many who might have been interested.News of the final public and members ' offer price and provisional basis of allocation is expected to be made on June 15 .
Dealings will begin on June 16 .
( $ = 0.613 British Pounds ) A vehicle to reinsure so-called 'orphan syndicates ' could free thousands of Lloyd 's of London Names currently trapped in the insurance market according to plans published on Tuesday.John Rew , co-founder of publisher and market analyst Chatset , has invited Names - the traditional backers of Lloyd 's - to fund a feasibility study on whether a Name-owned company could be floated to re-insure orphan syndicates.Rew , is seeking to raise 600,000 pounds ( $ 972,000 ) , one third of which will be devoted to the study .
If successful , a prospectus will be issued to set up the syndicate.There are around 13,000 Names trapped on more than 50 syndicates for 1993 which are still open because of the uncertainty surrounding eventual liabilities.Normally the 1993 year would have closed at the end of 1995 .
Until they do , none of the Names can formally leave Lloyd's.In order to close a syndicate , Lloyd 's requires that the reinsurance be backed by another syndicate .
About five Lloyd 's syndicates specialise in this market.Following huge losses run-up by Lloyd 's between 1988 and 1992 , members of closed syndicates transferred outstanding liabilities to a specially created reinsurance company , Equitas , under a rescue package implemented last year.But Equitas did not take on orphan syndicates.Once orphan syndicates have been reinsured , the names ' deposit can be released.In the case of ceased or resigned Names , who may comprise as many as half the 13,000 , Lloyd 's requires 100 percent of the 'stamp capacity ' to be backed by deposit , which Rew estimates could mean up to 450 million pounds trapped within Lloyd 's .
( $ = 0.616 British Pounds ) Nearly eight million members of Britain 's largest mortgage lender , the Halifax Building Society , are in-line to pocket hundreds of pounds more than originally expected when it floats on the London stock market on June 2.If betting at London financial bookmakers is near the mark , the basic handout of 200 shares will be worth around 1,400 pounds ( $ 2,270 ) , way ahead of predictions when the flotation was first announced.The average payout would be 2,170 pounds , nearly 900 pounds more than the Halifax 's initial forecasts in January.Bookmakers , City Index and IG Index , are quoting the Halifax closing price on its first day of trading at 695-705 pence.That would value the group which converts to a bank on flotation at over 17-1/2 billion pounds and rank it among Britain 's largest dozen companies.In January , the Halifax estimated the shares would be priced at between 390 and 450 pence and in April put a 415 pence 'floor ' value on the shares sold on flotation through its free dealing service.We opened the Halifax at 660 to 670 pence yesterday .
It was very difficult to find people to sell it at that price and it looks as though it 's going to be dragged a bit higher , said IG Index 's Peter Hetherington.Around two-thirds of Halifax members will receive the basic 200 shares windfall .
Members will receive additional shares based on the level of savings.The maximum allocation for those who can claim for a mortgage account and savings account will now be worth just under 10,000 pounds.Forecasts of the size of handout have risen steadily since the original announcement of the flotation.A downward revision in the number of qualifying members gave an initial boost to the figure and the performance of financial stocks since has helped drag the price higher.The success of the Alliance and Leicester flotation in April has added to expectations of strong demand for Halifax shares .
Alliance shares rose sharply on the first days of trading as institutional investors scrambled for stock.That experience and the subsequent strength of the shares is likely to tempt many Halifax members to hold onto their handouts , at least initially.On fundamentals it 's unlikely it 's worth seven pounds but built into that price is a big chunk of scarcity premium , said one banking analyst.The concern is that there is n't going to be a lot of supply around and whatever there is will come out largely in one auction .
That 's where institutions are going to get their stock ... and they 'll only get one shot at it .
( $ = 0.615 British Pounds ) Lloyd 's of London on Wednesday said that preliminary underwriting profits had topped the one billion pound mark for the second year running despite a slight drop from the previous year 's level.The insurance market made profits of 1.005 billion pounds ( $ 1.7 billion ) before tax and after members ' personal expenses for the 1994 underwriting year .
That was down from 1993 's profits of 1.084 billion pounds but were in line with forecasts made by the market at the time of last year 's figures.Lloyd 's reports results three years in arrears .
The presence of corporate members in the 1994 numbers for the first time prompted a slightly earlier release of the figures than usual.Corporate funds have been increasingly replacing Names -- individuals whose asets have traditionally supported the market -- since 1994 and account for around 44 percent of the capital underpinning business written this year.Lloyd 's returned to profit last year after five years of record losses totalling more than eight billion pounds which had threatened the very survival of the world 's oldest insurance market.Failure of the market was avoided with the successful completion of Lloyd 's reconstruction plan last year.The fall in profitability from one year to the next is a reflection of the cyclical nature of the insurance industry.Years of high returns are often followed by more competitive pricing until an upturn in claims reverses the trend.The preliminary 1994 result is based on an initial review of syndicate returns representing 94 per cent of the market 's 1994 capacity of 10.898 billion pounds , and projections for the remaining syndicates.Final figures for the 1994 year will be published in Lloyd 's Global Results in early June when projected results for the 1995 and 1996 years of account will also be published.Lloyd 's Global Results 1995 projected a profit for the 1994 underwriting year of 1.008 billion pounds , using a sterling exchange rate of $ 1.55 .
The preliminary result of 1.005 billion is based on the exchange rate at 31 December 1996 of $ 1.71 .
( $ = 0.606 British Pounds ) Norwich Union , the British insurer which starts trading on the stock market this week , said on Sunday that its public offer of shares had been priced at the top end of pre-float forecasts following huge demand for stock.As widely expected successful applicants will pay 290 pence per share in the public offer while members will pay 265 pence , reflecting their 25 pence discount.The offer raised around 2.4 billion pounds ( $ 3.9 billion ) for Norwich Union and values it at over 5.6 billion pounds.That makes it Britain 's third largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal & amp ; Sun Alliance.But many applicants will be disappointed with the number of shares they actually receive after a sharp scaling back of allocations because of the heavy demand.Members applied for nearly four times as many shares as were available while the institutional offer was covered a mammoth 10 times.Norwich Union chief executive Allan Bridgewater declared himself delighted at the response from both members and institutional investors.It was , he said , an endorsement of the strength of the Norwich Union brand and the prospects for the business going forward.Members applying for up to 1,500 pounds worth of shares will get their full allotment but for instance an application of 10,000 pounds will get just 22 percent of shares asked for.Less than half of the 766,000 members applying for shares will receive their full allocation.In fact , such was members ' appetite that Norwich Union had to claw back 400 million pounds worth of shares from the public offering , primarily financial institutions , to satisfy it.On the start of trading on the stock market on Monday members will hold just over three-quarters of Norwich Union 's share capital.Those lucky enough to get shares may be tempted to cash-in immediately especially those borrowing to fund the purchases.But Bridewater said the company had seen no evidence that this would be the case.Many analysts estimate fair value of the shares at anything from 280 pence to 340 pence .
Bookmakers City Index predict the shares to race as high as 353 pence by the end of the first day.Under the floatation plans which brings to an end 200 years as a mutual nearly three million Norwich Union policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares under the flotation plans in addition to any extra shares in the members offer.The minimum 300 free shares 1.8 million with-profits members will receive is likely to be worth more than 1,000 pounds .
The average handout will be far higher with additional shares based on the value and duration of their policies.The 1.1 million non-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares .
Bridewater said the company had considered raising the offer price above its pre-float predictions of between 240 pence and 290 pence but had felt on balance that a 290 pence price reflected a fair price looking forward.As with recent demutualising building societies Halifax and Alliance & amp ; Leceister institutional demand will be a big factor in the expected sharp rise in the share price.Both saw their shares squeezed higher by financial institutions keen to buy and maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios.Like Halifax , Norwich Union is certain to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain 's largest companies later this year.Norwich Union has also been touted as a possible takeover target , with Australian insurer AMP reportedly heading the list of possible predators.The probable price tag of the group now looks set to price it out reach of many who might have been interested and Bridewater confirmed that there had been discussions of a takeover with anyone .
( $ = 0.611 British Pounds ) The Association of British Insurers ( ABI ) on Thursday cautioned the new Labour government against reducing tax credits on dividends or lowering incentives to pension provision in its first budget.It also called on Labour to use the budget , expected in June , to encourage long-term savings and warned it against changes in the tax system which would undermine consumer confidence.Reducing the level of tax credits on dividends would hit Personal Equity Plans ( PEPs ) and charities as well as pension business , said the ABI.It would also lead to an increased imbalance between the tax treatment of interest and dividends , it said.Advance corporation tax ( ACT ) is payable by British tax resident companies on dividends but can be offset against their mainstream corporation tax liability.Currently , institutions such as pension funds pay no tax and are able to generate extra income by claiming back the ACT paid by companies which distribute dividends net of basic tax.Because the Labour party has ruled out changes to income tax , it is widely believed to be considering reducing the credit for corporation tax paid to non-taxpaying recipients of dividends , including pension funds , to help meet spending plans.The Association 's director general Mark Boleat said its budget representations aimed to help the government 's commitment to encourage savings and develop the partnership between public and private provision.Adequate pension provision and savings are essential for everyone and it is vital that the tax system should be targeted at encouraging this and without undue complexity , said Boleat.According to the ABI , more people could be encouraged to start or increase levels of pension savings through simplifying the pension contribution rules and introducing greater flexibility for pension schemes to cover long-term care and other forms of provision.It also advised the introduction of savings accounts with tax treatment along PEP lines and extending the qualifying status for life insurance policies.Restricting tax relief on pension contributions to the basic rate of income tax would make pension savings less attractive and could lead to a transfer of funds into more tax favoured arrangements such as PEPs , it said.Similarly , removing tax relief on private medical insurance for the over 60s would substantially reduce take-up of insurance by older individuials and increase pressure on National Health spending.The ABI also urged the government not to raise the current rate of insurance premium tax , saying it would represent a threat to prudent protection.It said if individuals bore risks themselves rather than insure they could be unable to meet the resultant financial liabilities and called for the eventual abolition of it.Most non-life premiums are taxed at a rate of four percent with some classes of business such as travel insurance anbd extended warranties facing rates of 17-1/2 percentIt is a regressive tax in its effect and hits hardest those in tne poorer sectors of the community who can least afford an unexpected loss , said Boleat. -- Simon Cowell , London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 Britain 's United Assurance Group , created by the merger of Refuge and United Friendly last October , said on Thursday 2,200 jobs would be lost as a result of integration , some 400 more than had been originally expected.The company , Britain 's fourth largest home services insurer -- selling through agents who visit customers homes , said last August that it expected around a quarter of the group 's 7,100 employees would lose their jobs.United is planning to close over half its offices in an effort to cut costs by around 37 million pounds ( $ 60 million ) a year.Group chief executive George Mack said that the opportunities to make cost savings and achieve economies of scale were essential in enabling it to compete in its chosen businesses.The rationalisation and integration will involve an eventual reduction in the group 's regional and branch offices to 116 from 279.United has set aside 76.3 million pounds for the expected integration costs.The new structure would enable greater emphasis to be placed on clients ' needs , the company said.Mack declined to rule out further job losses but told Reuters that any reductions were unlikely to be material in the near term.We are looking to make sure we 're lean and efficient in our back offices and strong and expanding on our sales force front ... if anything we 're looking to expand our sales force , he said.The group has yet to get a response from the Department of Trade and Industry to its proposals that the costs for the restructuring be borne by shareholders .
Under its plans shareholders would receive a greater return for taking on the additional risk.The news of the lay-offs cames as the merged group announced pre-tax profits of 549.3 million pounds for 1996 , which included 430 million pounds from the transfer of 'orphan assets ' -- surplus insurance funds -- to shareholders.United shares rose on the figures , adding 11-1/2 pence to 485-1/2.Excluding net exceptional items of 371.3 million pounds , profits from continuing operations were up 18 percent at 193.5 million pounds.The dividend for the year was raised 35 percent to 18 pence per share.Run-off costs from the closure of the group 's motor business to new business in 1996 had been higher than expected with the pre-tax loss of 15.5 million pounds reflecting the effect of an adverse increase in the number of claims and value of settlements.Efforts would now be concentrated on the household busines which United said offered great potential to the enlarged group.We 've had a less good year this year than last .
Market conditions have been less favourable but we believe we have a strong product range and sound account and with the client base of the combined group we expect to be vigorous in expanding our portfolio , said Mack.Provisions chargeable for the 11,000 cases of possible mis-selling of pensions by the group , remained broadly unchanged at 71 million pounds.We will have a clear idea of the level at which we 're settling at the end of 1997 but we believe we 're appropriately provided for at the moment .
Until we have specific settlememnt experience there is some uncertainty in the size of that provision , Mack said .
Britain 's Scottish Amicable on Thursday defended the multi-million pound fees paid to banking advisers as part of its 2.87 billion pound ( $ 4.7 billion ) takeover by life insurer Prudential Corp.The comments came as ScotAm , based in the Scottish city of Stirling , published details of the proposed transfer of business to the Pru and benefits to policyholders as part of the acquistion plans.A policyholder circular outlining the proposals will be mailed to members over the next week .
The plans have to be approved by voting members at a special general meeting to be held on June 27.Gavin Stewart , general manger of the Scottish-based mutual insurer , admitted the cost of the deal , estimated at 34 million pounds , was a lot of money but said it was important to get things right.It was always expensive to demutualise , he said , and had to be seen in the context of similar moves by building socities.Norwich Union recently put the costs of its plans to drop mutual status and its five billion pound flotation next month at 120 million pounds.The amounts paid by ScotAm covered not only advisory fees for bankers SBC Warburg but all the logistical costs of posting circulars to more than a million policyholders and holding special meetings , said Stewart.Around 1.1 million members stand to receive cash payments averaging 550 pounds and a total package of 1,450 pounds once additional bonuses to policies are taken into account.All qualifying with-profits members will receive a fixed cash payment of 250 pounds with a further variable amount based on the size and duration of the policy.Assuming ScotAm gets the necessary approval of three-quarters of members ' who vote and the go-ahead from the Court of Session in Edinburgh , it hopes to pay cash and bonuses shortly after the completion of the deal on September 30.We 're convinced this is an excellent deal for policyholders .
600 million pounds is being paid out in cash and one billion pounds as added value in bonuses on to policies - about half now and half added to policies when they pay out , said Stewart.We think policyholders when they see the deal will recognise the value and will be pleased to vote for it.In all , the cash and bonus payments amount to 1.6 billion pounds .
In addition , the Pru is to inject 1.3 billion pounds of financial support to enable increased investment freedom for the ScotAm with profits fund , enhancing the potential for better returns.ScotAm policies are to be transferred to the Pru and held in a dedicated fund , serviced from ScotAm 's headquarters.The Pru beat off rival offers from Abbey National and Australian Mutual Provident ( AMP ) to win control of ScotAm and reinforce its position as Britain 's number one fund manager.The poilcyholders circular will lay out details of the rejected Abbey and AMP bids.ScotAm chairman Sandy Stewart said the bidding process had produced a high value for the business and a full distribution of the assets in the with-profits fund to with-profits policyholders.The members of ScotAm now have the opportunity to vote for a package which will provide additional financial security and the prospect of improved future investment returns leading to enhanced payouts , said chairman Stewart .
( $ = 0.611 British Pounds ) Czech railway unions said on Monday they would begin a nationwide strike at midnight demanding a complete overhaul of the decrepit rail system , and adding to growing unrest among public sector workers.The planned 48-hour strike , seeking a long-term plan to revive the failing state railways , is expected to completely shut passenger and freight traffic on domestic and international lines throughout the Czech Republic.We certainly will strike from midnight , the executive secretary of the Association of Unions of Rail Workers ( OSZ ) , Zdenek Jilek , told Reuters.In a statement , the OSZ said that if it did not get sufficient guarantees to repair what it says are massive problems in the quality and development of the state railways Ceske Drahy , it would prolong the strike.It will be repeated every 24 hours , the OSZ said.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus was quoted by the CTK news agency as saying on Monday that a new development plan for the railways had already been negotiated with union leaders , and the unions were simply impatient for a result.If they could not hold on until when we meet again , and they call a strike , then they are taking a great risk in front of 10 million people of this country , he was quoted as saying.The action comes on top of an alternating chain strike started last week by teachers and school workers who are forcing the closure each day of selected primary and secondary schools throughout the country.The school strikes , for pay increases and more state expenditure on teaching resources , are alternating each day among various districts.There have also been persistent threats of industrial action by doctors and health-care workers , especially at large state clinics and hospitals which have fallen into insolvency.The centre-right coalition government has resisted giving into public sector demands which might threaten its fiscally-hawkish reputation.The country posted its first state budget deficit in 1996 , at just over a billion crowns , after three straight years with a budget surplus.The rail union leaders said that their action carries no demands for pay increases , but is rather to clean up what it says are massive problems in the leadership of Ceske Drahy and the transport policy of the Czech government.They said that the condition of the rail system was critical and problems were deepening , and that the government had not fulfilled its own decisions to improve and consolidate the railways.The OSZ represents all Czech rail workers , which total more than 100,000 employess , excluding train drivers who have yet to say whether they will support the action.It is not expected that the railways would function even if the drivers do not strike.Losses of Ceske Drahy , one of the few companies not yet privatised by the post-Communist government , have been mounting.CTK quoted Ceske Drahy officials as saying the company expected losses of about seven billion crowns in 1997 after a six billion crown loss last year , and four billion in 1995.In June 1995 , the rail unions were hours away from a strike over the planned privatisation of Ceske Drahy , when the government agreed not to execute its plan at the time to restructure the loss-making railways. -- Prague Newsroom , 42-2-2423-0003 The Czech National Bank ( CNB ) on Tuesday put the largest fully-private bank , Agrobanka a.s. , under forced administration due to liquidity problems arising from the failure of another bank , Kreditni Banka a.s..The central bank , in its 12th intervention into a commercial bank in the post-Communist period , said it would guarantee all of Agrobanka 's deposits during a temporary forced administration period of an unspecified duration.In a statement issued after an overnight meeting of the Czech cabinet , the CNB said that problems of Agrobanka , the country 's fifth largest overall , had arisen as a consequence of the failure of Kreditni Banka a.s..It also said the move stemmed from the investigation of people in the Kreditni case -- in which five people connected to Kreditni have been indicted on fraud charges -- who are also connected to Agrobanka.The investigation of the fall of Kreditni Banka ... and its politicization , and charges against people connected to Agrobanka , negatively influences the liquidity position of this bank ( Agrobanka ) , the CNB said in its statement.While over 70 percent of banking activity in the country is down within the four largest banks -- each with the state as a major shareholder -- Agrobanka has grown to be the largest fully-private bank with four billion crowns ( $ 151 million ) in basic capital.In order to support Agrobanka , the CNB said it would guarantee all deposits at the bank , and that it would ensure , in cooperation with other commercial banks , sufficient financial sources for Agrobanka , should it need them.Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the central bank 's move was a preventative step aimed at keeping the banking sector sound .
There is n't even the slightest reason for any sort of banking panic , Klaus told journalists on Tuesday.He said the move by the central bank is a way to stop problems in the banking sector escalating.The fall in August of Kreditni , based in the western city of Plzen , caused a political furore and led local media to question the effectiveness of bank supervision.Kreditni and Agrobanka were linked to each other through the secretive Czech investment group Motoinvest which used both banks to finance its securities operations.An official from Motoinvest was indicted last weeekend for a debt swap scheme which police said led , in-part , to the failure of Kreditni Banka.But Motoinvest has denied any responsibility for the failure of Kreditni which caused losses of about 12 billion crowns. -- Prague Newsroom , 42-2-2423-0003 ( $ 1=26.51 Czech Crown ) Czech railway workers on Wednesday voted to extend a national railway strike , scheduled to end at midnight , for another 24 hours after the government supported a tough approach against the strikers.Jaromir Dusek , chairman of the Association of Unions of Czech Railway Workers ( OSZ ) , was quoted by the CTK news agency as saying that OSZ 's strike committee had agreed to continue the action for at least another day.Dusek was quoted by the private television channel Prima after the decision to extend the strike that the OSZ would keep extending the strike until it gets an acceptable compromise.The OSZ had originally scheduled the action as a 48-hour strike , but said it would consider extending it for 24 hours at a time if its demands were not met.The government on Wednesday backed Transport Minister Martin Riman 's hard line against the OSZ , which has shut the country 's entire rail network over potential job cuts.Government spokesman Ivo Strejcek told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government expressed its support for Riman , who has refused union demands for a long-term railway plan that guarantees jobs while sacking the current management.The spokesman declined any further comment.CTK quoted Riman later on Wednesday as saying a Prague court had ruled that the strike was illegal , but the OSZ then said that a different court had ruled that the strike was lawful.The strike , the first major nationwide post-Communist industrial action , has had little major impact on daily life , but businesses fear the shutdown in freight service will start to bite into earnings if the strike lasts longer.Cities have added buses to relieve commmuter pressure , but international trains have been stranded at borders with Germany , Poland , Austria , and Slovakia.Two rounds of talks between Riman and union officials on Tuesday failed to break the impasse , and the minister acknowledged the strike may go on longer .
Fresh talks on Wednesday have apparently not yet led to a solution.The OSZ wants the government to implement a long-term plan to revive the decrepit railway system , saying that waste and inefficiency should be cleaned up before jobs are threatened.The state railway company , Ceske Drahy , lost six billion crowns ( $ 216.4 million ) in 1996 , and expects to lose seven billion crowns this year , but the government has been unable to put together a viable plan for reversing the losses.Leaders of the OSZ reported that 75 to 80 percent of the more than 100,000 railway workers had joined the strike , but management of the railway company said over 60 percent showed up for work and signed a petition against the strike.An attempt to use workers who ignored the strike resulted in the operation of a just five trains on Wednesday , but the system was mostly idle.An effort to reconstruct Ceske Drahy ended in 1994 when the conservative government backed off privatisation plans to halt a threatened strike just hours before it was to begin.This time , Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has given ominous warnings that the unions may go too far with the strike.Most major Czech firms have said a short-term strike will have little effect on their operations , though the coal mining company Mostecka Uhelna Spolecnost a.s. said it was losing between 15-20 million crowns a day due to the action .
( $ = 27.73 Czech Crowns ) Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said if the rapid expansion in the country 's current account deficit does not subside by the end of next year , a devaluation of the crown might be needed.Speaking on Czech Television late on Wednesday , Dlouhy repeated government policy that a devaluation is currently not necessary to boost exports and stem the current account defict forecast at 5 to 6 percent of gross domestic product this year.In a panel discussion , Dlouhy was asked whether he could see the need for a devaluation of the crown in the future , if the deficit kept growing.If ( growth in the deficit ) does n't stop , then I think at the turn of 1997-98 it will be the time when you will correctly push me into more emphatic measures of the types that I would not like to take , like a devaluation , he said.Some independent economists have suggested that a nominal devaluation in the currency might be needed if the record trade deficit does not subside.But the government and other economists have said that net capital inflow , plus tourism and services revenue should comfortably pay for a merchandise trade deficit which grew to 85.3 billion crowns in the first seven months of 1996.That compares with a 49.5 billion crown trade deficit for the same period last year.I would like to see a stabilisation of the increase of the deficit during the first half of next year , Dlouhy said.If it ranges around five percent of GDP , this economy , with its revenue from tourism and services , is capable of financing it.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and central bank governor Josef Tosovsky have both recently ruled out a devaluation .
Tosovsky said a strong crown would force companies to be more efficient.The comments sent the crown to its all-time high last Friday against the mark/dollar basket to which it is pegged each day , but profit taking has eased the currency a bit in recent days.Dlouhy added that he is strongly against protectionist measures , but would seek to use other tools to help the trade balance.I will never agree with ( an ) import surcharge or higher protectionism , but I will agree with using the relevant legislative tools like the anti-dumping law , stricter ( quality ) controls , and more money for pro-export policy , Dlouhy said. -- Prague Newsroom , 42-2-2423-0003 Pop star Michael Jackson launched his first concert tour in three years on Saturday with a high-tech spectacle in Prague aimed at restoring the gleem to a career tarnished by allegations of child molestation.Jackson exploded through the floor of his futuristic stage in something best described as a missile on a monorail , and emerged decked out in gold-plated astronaut 's armour to open the concert with one of his latest hits , Scream.On a stage melding a classical Greek temple with the furnishings of a space station , Jackson matched the high tech wizardry with his still-formidable dancing skills , singing many of the hits throughout his 20-year career.The three-month HIStory World Tour actually will take hundreds of tonnes of equipment to stops in Europe , Africa , Asia , but with no dates scheduled for the Americas.Many of the estimated 120,000 spectators on Prague 's sprawling Letna Plain -- where Communist leaders once reviewed military parades -- stood awestruck as massive Jumbotron video screens dominated Jackson 's virtual-reality show.It 's more of a video game than a concert , said one Prague student as she stood dwarfed in the crowd mid-way from where the real Jackson looked like a blip on a radar screen.Fans hailing from Malta to Moscow made the trip to Prague , but the biggest of the 40,000-strong foreign contingent came from neighbouring Germany where Jackson had cancelled planned stops because of high taxes charged to visiting entertainers.Some 130,000 were expected for the two-hour concert in Prague , but ticket touts outside the gates were offering $ 30 tickets for less than $ 10.Czech President Vaclav Havel -- dubbed Rock'n Roll President as a fan of the Rolling Stones , Velvet Undergound and Frank Zappa , who have all played Prauge -- showed up for the gig although he said Jackson 's music is n't close to him.The first part of the tour has a heavy Eastern European flavour with stops planned for Hungary , Romania , Poland , and Russia , matching a theme running through his latest album HIStory which includes the song Stranger in Moscow.The first tour of the self-proclaimed King of Pop since 1993 's Dangerous tour is to back Jackson 's HIStory album which has lagged well behind his 1982 album Thriller , the all-time top seller with 44 million copies sold worldwide.But the tour marks his biggest effort yet to get Jackson 's career back on track after a long-running scandal over child-sex abuse allegations.The charges first came to light in August 1993 , when a 13-year-old boy accused Jackson of molesting him.Jackson denied wrongdoing but reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the boy , and prosecutors dropped their investigation in 1994 after the child refused to testify.The concert marks the climax of five of the most bizarre days in the history of the ancient Czech capital , as the star 's game of hide-and-seek kept a horde of fans and media guessing outside his hotel , and clogged streets in the city 's centre.Reports that Jackson was furious with a local tabloid 's rehash of the child molestation story led local media to speculate that he might cancel Saturday 's concert as he remained holed-up in his hotel suite for much of the week.On Friday , Jackson sparked a near riot when he ventured out to visit St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague Castle , and fans climbed over pews in the holy Bohemian shrine to get close.Meanwhile , concert organisers erected a giant water-filled statue of Jackson on the same hill over Prague where a massive monument to Soviet-leader Josef Stalin once stood.President Havel , the playwright whose dissident writings helped inspire Czechoslovakia 's bloodless 1989 revolution over Communism , penned a 1984 essay Thriller using Jackson-mania as his metaphor to mourn the soulless modern world .
Czech President Vaclav Havel on Wednesday told the nation that he had a near-death experience after radical surgery which removed a cancerous tumour in his lungs over four weeks ago.Speaking publicly for the first time since the December 2 operation , Havel , looking thinner and grasping for breath but speaking clearly , reflected on his illness and the loss of his wife Olga to cancer last January.In the year we have just dismissed , I have faced death twice .
First , when it came for my closest being , and second when it swirled around my hospital bed , he said in the videotaped nationally televised New Year 's greeting.Havel , in a reflective mood even more profound than usual for the former playwright , said both events caused great suffering and made him feel that the world was unjust.But on the other hand , both of these experiences , to my own surprise , I have perceived as great challenges for a new and far deeper consideration of the world in which we live.Havel said that he pondered about myself , about the mysterious order of human existence , and about the volume of signs or hidden messages which are speaking to us from within this order , which we are mostly ignoring.Havel , the chain-smoking leader of Prague 's bloodless 1989 revolution over communism , entered a clinic on November 25 with what his office called a case of pneumonia.A week later Doctors performed exploratory surgery and found a small malignant tumour in the right lobe of his lungs.Surgeons decided immediately to remove half of the lobe , and said later that it appeared that the cancer was caught in an early stage and had not spread to other tissue.But Havel , aged 60 , developed pneumonia in the left lobe soon after the surgery and fought off a high fever , the seriousness of which is only now coming to light.For weeks he was on a respirator connected through his throat but was released from hospital on the day after Christmas after the pneumonia and fever subsided.Doctors have said that Havel 's condition has been steadily improving and his prospects for a full recovery are good.The less than eight-minute address , which he taped in a business suit sitting at a desk in his private west Prague villa , replaced his traditional New Year 's speech which is normally much longer.Havel concentrated his prepared remarks on creating a deeper understanding of common goals in Czech society.He recalled that 1996 brough many important , beautiful , and painful things to the Czech public.He said the year was tainted by the failure of several banks , political spats , and various corruption which had emerged from the country 's massive post-Communist privatisation programme and economic reforms.I implore you ... to try to understand all of these ugly things as warning signs calling us all to a newer and deeper consideration of the sense of our common affairs , he said.The greatly popular Havel also thanked all who have supported him through his illness , and said he hoped that Czechs still could rely on him.The Czech agency CTK reported on Wednesday that Havel 's staff at Prague Castle had agreed to stop smoking in the office in a show of solidarity with the president who was advised by doctors to give up his several-packs-a-day habit.He made no mention however of his smoking in the speech.Havel is expected in February to finalise a long-awaited declaration of reconciliation with Germany , which has been a focus of his presidency , aiming to put an end to anxiety of the neighbouring countries over World War Two and its aftermath .
The Czech central bank should not prop up the crown even if it fell to the low end of its fluctuation band , a leading Czech economist said on Thursday.Without central bank intervention the market could force the crown as low as 20 percent below parity with its mark/dollar basket , Jan Svejnar , director of the Economics Institute at the Czech Academy of Sciences , said in an interview.This would give natural support to troubled Czech exports , he added.Svejnar said he was not advising an official devaluation of the currency , but calling for the central bank to allow a market-driven depreciation in line with the existing macroeconomic situation.I 'm not saying that the central bank should go and devalue ( but ) ... should be ready to let the currency depreciate , said Svejnar , who is also a professor at the University of Michigan.The central bank and Czech government have repeatedly ruled out a devaluation to boost exports , and the Czech National Bank agreed in its meeting on Thursday not to change its current policies.The central bank fixes the crown daily against a mark/dollar basket but allows it to fluctuate on the market within a corridor of plus or minus 7.5 percent of its basket parity.The CNB widened the band in February 1996 from plus/minus 0.5 percent and since then has virtually matched the market rate each day .
The crown was fixed at the equivalent of 1.39 percent on Thursday.With the country 's current account deficit exceeding eight percent of gross domestic product , the crown fell last week to a nine-month low after hitting record levels of 5.51 percent above basket parity in early February.Investors have moved into crown paper to take advantage of real interest rate differentials with major currencies.What I am more worried about is ... sooner or later ( the trade balance ) will become untenable , said Svejnar , adding that foreign capital would then flee the country.He said that with the central bank foreign exchange reserves covering just about five months of average imports , central bank intervention to prop up the crown would be futile.Czechs should take a lesson from the 1992 crash of the British pound when the Bank of England made a fruitless attempt to defend its currency against speculators , who ultimately forced the pound from the European exchange rate mechanism , he said.Essentially , ( the Bank of England ) lost a significant part of its reserves and had to devalue the pound or let the pound devalue anyway , Svejnar said .
Czech President Vaclav Havel said on Wednesday he felt more deeply about the world after facing the possibility of death when he underwent major surgery to remove a cancerous lung tumour a month ago.In the year we have just dismissed , I have faced death twice .
First when it came for my closest being and second when it swirled around my hospital bed , he said in a New Year address on national television.Speaking publicly for the first time since the December 2 operation , Havel reflected on his illness and the loss of his wife Olga to cancer last January.The former playwright , looking thinner , said both events had caused great suffering and made him feel the world was unjust.But on the other hand both of these experiences , to my own surprise , I have perceived as great challenges for a new and far deeper consideration of the world in which we live , said Havel.He said he had thought about myself , about the mysterious order of human existence , and about the volume of signs or hidden messages which are speaking to us from within this order , which we are mostly ignoring.Havel , the chain-smoking leader of Prague 's bloodless 1989 overthrow of Communist rule , entered a clinic on November 25 with what his office called a case of pneumonia.A week later doctors performed exploratory surgery and found a small malignant tumour in his lungs.Surgeons decided to operate immediately and said later it appeared the cancer had been caught at an early stage and had not spread.But Havel , 60 , developed pneumonia in his lungs soon afterwards and fought off a high fever , the seriousness of which is only now coming to light.For a while he was on a respirator connected through his throat but was released from hospital the day after Christmas.Doctors have said Havel 's condition has been steadily improving and that his prospects for a full recovery were good.The just under eight-minute address , which he made in a business suit sitting at a desk in his private west Prague villa , replaced his traditional and normally much longer New Year 's speech.Havel called for a deeper understanding of common goals in Czech society.He said 1996 had brought many important , beautiful , and painful things to the Czech public.The year was tainted by the failure of several banks , political spats and corruption cases which had emerged from the country 's massive post-Communist privatisation programme and economic reforms.I implore you ... to try to understand all of these ugly things as warning signs calling us all to a newer and deeper consideration of the sense of our common affairs , he said.Havel thanked all who had supported him through his illness and said he hoped Czechs could still rely on him.The Czech news agency CTK reported on Wednesday that Havel 's staff at Prague Castle had agreed to stop smoking in the office in a show of solidarity with the president , who has been advised by doctors to give up his several packs a day habit .
The Czechs , a small nation with an impressive history of Oscar success , on Tuesday showered praise on Jan and Zdenek Sverak for bringing home a coveted Academy Award for their film Kolya.The story of an ageing bachelor 's reawakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague 's bloodless 1989 Velvet Revolution won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in the ceremony late on Monday.President Vaclav Havel , a former dissident playwright under communism who acted in films himself , sent a victory telegram to the Sveraks in Los Angeles.I am pleased with the great success of your film .
I am happy that after many years a Czech film has again received the Oscar , Havel 's press office quoted the telegram as saying.Czech media also applauded for the win for the director Jan , 31 , and his scriptwriter father Zdenek , who played the bachelor in Kolya.The Oscar Goes to Prague shouted the capital 's daily Vecernik Praha.It was the first Czech foreign language film Oscar since Jiri Menzel 's won in 1968 with Closely Observed Trains one of a spate of admired movies known worldwide as the Czech New Wave.Elmar Klos from Slovakia -- now independent , but then part of Czechoslovakia -- won the best foreign film Oscar in 1966 for The Shop On Main Street.The Czech Republic , with a population of 10 million , also lays claim to director Milos Forman , a Prague native who made the Oscar-winning Amadeus in 1985 and One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest in 1976 after emigrating to the United States.Forman failed to pick up best director honours on Monday after his nomination for The People Versus Larry Flint , after winning a Golden Globe and the Berlin 's Golden Bear for the film.The Sverak team made their first international splash in 1992 , when the post-war drama-comedy Elementary School earned a first Oscar nomination but lost .
Zdenek is currently working on the team 's first original English-language script.Critics say Kolya , a politically-charged comedy-drama which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces , may be one of the region 's best offerings since the Czech New Wave.The film is about how the understanding between nations is much more important than the power , Sverak told reporters backstage after winning the Oscar.Earlier this month Kolya won the Czech version of the Oscar , the Czech Lev ( Lion ) , for best picture , but Zdenek Sverak was edged out for the best Czech actor award by Bolek Polivka , a popular cabaret comedian.Kolya was favoured to take home the Oscar after winning Hollywood 's Golden Globe for best foreign language film in January .
Czech railway unions said on Monday they would begin a nationwide strike at midnight demanding a complete overhaul of the decrepit rail system , and adding to growing unrest among public sector workers.The planned 48-hour strike , seeking a long-term plan to revive the failing state railways , is expected to completely shut passenger and freight traffic on domestic and international lines throughout the Czech Republic.We certainly will strike from midnight , the executive secretary of the Association of Unions of Rail Workers ( OSZ ) , Zdenek Jilek , told Reuters.In a statement , the OSZ said that if it did not get sufficient guarantees to repair what it says are massive problems in the quality and development of the state railways Ceske Drahy , it would prolong the strike.It will be repeated every 24 hours , the OSZ said.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus was quoted by the CTK news agency as saying on Monday that a new development plan for the railways had already been negotiated with union leaders , and the unions were simply impatient for a result.If they could not hold on until when we meet again , and they call a strike , then they are taking a great risk in front of 10 million people of this country , he was quoted as saying.The action comes on top of an alternating chain strike started last week by teachers and school workers who are forcing the closure each day of selected primary and secondary schools throughout the country.The school strikes , for pay increases and more state expenditure on teaching resources , are alternating each day among various districts.There have also been persistent threats of industrial action by doctors and health-care workers , especially at large state clinics and hospitals which have fallen into insolvency.The centre-right coalition government has resisted giving into public sector demands which might threaten its fiscally-hawkish reputation.The country posted its first state budget deficit in 1996 , at just over one billion crowns ( $ 36 million ) , after three straight years with a budget surplus.The rail union leaders said that their action carries no demands for pay increases , but is rather to clean up what it says are massive problems in the leadership of Ceske Drahy and the transport policy of the Czech government.They said that the condition of the rail system was critical and problems were deepening , and that the government had not fulfilled its own decisions to improve and consolidate the railways.The OSZ represents all Czech rail workers , which total more than 100,000 employees , excluding train drivers who have yet to say whether they will support the action.It is not expected that the railways would function even if the drivers do not strike.Losses of Ceske Drahy , one of the few companies not yet privatised by the post-Communist government , have been mounting.CTK quoted Ceske Drahy officials as saying the company expected losses of about seven billion crowns in 1997 after a six billion crown loss last year , and four billion in 1995.In June 1995 , the rail unions were hours away from a strike over the planned privatisation of Ceske Drahy , when the government agreed not to execute its plan at the time to restructure the loss-making railways .
( $ = 27.78 Czech Crowns ) Hong Kong 's future leader Tung Chee-hwa assured Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon on Friday that Filipino workers working in the territory will be allowed to stay after it reverts to Chinese rule on July 1.Siazon , who arrived in the territory late on Thursday , said he also officially told Tung of Manila 's decision in late March to waive visa requirements for Hong Kong holders of post-handover passports when they visit the Philippines.Hong Kong , a British colony of more than 150 years , will become a Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) under Chinese rule at the stroke of midnight on June 30.Nearly 140,000 Philippine workers , mainly working as maids , live in the vibrant territory.But with Hong Kong becoming part of China , many Filipinos fear they will be expelled and replaced through an influx of domestic servants from mainland China.Siazon said such worries were unwarranted.Mr Tung said he does not see any change to the status of the Filipinos working here , he said in an interview.They are contributing to the Hong Kong economy and in the future , this will not change , he said.An estimated seven million Filipinos working in more than 137 countries remit about US $ 7 billion each year back to their relatively poor country.Siazon , who spoke with Tung for half an hour , also met Governor Chris Patten and Financial Secretary Donald Tsang in separate meetings.He said his country 's granting of visa-free entry to Hong Kong passport holders was a pledge of Manila 's support for the territory during its sovereignty change.We have decided to recognise the Hong Kong SAR passport and have ( them ) visa-free because we have full confidence in the future of Hong Kong and the smooth transition of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule , he said.I told Mr Tung the Philippines is deeply committed to supporting Hong Kong 's role in the future because Hong Kong is a big trading and investment partner , he said.Each year , some 350,000 Filipinos visit Hong Kong while 290,000 Hong Kong people visit the Philippines and both governments were keen to continue the close friendship , he said.Siazon said he had invited Tung to visit Manila.But right now he 's extremely busy , so it will probably be after the transition , he said .
An advisor to Governor Chris Patten 's inner cabinet said on Monday that property in Hong Kong has become like gold that is not merely worn but kept and accumulated -- giving rise to abnormal demand.Chen Kwan-yiu , a member on the executive council , also hinted that a quick fix to the British colony 's property woes was unlikely.The current supply of flats is actually adequate for demand , but property has become like gold in the 60s , when it was not only used but was kept as an investment , Chen said.So it has led to an abnormal demand , Chen told reporters .
The economist said the solution to the problem was to provide more land for residential use.Hong Kong 's property sector has been in the news in recent months with the government and private property developers coming under intense public fire for soaring housing prices.Many young working adults in Hong Kong continue to live with their parents due to notoriously high rents , and the option of owning a home is increasingly seen beyond the reach of many of the territory 's 6.4 million population.If ever we see a revolution in Hong Kong , it 'll be over housing .
Young people do n't have a hope in hell to own their own homes anymore , retiree Alex Lo , 55 , told Reuters.It 's now the giant property developers who control Hong Kong , said Lo , who lives in a tiny government flat in Tai Po with his wife and three children in their twenties.Hong Kong has much on its mind as the handover to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 nears , and in the last few weeks has had to cope with extra stress caused by the housing woes.On March 12 , a box thought to contain a bomb planted outside the legislative council building in the territory 's Central district froze traffic for several hours.The box turned out to be empty , but its message was no less troubling .
Writing on the box complained that the government and the territory 's future leader , Tung Chee-hwa , did not care about soaring property prices.And on Thursday , a fist-fight broke out at a flat sale .
One property agent was knocked out and two guards were arrested.The government last week acted to curb speculation by requiring developers to put more unfinished flats on the market The move was followed by a 25 basis point rise in the prime lending rate to 8.75 percent , which bankers said could marginally affect the property market.But they seemed to have little effect.Ever-strong demand led developer Cheung Kong ( Holdings ) Ltd to release more units on Sunday in the sale of part of its Kingswood Villas development in the New Territories.A total of 600 units , priced mostly at HK $ 4,793 ( US $ 620 ) per square foot , was sold in addition to the 264 flats originally put up for sale .
( US $ 1 = HK $ 7.73 ) Hong Kong 's future leader Tung Chee-hwa assured the Democratic Party on Tuesday that it will not be cast out into the cold when China resumes control over the territory at midnight June 30.But Tung rejected the Democrats ' request to leave Hong Kong 's election system alone , party chairman Martin Lee said.Speaking to reporters after a one-hour meeting with Tung , Lee said his party wanted spokesmen on various issues to have direct contact with the future government.Mr Tung is supportive of the idea and we are very happy , he said.The Democrats accuse Tung of seeking to alter Hong Kong 's first-past-the-post voting methods specifically to dilute their presence in Hong Kong 's legislature.Tung and his advisers are considering replacing the British-style system with a form of proportional representation or multi-seat single vote system and have sought the views of the public.This seems to be a case of starting with the desired result , Lee said.Reducing the number of democrats and working backwards to an electoral system which will produce this result.Hong Kong has been a British colony for more than 150 years .
A China-selected lawmaking chamber is poised to replace the current elected body which Beijing will disband at the handover.The Democratic Party , the largest party with 19 seats in the current legislature , boycotted the incoming provisional chamber , and its members will be cast into the political wilderness for about a year.They plan to contest the first post-handover elections scheduled in mid-1998 under new electoral laws to be passed by the interim-appointed chamber.Tung denies scrapping the first-past-the-post system is designed to dilute the influence of the democrats.Lee said Tung had rejected the Democratic Party 's proposal for a taskforce to amend Hong Kong 's future constitition , the China-promulgated Basic Law , to speed the path to full democracy in Hong Kong.We raised with Mr Tung the setting up of a taskforce to review the Basic Law provisions on democracy .
We told Mr Tung that the pace for democratisation as contained in the Basic Law is much , much too slow , Lee said.Even by the year 2003 , still half of the legislature will not be democratically elected by the people of Hong Kong.But Mr Tung gave us a flat no ... We are extremely unhappy about that , Lee said.The Basic Law provides for creeping democratisation leading to a fully elected legislature after 10 years.At present , only 20 of the 60 seats are directly elected .
Ten are returned by an electoral college made up of local civic authority chiefs and the rest are allocated to business and professional bodies in what are known as functional constituencies .
Asia 's party of the century arouses few cheers from a minority of active democrats in Hong Kong who fear Chinese rule will bring repression of liberties.For these activists , campaigning at home and abroad for better guarantees from Beijing , there is little cause for celebration when the clock strikes midnight this June 30.They plan protests as Britain hands Hong Kong back to China , which brands some supporters as subversive , and in the future to test the extent of cherished civil liberties.Leaders of the movement have thrown down a gauntlet to Chinese authorities by vowing to force their way into parliament as the world watches Britain hand the territory back to China.The pro-democracy campaigners remain sceptical about China 's pledged self-rule for Hong Kong for 50 years under a one country , two systems formula espoused by the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.Worries abound , they say , that the future administration under shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa , whom China supports , will curb rights and civil liberties in the territory of 6.4 million.When international attention dies down , who knows what will happen ?
What will happen when people become complacent ?
said Law Yuk-kai , director of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.Controversially , when Hong Kong , a British colony of 156 years , reverts to China , an interim 60-member lawmaking chamber will replace the existing elected legislature , to the dismay of democrats and the West.With this one step , Beijing will remove at a stroke democratic reforms introduced unilaterally by the British-led administration during its twilight years of rule in Hong Kong.The interim chamber has also passed laws which from July 1 will ban foreign funding for political groups and require people to apply for police permits before they can stage protests.Now , the police need only be informed ahead of protests.Even more sinister , activists say , is Tung 's introduction of a broad concept of national security which empowers the police to reject applications if they are thought to threaten Hong Kong 's 'security ' or China 's territorial integrity.I expect the human rights situation to deteriorate , if Hong Kong people do n't stand firm and there is no support from political leaders overseas , Law said in a recent interview.If such concepts like 'national security ' are used for political convenience , it 's an end to all freedoms .
Anything that is thought to challenge the future administration can be struck down by this concept , he said.Chinese officials have also warned against any advocacy of independence for Taiwan or Tibet , and self-censorship has wormed its way into the local press , which until recently was among the world 's freest and most vibrant.Journalists have told us they are worried and are under great pressure and are practising self-censorship , Law said.Chinese political dissidents in exile have warned of tough days ahead and said they could not conceive of China keeping to its pledge of a high degree of self rule for Hong Kong.In the long term , I can not believe China 's dictatorship .
In the last few decades , this government has never kept to its words .
It has always gone back on its promises , its policies on Tibet , many other policies , said Liu Qing , who was jailed for 10 years before leaving for the United States in 1992.Another warned of possible abuses .
'National seurity ' worries me , there is a real danger .
It has already been used against Chinese people as a tool to suppress political dissent .
It can be similarly abused in Hong Kong , said Xiao Qiang , executive director of the New York-based Human Rights in China lobby group , in a recent interview.But some inveterate pro-democracy activists are here to stay , despite the odds .
Emboldened by the international glare enveloping Hong Kong , hopefully for years to come , they are banking on hopes that Beijing would not dare go too far.This is my home and I do n't intend to leave at all , said Martin Lee , leader of the Democratic Party , Hong Kong 's largest party.I do n't think they are going to do anything nasty to my family .
I do n't believe they will dare do such things -- what will people say if anything happens ?
said the accomplished lawyer , who has no foreign passport or residency rights overseas.But the fear runs deeper for some .
Law , married to a fellow activist , has no children -- by choice .
My wife and I , we can choose the way we want to live , but our children ca n't , Law , an activist for over 10 years , said.Taxi-driver Shing Wai-pong , a seasoned protestor , has packed off his Malaysian-Chinese wife and daughter to Malaysia .
I am prepared for the worst .
I am not afraid of death or jail .
My wife and child left Hong Kong so now I have nothing to worry about , he said recently .
Democracy leader Martin Lee returned on Monday from a foreign tour highlighted by talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and convinced Hong Kong has friends anxious to preserve its freedoms after China takes over.The head of the Hong Kong Democratic Party met Clinton at the White House and won a promise of U.S. support after the British colony is handed back to China on July 1.Analysts contrasted Lee 's tour of the United States , Canada and Switzerland with the recent falling popularity poll ratings suffered by the territory 's future leader , Tung Chee-hwa , who last week called off his own U.S. tour amid a wave of criticism of proposed plans to curb civil liberties after the handover.Tung , who will govern from July 1 , was criticised by the United States , Britain and Hong Kong 's pro-democracy camp for plans to ban foreign funding and curb protests.He caused another stir when he admitted donating 50,000 sterling ( US $ 81,500 ) to Britain 's Conservative Party in 1992.Lee has made quite a victory .
Quite apart from what he achieved from his tour , he subjected himself to scrutiny by groups of people , said law professor and political analyst Nihal Jayawickrama of the University of Hong Kong.While that was happening , we had Mr Tung saying he was disappointed with Lee and the exposure for his own activities which has affected his credibility quite considerably.Jubilant after his hectic month-long 12-city lobbying tour , Lee said he was convinced Hong Kong had friends worldwide who wanted to preserve its freedoms after China takes over.Lee said governments in the West had a moral responsibility to see that China abides by its treaty pledge of allowing Hong Kong 's freewheeling lifestyle to endure for another 50 years.We 're not fighting alone for human rights and democracy in Hong Kong .
We have many friends in Australia , New Zealand , Canada , the United States and Europe , he said.Hong Kong , a British colony for more than 150 years , reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 under a 1984 treaty.Many in the bustling territory of 6.4 million fear a loss of fundamental freedoms after the handover , now just 71 days away.Apart from the latest threat of curbs on freedom , China plans to replace Hong Kong 's elected legislature with one carefully crafted by Beijing.We reminded the U.S. government and all other governments that supported the Joint Declaration they owe Hong Kong a moral responsibility to make sure the rule of law , civil liberties are preserved after the sovereignty changeover , Lee said.Lee , whose return coincided with the arrival of a small advance party of Chinese soldiers to prepare for the rest of the garrison on July 1 , said he did not think it was necessary to have Chinese troops in Hong Kong.The stationing of troops in Shenzhen would have been sufficient to protect Hong Kong if necessary , he said.The British garrison was stationed here for an obvious reason , that is in case there was an invasion from a certain direction .
But when Hong Kong is part of China there is no question of Hong Kong facing such a threat , he said.Lee said he was deeply worried about the impact of Tung 's planned curbs on protests and the ban on overseas fund-raising.If Mr Tung stops us , and it becomes law , we will have to decide what to do , he said .
His party raised HK $ 2.5 million ( US $ 323,000 ) from Chinese communities in its month-long tour .
( US $ 1 = HK $ 7.73 ) The United States on Friday said it would grant 10-year multiple-entry visas to holders of Hong Kong passports issued after China takes back the territory , clearing a major worry here about travel rights.U.S .
Consul-General Richard Boucher said holders of future Hong Kong passports would get the same visa treatment now enjoyed by holders of Hong Kong British travel documents.We intend to issue maximum validity visas for the United States for people with the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) passport , Boucher told reporters.The decision was a milestone in international recognition of the future SAR passport and removed a question mark hanging over Hong Kong as China prepares to resume sovereignty at midnight on June 30 , ending 156 years of British colonial rule.From July 1 , the territory of 6.4 million people will become a Special Administrative Region of China , and winning easy travel access to major destinations is viewed as a barometer of confidence in the territory 's future prospects.Easy travel rights are also seen as key to maintaining Hong Kong 's position as an international business and tourism centre.So far , nine countries -- Britain , Singapore , Canada , the Philippines , Western Samoa , Trinidad and Tobago , Namibia , Benin , and San Marino -- have gone further to grant full visa-free entry for SAR passports , but other nations have hesitated.Japan , for example , has said it will treat SAR passports more favourably than Chinese passports , but it has not yet revealed details.Boucher said the same visa application procedures and conditions for approval as now would apply after the handover for Hong Kong people wishing to visit the United States.The same application procedures , the same forms , the same facilities will apply ... the requirements are exactly the same .
The decisions on yes or no are exactly the same , he said.Hong Kong Director of Immigration Regina Ip welcomed Washington 's decision and saw it as a confidence booster.Absolutely , this will be a very useful confidence booster .
So far , nine countries will give visa-free treatment to Hong Kong SAR passports ... a few more are considering and we will probably have a lot more before July 1 , she said.In return , U.S. citizens would be accorded the same visa-free entry privilege which they now enjoy , she said.Current arrangements are that they may do so without a visa for visits up to one month .
The Hong Kong government has no plans to change the current practice , Ip said.While the status of Hong Kong people travelling to the United States after July 1 has become clearer , questions still hang over locals with U.S. passports but who want to hold on to their Hong Kong permanent residency.China , which does not recognise dual nationality , has said ethnic Chinese Hong Kong residents will be regarded as Chinese nationals with no right to foreign consular protection unless they declare their foreign citizenship.Boucher indicated that Hong Kong residents with U.S. passports should make use of them when crossing borders to make clear their citizenship.An American citizen is an American citizen and we will endeavour to assist ( them ) whenever they need assistance.By taking advantage of their passports , it 's easier for both sides to understand who is regarded an American and how we can protect them , Boucher said.Separately , U.S. Ambassader to Beijing James Sasser told a business lunch in Hong Kong that Washington would keep a keen eye on the territory after the handover.Americans have invested $ 15 billion here .
To sustain this U.S. presence requires a society governed by the rule of law and protection of basic freedom , he said .
In another sign of Britain 's slow retreat from Hong Kong before its handover to China , the British army on Friday packed up its radio station -- literally into a shipping container.Britain departs its colony of more than 150 years at midnight on June 30 and the British Forces Broadcasting Service ( BFBS ) plans to keep broadcasting until the very last moment , but not from its old studio in military headquarters.In an informal ceremony to the tones of a lone bagpiper , Commodore Peter Melson , chief of staff of the British forces in the territory , declared the new BFBS station open in a standard 20-foot container.The air-conditioned container sits alongside an office block at the Prince of Wales Barracks on Hong Kong 's harbour front and comes replete with disc-jockey , studio equipment and soundproof styrofoam walls.It works !
Melson declared to reporters as he stepped out of the container -- commissioned for use in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War -- after a token inspection.A staff of 15 who used to occupy two proper studios at the barracks will keep the station going until the handover although the shack , as it is called by its users , itself will be loaded on the supply and troop ship Sir Percivale on June 29.The extension to the Hong Kong Convention Centre , where the grand handover ceremony will be held , can be seen from container 's sole window.I 'm sure there 'll be something in the last hours .
It 's not something we 'll let go easily , not after so long , Melson said.BFBS , with a network of other stations , has operated since 1971 in Hong Kong , where it hit a peak staff strength of 45 in 1990 .
It broadcasts non-stop news and programmes from Britain.The British army has been packing up since last year , leaving only a skeletal force just before the handover.Melson said BFBS has been more than a mere radio station to the garrison in the territory.It 's meant an awful lot over the years , having our own radio station in Hong Kong .
It 's something we 've been able to relate to , to talk to , have requests from loved ones at home .
Britain and China signalled on Monday that they are set to discuss Beijing 's late request to deploy more troops in Hong Kong before the territory reverts to Chinese rule at midnight this June 30.Top British and Chinese officials on the Joint Liaison Group ( JLG ) , a body handling details of Hong Kong 's transfer , also said they were confident the matter would soon be resolved.Beijing 's request to have more of its People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) troops positioned in Hong Kong before the handover emerged last week and was quickly surrounded in controversy.British officials were adamant there was no question of London agreeing to China 's request as the British garrison alone remains responsible till the handover , barely two weeks away.But on Monday , a top British representative on the JLG said both sides would soon discuss the issue.The subject has been on our agenda to discuss and we 're continuing to discuss it , Hugh Davies told reporters.Zhao Jihua , Davies ' Chinese counterpart on the JLG , told reporters that Beijing thought it was necessary to have more troops deployed in Hong Kong before the handover.There is a practical need .
It is a matter that needs to be resolved and we hope to solve it , Zhao said.China has said it needs a few hours before the midnight handover ceremony to deploy its main force.Beijing has already sent an advance party of 200 soldiers to prepare garrison , supply and communication facilities .
Britain insisted they be unarmed and wear uniforms only in barracks.Many Hong Kong people are jittery about the arrival of the PLA as they remember the comunist army 's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square in 1989.But both Zhao and Davies gave no sign whether Britain would concede to China 's latest request.We 've made our position clear already , Davies said , but he added : I think the arrival of the PLA will take place as around July 1 .
We 're not going to discuss what we 're going to be talking about privately on the subject.Beijing 's request to send more troops and London 's clear refusal last week threatened to deepen a rift over Hong Kong 's sovereignty changeover.London , together with Washington , angered Beijing last week by saying they will boycott the swearing-in of a China-backed legislature during the midnight handover party to replace Hong Kong 's current democratically-elected chamber.Beijing has vowed to disband the existing chamber , removing at a stroke democratic reforms introduced unilaterally by Britain inthe twilight years of its rule in Hong Kong .
Future legislators on Saturday defied an imminent legal challenge and passed a string of laws for Hong Kong which will come into effect after the territory reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.The 60-member provisional legislature met in Shenzhen , just across the border in China , where it was presented with a series of bills by officials of the future administration led by Hong Kong 's chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa.A crucial bill governing residency rights in Hong Kong after Britain hands it back to China on July 1 passed through two readings , Hong Kong 's Wharf Cable TV station reported.Three bills governing the membership of municipal bodies after the handover passed through all three readings , it said.Under rules laid down earlier by the future chamber , proposed bills must go through three readings before July 1.They will then be ratified as post-handover Hong Kong laws on July 1.The provisional legislature was formed under Beijing 's auspices in December and is poised to replace the current elected chamber , which China will disband , on July 1.Its meeting in Shenzhen , however , follows a warning by the Democratic Party that it would file a lawsuit against the shadow chamber within the next few days claiming it was illegal to have two legislatures operating at the same time.The imminent lawsuit has been facilitated by an earlier ruling by Hong Kong 's Supreme Court allowing the Democrats to use government funds to fight laws passed by the shadow chamber.But in Shenzhen , members of the provisional legislature scoffed at the imminent legal battle and claimed the future lawmaking chamber had strong legal basis.I 'm only sad that Hong Kong must spend so much money over something when the outcome , everyone knows , is a foregone conclusion , said provisional legislator Tam Yiu-chung.The president of the shadow body , Rita Fan , also waved it off.It ( the threatened lawsuit ) wo n't affect the work of the provisional legislature ... It does n't bother me at all .
I 'm confident we will prevail in the end , Fan told reporters.The provisional chamber holds meetings , however , in Shenzhen , instead of Hong Kong , to fend off potential legal attacks.The bill on residency rights , which was unveiled by future leader Tung on Friday , will tighten rules on immigrants getting permanent residency after July 1 , local television stations reported.It proposes that illegal immigrants , after residing in the territory for seven years , need permission from the immigration chief to receive permanent right of abode.Under the current system , they are automatically granted permanent residency after seven years.Critics on Saturday lambasted the bill as a way of keeping out Chinese dissidents , but a senior Tung aide dismissed the charge.Everyone , if they enter Hong Kong illegally , can not get permanent residency in Hong Kong .
This does not mean we are targeting any group of people , Elsie Leung , the future Justice Secretary told reporters.Provisional legislator Henry Tang agreed.We will be part of China , in the event that there is any advocacy of splitting with the motherland , or other such activities , we must have laws ( against them ) , Tang said .
Hong Kong 's future leader Tung Chee-hwa on Wednesday launched plans to turn back the clock and curb demonstrations and foreign funding for political parties after the territory is handed back to China this year.The planned changes , though controversial , were expected after China 's parliament , or National People 's Congress , resolved in late February that a string of existing Hong Kong laws protecting civil liberties and rights should be changed.China 's decision , based on the argument that existing laws breach Hong Kong 's post-handover constitution , takes effect on July 1 , when the British colony of 156 years reverts to China.It will also remove at a stroke democratic freedoms introduced during the office of British Governor Chris Patten , whom China considers an arch-foe.Top civil servant Michael Suen , who has been seconded to Tung 's office to help craft the post-handover government , said the changes , outlined in a consultation paper released to the media , were needed because of China 's decision.The NPC took the action because China views the political liberalisation of Hong Kong in the twilight years of British rule as a breach of its handover agreements with Britain.The reason for this whole exercise is because of the legal vacuum caused by the NPC ... so we are inviting public comments on the proposals , Suen , secretary for policy coordination , told a news conference.Under the plans , societies and political parties would have to be registered and might be refused registration if they are known to have ties to or receive donations from foreign political organisations or individuals.People wishing to hold demonstrations would have to get permission from police seven days in advance.Demonstrations should only be staged after the police issue a notice of no objection .
Under the current system , the police need only be notified beforehand.Suen said the proposals complied with Hong Kong 's Basic Law , the post-handover constitution , and were above world standards.In working out the proposals , we adhere to the principle that they must be in full compliance with the Basic Law and consistent with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , Suen said.Echoing the well-worn words of his boss , Tung Chee-hwa , Suen also said the changes were necessary to strike a balance between civil liberties and social order.We must strike a balance between civil liberties and social stability , personal rights and social obligations , individual interests and the common good , Suen said.Within the generality of this commitment , we seek to establish broad consensus among the people of Hong Kong as to where the balance should lie.The public was invited to give comments on the plans in a pulse-taking exercise over the next three weeks , Suen said.Legislation drafted on the basis of the proposals will be enacted by a controversial China-anointed provisional legislature which replaces the elected Legislative Council on July 1.The departing colonial power Britain , some of its allies and Hong Kong democracy groups have attacked all the moves as a reversal of democratic freedoms in this territory of 6.4 million people.Under the Sino-British agreements on the handover , Hong Kong has been guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for 50 years .
A funeral cortege bearing the body of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping arrived at Beijing 's Babaoshan cemetery for cremation on Monday as China began paying last respects to the man who transformed the nation.A white van bedecked with black and yellow ribbons , the colours of mourning , carried Deng 's body at a stately pace on its last journey to the cemetery in western Beijing where Chinese communism 's heroes are traditionally laid to rest.Scatter Hot Tears for Comrade Xiaoping , read a banner with black characters and held up by a group of people outside the military hospital where Deng 's body has lain since he died last Wednesday aged 92.Hundreds of armed police , a fraction of the huge security force activated as China treads carefully along the road of political transition , lined streets along the 2.5-km ( 1.5-mile ) route to the cemetery.The cortege moved at a pace slightly faster than walking to allow thousands of mourners lining the route a last glimpse of the man who ruled China for 18 years with a unique mixture of capitalist-style policies under communist control.I have come to say goodbye to Deng Xiaoping , said one young man.As the cavalcade moved past , people stood on roofs of nearby buildings or climbed up lamp posts for a better view.But some local residents did not know Deng 's body was to be moved on Monday and were upset that their routine was disrupted.Hey , move it , some of us have to go to work , grumbled one middle-aged woman pushing her bicycle through the crowd.Outside Babaoshan stood hundreds of workers bused in from from the nearby steel works.One manager of the giant state-run enterprise , Yue Wenhui , 44 , asked why he was willing to wait outside on a wintry day , said : The weather is good .
It is as cloudy as our hearts.Deng , an early opponent of the leadership cult around his predecessor Chairman Mao Zedong , made clear he wanted his death to be followed by more restrained mourning than the near-hysteria that followed Mao 's demise in 1976.No foreign dignitaries have been invited to attend Tuesday 's memorial rites , to be held in Beijing 's Great Hall of the People .
Deng 's ashes will be scattered at sea.State media publicised a request by Deng 's family that his body not be put on display , his corneas be donated to an eye bank and his body offered for medical dissection before cremation.China has sought to present an image of stability and continuity in the aftermath of Deng 's death , painfully aware of the tumult that has often followed the death of strongmen throughout China 's history.Since his death authorities have heightened their security watch around the capital and especially in Tiananmen Square , the vast central space where , in 1989 , student-led protests were crushed by troops and tanks at Deng 's behest.So far , the public has seen a display of unanimity at the top of China 's communist power structure , with the supreme leader 's hand-picked successor , Jiang Zemin , vowing to keep China on the road of economic reform.But Chinese political analysts said cracks were appearing in the facade and Jiang , who holds the top state , party and military posts and is now the most powerful man in China , may be trying to throw his weight around too soon .
China has sounded an alarm over local authorities who kidnap and extort to protect regional interests , saying such actions are forms of corruption that are eating away at the power of the ruling Communist Party.Beijing , already in the throes of a fierce anti-corruption drive , would launch a nationwide crackdown on abuse of local power from April to June this year , said the weekly magazine Outlook in an edition issued in Beijing on Monday.The official magazine lashed out at regional authorities who protect local companies , who kidnap and extort and falsify books to safeguard local earnings.Many courts and law authorities give favourable judgments to local firms or offices in cases involving parties from other regions of China , it said.Most often their goal is to protect the interests of a local party to the case and some aim to obtain greater legal costs or financial returns , the magazine said.Such phenomena were a form of corruption and a result of growing individualism that threatens Communist Party rule.The nature of it is departmental selfishness , a mountain stronghold mentality and cliquism , and in the end it is closely linked to the everything-for-profit mentality of extreme individualism , the magazine railed.Such actions resulted in obstruction of central government decrees and seriously weakened both ruling Communist Party and state , it said.Chinese President and party chief Jiang Zemin has tried to stamp out abuse of official power , saying corruption is a virus that threatens the party 's 47-year grip on power.Analysts say the results of his anti-graft drive have been patchy at best , hampered by local officials who run virtual fiefdoms far from the centre of power in Beijing.Many regional authorities had illegally seized the bank funds or assets of firms from other regions operating in their localities .
Some had even resorted to kidnapping to extract money from outsiders , the magazine said.Most glaring is the method of illegally detaining hostages to demand payment of debts .
Some methods are abominable and the results extremely serious , Outlook said without elaborating.Lawyers and legal offices had committed serious ethical offences in bowing to the demands of local bosses by mishandling or pigeon-holing cases or by providing false evidence , it said.Some lawyers do not use facts as a foundation or the law as their yardstick and provide legal services for local departments trying to obtain illegal benefits , it said.Banks and other financial organs had often hindered legal investigations by creating false accounts or receipts to help local units evade inspection or debt , it said.Local firms or units that violated tax or customs laws could expect to be let off easy by officials , paying fines instead of facing criminal punishment or being slapped with more lenient penalties , it said.Some industrial , commercial and tax offices refuse to give information about local firms to other areas , or sometimes give out false information or supply fake evidence to help local enterprises evade responsibilities , it said .
China has vowed to smash plots aimed at disrupting stability in Xinjiang after a spate of bomb attacks which shook the far western region last month.Illegal religious groups and ethnic separatists were the main forces working to undermine social stability in the mostly Moslem region , said a commentary in the Xinjiang Daily seen in Beijing on Tuesday.We must maintain a high degree of vigilance for that very small number of bad people who endanger the security of the state and the public , jeopardise social stability and engage in violent terrorist activities , the commentary said in the official newspaper 's March 5 edition.Just let them show their heads and we will ... foil their plots and strike at their puffed-up arrogance , it said.The prominent front-page commentary followed a series of bomb attacks that killed nine and wounded 74 in the restive region last week.Three bombs planted on buses blew up within minutes of each other in the regional capital Urumqi on February 25 in an attack apparently coordinated to coincide with funeral rites in Beijing for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.A fourth bomb failed to explode.Another bomb blew up a bus in Beijing last week during rush hour , killing at least two people and injuring 30 , but Chinese officials said on Monday there was no evidence linking the deadly blast with the Urumqi attacks.The newspaper made no mention of any bombings but quoted a senior central government official from Xinjiang as saying authorities would win the battle against those who sought to destroy national unity.We have resolute faith in our victory over ethnic splittist activities , the newspaper quoted Ismail Amat , Minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission , as saying.There is no opportunity for splittist activities , which go against the tide of history and the wishes of peoples of all ethnic groups , Amat said .
Failure is inevitable.The Xinjiang Daily said last Wednesday an unspecified number of suspects were in custody for having made and planted the bombs , while others were thought to have sold detonators for the explosives.Exiled Uighur nationalists in the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan claimed responsibility last week for the bombings and said Chinese police had arrested at least 20 ethnic Uighurs in Urumqi and Yining near Xinjiang 's border with Kazakhstan.Chinese officials declined to comment on the arrests in the Xinjiang bombings , saying only that authorities were investigating.We are in the process of solving it , Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a regular news briefing on Tuesday.Moslem separatists want to set up an independent East Turkestan in Xinjiang , home to many Turkic-speaking people , including those of the Uighur ethnic minority.In early February , an anti-Chinese riot erupted in Yining in Xinjiang .
Chinese officials said nine people were killed in the riot -- one of the largest , most violent demonstrations for independence in Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover .
China and the United States have made headway in talks on Beijing 's accession to the World Trade Organisation , with Washington keen to move ahead at the start of President Bill Clinton 's second term , diplomats said on Monday.Visiting U.S. trade official Lee Sands held talks with his Chinese counterparts last week on Beijing 's long-stalled application for entry to the WTO and a Beijing-based diplomat said there was a sense of optimism both sides were making progress.We have not fixed any deadline yet but things are really moving with some momentum here and we very , very much want to have China in the organisation , the diplomat said.There is ... at their highest levels a recognition again that this is important to both of our interests , another diplomat said.China now had a golden opportunity to resolve the continuing dispute over its WTO entry because U.S. trade officials wanted to kick off Clinton 's second term with a major victory , the diplomat said.The more sort of politically savvy ( Chinese ) that we 've conversed with on WTO recognise that there is a year of real opportunity here , the diplomat said.These are moments that China would , in its own self interest , be well-advised to seize , he said.China 's entry into the global trade body has been an issue of intense bilateral debate , with Beijing seeking membership under the favourable terms accorded developing countries and Washington arguing its economy is too big for such special treatment.We can perhaps during the course of the next year work constructively to try and come up with something which would end this process and bring China into the WTO , the diplomat said.China failed in its bid to gain WTO membership at the inception of the world body in 1995 because of stiff resistance not only from the United States but also from Europe and Japan.Washington has said Beijing must comply with a road map , and issues still on the negotiating table included removal of non-tariff barriers , standardisation of customs procedures and elimination of subsidies to domestic industries , diplomats said.What you have to do is provide opportunities for industries to be able to trade fairly and on a level playing field , the second diplomat said.China 's trade surplus with the United States had swollen to about $ 38.9 billion in 1996 from about $ 34 billion in 1995 , he said .
Beijing says its figures show a net trade deficit with Washington.The growing trade gap has increasingly become a source of cross-Pacific friction , with U.S. industries demanding more access to the huge Chinese market as China 's economy continues to boom , the first diplomat said.While many senior Chinese officials were becoming more aware of the benefits WTO membership could bring to China , Beijing would have to be prepared to shoulder the responsibilities that came with being a world trade power.They become big players on a big stage , but you do n't do that irresponsibly , the first diplomat said .
Chinese authorities have imposed a curfew on a town in the restive northwestern Xinjiang region after at least 10 people were killed in a separatist Moslem riot last week , officials and local residents said on Monday.At least 10 people were killed and many wounded when about 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining last Wednesday , smashing cars , burning shops and beating up Han Chinese to protest against Beijing rule.Both Han Chinese and Uighurs were killed or injured , a propaganda official said by telephone from Yining in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture near the border with Kazakhstan.A Chinese source with close links to the government said the riot was among the most violent for many years in Xinjiang , where Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up just 38 percent of the population.A circular has been issued and broadcast on television ordering people not to go out after dark , said a Han resident.We do n't go out after the sun sets .
There is a curfew every night.We do n't dare to go out , said a Han businessman , adding that Yining was rocked by a similar , smaller riot in August.Officials described the riot as a small incident fuelled by foreign hostile forces and refused to say how many people were killed or wounded .
Yining is 50 km ( 30 miles ) from the border with Kazakhstan , where many exiled Uighur separatists live.However , the Chinese source said at least 10 people had been killed , including one police officer , and many wounded and arrested.One police officer was stabbed to death , said the source , who declined to be further identified.The riot erupted after a Chinese policeman tried to arrest a Uighur , he said .
The police tried to arrest a Uighur criminal suspect but the suspect and his family resisted arrest.The scene attracted neighbours and onlookers and the crowd swelled to more than 1,000 and turned into rioting , he said.The police were called in and fired teargas to dispel the crowd.Rioters attacked ethnic Han Chinese on sight , smashed cars and set fire to shops , forcing local authorities to send out about 1,000 police and paramilitary People 's Armed Police to quell the violence , the Han businessman said.Many people died , he said .
Probably some 100 people were wounded.Hong Kong 's Ming Pao newspaper said rioters set fire to the bodies of those killed.The demonstrators , shouting anti-Chinese slogans , had marched on a government building and police had asked them to disperse , said the propaganda official in Yining , about 700 km ( 440 miles ) northwest of the Xinjiang capital , Urumqi.There was a demonstration and they shouted slogans calling for Han Chinese to be driven out of Xinjiang and for Xinjiang to be split from the motherland , he said , adding that the rioters had used the pretext of religion.Xinjiang , considered by many Chinese as a wild frontier territory , has a long history of ethnic clashes between the native population of mainly Moslem ethnic minorities and the ruling Han Chinese.Xinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after a series of violent clashes , bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.Last May , Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang 's lengthy border to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states .
A South Korean official on Tuesday said progress had been made in talks with China over the fate of the most senior leader to flee Pyongyang but terms of his departure from Beijing were still undecided.Hwang Jang-yop , a senior North Korean ideologue and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il , has been stranded in Seoul 's mission in Beijing since February 12 while the three nations negotiate his fate.There has been some headway .
Negotiations are still going on , said Chang Moon-ik , spokesman for the South Korean embassy in Beijing.Officials in South Korea said on Monday they expected a breakthrough this week in talks with China aimed at securing Hwang 's passage out of Beijing but Chang said it was unlikely he would be moved in the next few days.Final arrangements have yet to be done first .
There has been no final decision , Chang said by telephone.Weeks of talks over Hwang 's fate , interrupted by the death of China 's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping last month , have failed to produce an accord as Beijing finds itself torn between an old communist ally and a new capitalist friend.We want to bring Mr Hwang to Seoul directly but if that is not possible we can make other arrangements , Chang said .
Korean sources have said Hwang may be whisked away to another country , possibly in Southeast Asia.Analysts say Hwang will likely end up in Seoul but Beijing is anxious to help North Korea save face by being seen to give due consideration to the hermit nation 's concerns.Hwang , chief architect of Pyongyang 's ruling ideology of Juche , or self-reliance , is the highest North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state.His defection has placed extra strains on ties between the two Koreas , arch-enemies since the 1950-53 civil war ended in an uneasy ceasefire.Armed Chinese police backed by armoured personnel carriers and a crowd control truck maintained a tight security cordon around Seoul 's consular compound where Hwang is holed up in Beijing 's normally sedate diplomatic quarter.Beijing has appealed to North and South Korea to stay calm during attempts to end the diplomatic standoff sparked by Hwang 's defection.Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last week Beijing was still investigating Hwang 's case and hoped for a solution as soon as possible.North Korea initially accused the South of kidnapping Hwang , then changed its hardline stance by saying if he really had defected he was a traitor and would be dismissed.Beijing , which sent its armies to fight on Pyongyang 's side during the Korean War , established diplomatic links with Seoul only in 1992 .
Talks between South Korea and China have failed to resolve the fate of a senior North Korean defector holed up for an eighth day in Seoul 's mission in Beijing , Seoul officials said on Wednesday.The impasse came despite signals from the Stalinist North that it might be ready to give up Pyongyang ideologue Hwang Jang-yop without a fight.Unfortunately , we have not made any real progress in our talks with China , South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung said of the drama centred on Hwang , who has sought asylum in Seoul 's heavily-guarded consular compound in Beijing.Lee denied a report by Japan 's Yomiuri newspaper that China and South Korea had basically agreed that Hwang could leave Beijing for asylum in South Korea as early as this week.The newspaper said Beijing had demanded a meeting with Hwang to confirm his desire to defect and had insisted on a signed promise from South Korean President Kim Young-sam pledging not to use the incident for political gain.It is too early to talk about when Hwang could leave Beijing , Lee said in Seoul.South Korean officials in Beijing said talks with Chinese officials were still going on but declined to comment on the content of the negotiations , saying only that a solution was expected to take some time.We have n't got any results so far , embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik said .
Embassy officials had not met counterparts from the North , he said.China had insisted Hwang 's case be resolved through dialogue between rivals South and North , a Seoul Foreign Ministry official said.We are telling the Chinese that there 's no dialogue channel and it is impossible to resolve a sensitive defection issue in direct talks with the North , said the official , who asked not to be identified.But with North Korea changing its attitude , we hope there will be progress in our negotiations , the official said.The Stalinist North has hinted it may be ready to give up attempts to win back Hwang , ranked 24th in the Pyongyang hierarchy and architect of its governing ideology of Juche , or strict self-reliance.North Korean leader King Jong-il appeared to indicate Pyongyang 's less hardline approach when he was quoted by state radio on Tuesday as saying cowards should get out.Another Japanese newspaper reported that a top North Korean official visiting Beijing had said Pyongyang would not fight the defection of Hwang , who sought refuge in Seoul 's Beijing mission last Wednesday.China , dragged as an unwilling third party into the latest crisis in the world 's last Cold War standoff , has repeated its plea to both countries to act with restraint to resolve the affair.Beijing is in a quandary over how to usher Hwang out of China without angering an old communist comrade or a new capitalist friend.China appeared nervous about Pyongyang 's intentions , sending three armoured personnel carriers , a crowd control truck and armed police to guard the sedate streets around the mission while officials seek an end to the impasse .
More and more Chinese suitors are using Valentine 's Day as an excuse to open their hearts to the ones they love but rose merchants reaping huge profits may be even more passionate about the traditional lovers ' day.Banned as bourgeois decadence in China 's ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution , Valentine 's Day has since emerged as an opportunity for shy lovers to make public expressions of affection -- and as a red-letter day for flower sellers.The Beijing Flower Supermarket , which supplies the capital with 80 percent of its fresh flowers , expects to see sales jump 400 percent on Valentine 's Day this year , said one salesman with a company affiliated with the market.I estimate the market will sell about one million flowers , Kong Li of the Beijing Huaxianzi Flower Delivery Co said in an interview .
Valentine 's Day is our most lively day.FROM RED BOOKS TO RED ROSESScenes of fanatical Red Guards waving little red books of Chairman Mao Zedong 's quotations have given way to a growing army of amorous youth bearing red roses , who are more passionate about the opposite sex than about the latest political pronouncements from Beijing.The Chinese love excitement and a reason to get worked up .
Valentine 's Day is an excuse to do that , Kong said.When there were no flowers , Chinese used other ways to express their feelings .
Now that we have fresh flowers more people like to give them as gifts , Kong said.Nearly two decades of market-oriented reforms launched by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping have mixed the forces of the market with those of the heart , with lucrative results for pedlars of petals.A budding flower industry emerged in China in the mid-1980s but it was n't until Deng put his seal of approval on the country 's capitalist-style reforms in 1992 that the sector really started to bloom , Kong said.Flowers have become more popular mainly because of the reforms and opening up , he said.A ROSE FOR HALF A WEEK 'S INCOMEFresh roses for Valentine 's Day are flown to wintry Beijing mainly from major growing areas around the southern boomtown of Guangzhou in Guangdong province and Kunming in the temperate southwestern province of Yunnan , Kong said.Many roses are also imported from the Netherlands , he said.Demand for roses on Valentine 's Day can send the price of a single flower soaring to 50 yuan ( $ 6.00 ) , or half a week 's income for an average urban resident.Beijing 's flower dealers normally purchase domestic roses for around five yuan each from southern growers but the price can jump as high as 15 yuan in the run-up to Valentine 's Day , Kong said.Retail prices can be more than double that by the time the flowers hit the stalls in Beijing.We can sell a Chinese rose for 25 yuan on Valentine 's Day .
Imported ones can sell for 50 yuan , he said .
An average city dweller made about 420 yuan a month in 1995.Flower sellers who rent stall space at the state-run flower market reap huge profits from the mark-ups.I can make 10,000 yuan in profit on a good day like Valentine 's Day , said Liu Cheng , manager of one stall.FASHIONABLY HIP YOUTH ARE GENEROUS LOVERSWhereas institutional buyers such as hotels and corporations made up the bulk of business in the past , ordinary residents with more money in their pockets are increasingly becoming the mainstay of the industry , Kong said.One guy last year bought 900 roses for Valentine 's Day , stall manager Liu said.Trend-conscious young people were sending more flowers to friends and relatives for birthdays and at the new year as well as on Valentine 's Day , Kong said.It 's mostly young people in their 20s , Kong said .
Most of those who buy flowers are well-educated and cultured.Kong predicted the Beijing flower market would double within three years , but hefty prices could be a thorn in the side for less well-off Chinese hoping to send their sweethearts a token of their affection.Fifty yuan a rose ?
I think I 'd give some chocolates instead , one Beijing resident said when asked if he would purchase flowers for his wife on Valentine 's Day .
( $ 1 = 8.3 yuan ) Chinese police cordoned off a South Korean embassy compound and North Korean diplomats waited outside as a senior Seoul official began talks in Beijing on the apparent defection of a top Pyongyang official.Kim Ha-jung , a special adviser to South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha , arrived in Beijing and sat down at once for talks with Chinese officials on the diplomatic crisis , South Korean embassy officials said.Chinese police blocked streets to Seoul 's consular section in the sedate , tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing , and embassy officials said Hwang Jang-yop , a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il , and his assistant were inside.Hwang , 73 , is one of the chief architects of North Korean communism , and would be the highest ranking official from the world 's last Stalinist state to seek asylum in the South.China avoided direct comment after finding itself in the eye of a diplomatic storm involving its old communist comrade , Pyongyang , and new commercial ally , Seoul , and chose instead to appeal for calm.Regarding the passage through Beijing city by Hwang Jang-yop , we were not notified in advance , a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.We hope the parties concerned can deal with this matter calmly and on the basis of the overall circumstances , and appropriately handle this in the interests of the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula , she said.In a sign of the suspicion that underscores dealings between North and South , South Korean embassy officials accused North Koreans of trying to force their way into the consular office and had called for Chinese police protection.Diplomats from Pyongyang sat in parked cars outside the consular compound and waited outside the embassy , watching from behind the police cordons.Last night , North Korean people who we believe were from the embassy tried to enter our consular section , embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik told reporters .
Chinese police on guard prevented the North Koreans from entering , he said.We have asked the Chinese government to protect our embassy compound ... against North Koreans and any unexpected ( incidents ) , he said.He dismissed Pyongyang 's charges that Hwang , one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea 's ruling Workers ' Party , had been kidnapped by the South , saying Hwang had voluntarily sought asylum.He came by taxi without any notice , Chang said.North Korean diplomats stood by the kidnapping charge.I think South Korea has kidnapped these two officials , said one of several North Korean officials waiting in the office tower housing Seoul 's embassy .
The impossible has happened.An official at the North Korean embassy repeated a Pyongyang Foreign Ministry statement that accused Seoul of kidnapping Hwang and urged Beijing to sort out the mess.If it is brought to light that the South Korean authorities kidnapped him and describe him as seeking 'asylum ' , we will regard it as a serious incident without precedent and take due countermeasures , the Korean Central News Agency quoted a Pyongyang Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.We expect that the Chinese side will take appropriate measures in this regard , the spokesman added.South and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953 .
China fought on North Korea 's side in the conflict .
Chinese authorities have imposed a curfew on a town in the mainly Moslem region of northwestern Xinjiang after at least 10 people were killed in a separatist riot last week , officials and local residents said on Monday.At least 10 people were killed and many wounded last Wednesday when 1,000 Moslem separatists of the Uighur ethnic minority rampaged through Yining , smashing cars , burning shops and beating up Han Chinese to protest against Beijing rule.Both Han Chinese and Uighurs were killed or injured , a propaganda official said by telephone from Yining in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture near the border with Kazakhstan.A Chinese source with close links to the government said the separatist riot was among the most violent for many years in Xinjiang , where Moslems are in the majority and ethnic Han Chinese make up just 38 percent of the population.A circular has been issued and broadcast on television ordering people not to go out after dark , said one local resident , a Han Chinese .
We do n't go out after the sun sets .
There is a curfew every night.Local officials described the riot as a small incident fuelled by unidentified foreign hostile forces and refused to say how many people had been killed or injured.However , the Chinese source said at least 10 people had been killed , including one police officer , and many wounded and arrested.One police officer was stabbed to death , said the source , who declined to be further identified.The Hong Kong-based Ming Pao newspaper said rioters set fire to the bodies of those killed .
About 100 were wounded , it said.The rioters attacked ethnic Han Chinese on sight , smashed cars and set fire to shops , forcing local authorities to send out about 1,000 police and paramilitary People 's Armed Police to quell the riot , one Han resident said.They said they wanted the Han out of Xinjiang , he said.The riot erupted after a Chinese policeman tried to arrest a man of the ethnic Uighur minority , the Chinese source said.The police tried to arrest a Uighur criminal suspect but the suspect and his family resisted arrest , the source told Reuters by telephone.The scene attracted neighbours and onlookers and the crowd swelled to more than 1,000 and turned into rioting , he said .
The police were called in and fired teargas to dispel the crowd.The demonstrators , shouting anti-Chinese slogans , had marched on a government building and police had asked them to disperse , said the propaganda official in Yining , about 700 km ( 440 miles ) northwest of the Xinjiang capital , Urumqi.There was a demonstration and they shouted slogans calling for Han Chinese to be driven out of Xinjiang and for Xinjiang to be split from the motherland , he said , adding that the rioters had used the pretext of religion.The festival to mark the end of Ramadan , the Moslem month of fasting , fell at the weekend , overlapping with China 's celebration of the biggest holiday in its calendar , the lunar new year , last Friday.Xinjiang , considered by many Chinese a wild frontier territory , has a long history of ethnic clashes between the native population of mainly Moslem ethnic minorities and the ruling Han Chinese .
NEC Corp 's NEC Computer Systems unit will on Monday launch a set of personal computers aimed at what it sees as a huge North American market of businesses with fewer than half a dozen employees.The computers , which will include the first customized for this market to include Intel Corp Pentium Pro processors and a special software bundle from Microsoft Corp , are aimed at the needs of small businesses .
They include APC uninterruptible power supplies , Iomega Corp Zip drives for storing onto 100 megabyte floppy disks , NEC Multispin 8X CD-ROM drives , telephone headsets with built-in microphones and stereo speakers.The four Ready Office models range in price from $ 2,199 to $ 2,999 and include processors ranging from the 133- or 166- megahertz Pentium to Intel 's 180-megahertz Pentium Pro.The target market , which NEC calls the Tiny Office/Home Office ( TOHO ) segment , is a subset of the Small Office/Home Office market targeted by many computer makers and includes a vast array of professionals and service businesses .
According to IDC/LINK data , NEC said , this group accounts for around 56 percent of the businesses with fewer than 100 employees in the United States , referred to in the computer industry as the SOHO , or Small Office/Home Office , market.Furthermore , NEC said in a white paper , the group will purchase 2.23 million computer units in 1996 , or some 40 percent of all units sold into the SOHO market.Accountants , florists , doctors , graphic designers , real estate agents , writers , restaurants and travel agents are among the businesses NEC aims to address .
NEC 's research found these one to five person businesses generally lack the corporate infrastructure found in larger operations , so often one personal computer-level machine must carry the weight of all the organization 's activities.TOHO business owners require computing solutions that will not only auotomate business processes , but assist them in managing the business as well , Timothy Chin , NEC Computer Systems senior product manager , wrote in a market report .
TOHO business owners need computing solutions that will help them to better wear each of their several hats , including those of president , chief financial officer , marketing professinal , MIS technician , business or legal advisory , even secretary , he said.In TOHO companies , the computer is the busineess -- without it core activities would come to a screeching halt .
Steffanee White , a product manager at NEC Computer Systems here , said in an interview that NEC had taken a bottom-up approach to designing its products for the TOHO market , stripping out unnecessary features like high-end audio and graphics or computer games and children 's educational titles.Through a partnership with Microsoft , NEC said it will be the first to include on its machine the combination of Windows 95 with a business software suite incorporating Word , Excel and Publisher 97 and special Excel and Word templates .
The computers are also fitted with Peachtree First Accounting , Microsoft Schedule+ , Money , Bookshelf and Automap Streets , in addition to voicemail , fax , e-mail and Novell Inc network certification , the company said.For the reseller channel , the company will ship four roughly equivalent PowerMate Office models ranging in price from $ 2,100 to $ 3,200 , with the high-end PowerMate Office Pro 2620 running the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 operating system.NEC said the products will be available by mid-October.System prices do not include monitors , it said .
Intel Corp. executives said late Tuesday the company has agreed to invest cash and technical know-how in a new company to deliver multimedia content by satellite to personal computers across Europe.Intel said the investment , to be formally announced at the CeBIT technology trade fair in Hannover , Germany , on Wednesday , will be Intel 's first investment in personal computer delivery services , although it has sought to foster other technologies that can help drive the use of personal computers worldwide.Intel will hold a minority stake in the newly formed European Satellite Multimedia Services S.A. ( ESM ) , said Leslie Vadasz , Intel senior vice president and director of corporate business development.Europe has a lot of satellite use , so it was an obvious place , to begin such a service , Vadasz told Reuters .
There is a need to provide a new kind of service for PC users.Industry sources valued the Intel investment at $ 15 million , with Luxenbourg 's Societe Europeenne des Satellite ( SES ) holding a majority stake in the new company , which will also be based in Luxenbourg.Intel executives declined to comment on the cash value of the deal , but said the company would also be contributing technology to the endeavor , and hopes to bring in partners capable of supplying multimedia content to the venture.Part of our contribution will be technology .
Part of it will be our relationship with many of our customers , content and media companies , Vadasz said in an interview.Other investors are expected to be announced in the near future , he said .
Negotiations with prospective investors aere under way , he said , but he declined to elaborate.The new company will launch ASTRA-NET , a system for communications using SES 's ASTRA satellite system already in place .
The first business-to-business communications links will be operational in the second half of this year.ESM is expected to eventually bring PC services to European homes much as increasingly popular satellite television services , like BSkyB , have done for TV.Intel noted that more than 16 million personal computers bought in Europe last year , according to the research firm Dataquest , and 23 million European households have direct access to ASTRA satellite transmissions.ASTRA-NET reception throughout Europe will require 50-60 centimeter satellite dish , less than two feet in diameter , connected to a PC equipped with a high-performance Intel Pentium microprocessor and a PC card which is compatible with Europe 's Digital Video Broadcasting ( DVB ) transmissions.Intel said business data can be sent to servers at speeds up to 38 megabits per second , well above the 56 kilobit speeds of leading-edge telephone modems or the 128 kilobits per second rates of Integrated Digital Services Network ( ISDN ) .Speeds of six megabits per second to the home will be possible , with technology likely to be available by the year 2000 which could enable two-way satellite traffic.At first , traffic will be broadcast-only , however , with the capcity to send data and multimedia programming at speeds hundreds of times faster than over conventional phones.As satellite technology moves along , there 's be more and more opportunity to do an on-demand type of service , such as higher-speed Internet browsing .
Initially , this will be a push technology only.Vadasz said Intel 's work on developing technology for cable modems and on Ethernet local area network ( LAN ) adapters can be brought to bear in the project .
Intel also has been working on a wireless data standard dubbed Intercast.Vadasz has argued that PC communications have lagged wellbehind other technologies , stating in a recent editorial letter to the San Jose Mercury News that such services could result in more than $ 10 billion in annual U.S. sales alone.To foster such a market , he wrote , higher bandwidth connections with instant access , multimedia integration , security and affordable pricing were necessary features .
( ( sam.perry @ reuters.com , Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400 ) ) Microsoft Corp Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold said Tuesday that contributions to new products from its basic research arm prompted its decision to triple the size of the group.Research has made very material contributions , so much so that we have decided to triple it , Myhrvold said of the company 's plans , announced previously , to triple the size of its research staff from 180 currently.Myhrvold told Reuters in an interview that every major Microsoft product line now includes features that began in its five-year-old research labs , including the grammar checker and help system in its new Office 97 products.Microsoft has budgeted a whopping $ 2 billion for its research and development spending in its current fiscal year to June 30 , 1997 , although by far the lion 's share of that goes towards product development and marketing.Microsoft Research receives between one and two percent of the overall budget , or between $ 20 million and $ 40 million now , and Myhrvold said the company wants to increase this by a factor of three to about five percent.Myhrvold and Rick Rashid , vice president of Advanced Technology and Research at Microsoft , said Microsoft 's commitment to basic research in proportion to its industry could soon surpass longer-standing laboratories , like Bell Labs , which is now part of Lucent Technologies.A major benefit of the research laboratories is the amount of research the company can weave into its intellectual property portfolio.One example of research under way at Microsoft is speech recognition and synthesis.Gordon Bell , an eminent computer scientist who works in Microsoft 's San Francisco-based research group , noted in a talk to the Association for Computing Machinery here the technology has taken decades to develop.Myhrvold said effective speech applications are now still three to five years away , but added this can now be estimated based on evolutionary improvements on current research , rather than speculation over new breakthroughs.The Microsoft technologist says he was concerned the overwhelming enthusiasm over the Internet could subside if expectations become too high , although he added most of the dramatic Internet innovations still lie in the future.There 's going to be a wave that makes the current use of the World Wide Web pale in comparison , he added.Myhrvold added that software companies will continue to innovate and drive sales of hardware by producing software needing more powerful PCs.One day , the process of technical innovation will also create machines to rival human intelligence , he added.It 's pretty likely that we 'll invent computers that are as smart as we are , he said.When you tell people that a machine might be smarter than they are , they get tremendously insecure and threatened , he noted .
But my car is faster than I am and I do n't feel threatened or jealous of my car .
( ( sam.perry @ reuters.com , Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400 ) ) Novell Inc. Tuesday named Eric Schmidt , a prime architect of Sun Microsystems Inc. 's Internet and Java language strategy , as its chairman and chief executive officer.Schmidt , who will join Novell April 7 , will be charged with re-energising the network software company , which has been involved in a head-to-head battle with software giant Microsoft Corp..Over the last 18 months , Novell has managed to dispose of software applications WordPerfect and Quattro Pro , which had been acquired by former Novell chief executive officer Ray Noorda in a failed effort take on industry leader Microsoft.Analysts and industry executives , some of whom were startled by the move , said Schmidt had the energy and intellect to help hone the company 's strategy and to draw talented but scarce developers to its ranks.A lot of guys want to ride at the front , one analyst said of Schmidt 's move to the chief executive position.Schmidt , who joined Sun in 1983 as a manager of software , said the opportunity to run Novell would fulfil a lifelong dream of heading up a company in the industry.In recent months , Schmidt has emerged as a main spokesman for development of the Internet and of Sun 's effort to promote the Java language , designed to enable software to run on virtually all computer systems.These skills will be critical at Novell , analysts said , where former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chairman John Young has been serving as chairman since last August when former Novell CEO Robert Frankenberg stepped down , just as the company was gearing up a new Internet focus.Young will move to the post of vice-chairman.Chris Le Tocq , an industry analyst at Dataquest , said Schmidt will bring the vision Novell has been lacking.Despite facing competitive pressure from Microsoft , Novell still has the No .
1 market share in network operating systems.Joe Marengi , Novell 's president and chief operating officer who was serving as acting CEO since Frankenberg 's departure , said Novell currently claims 60 million users worldwide.I think it 's a very defensible position and , in fact , one that we can grow very rapidly , in my personal view , Schmidt said of Novell 's market position.In addition to competing with Microsoft in advanced networking features , Schmidt said the company will work to make sure its software works well on both Microsoft 's Windows NT and Unix networking environments.Schmidt received a degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University and a doctorate in computer science from the University of California at Berkeley .
He has worked at Xerox Corp. 's Palo Alto Research Centre , at Bell Laboratories and Zilog Inc. E*Trade Group Inc President and Chief Executive Christos Cotsakos said the company continues to increase its subscribers by eight to ten percent per month , with some days at higher rates.We are growing between 8 and 10 percent a month , Cotsakos said in a presentation to investors at Robertson , Stephens & amp ; Co 's Tech 97 Agenda investment conference.E*Trade is fresh from its initial public offering in August 1996 .
The company 's stock closed up 2-3/4 at a record closing high of 22-1/8 , after reaching an all-time mark of 22-7/8 earlier in the day.Investors and analysts said a deal with Microsoft Corp in which E*Trade 's share trading service will be integrated into Microsoft 's online investment service , investor.com , had helped boost the shares.Like many of the companies presenting here , analysts see strong rationale for continued growth for specific companies like E*Trade as the Internet space expands and draws businesses onto the World Wide Web.There 's a lot of momentum behind them , Robertson Stephens & amp ; Co analyst Catherine Baker , who covers Internet service and commerce sectors along with information companies , said of E*Trade.While the Palo Alto-based electronic brokerage company has been averaging 550 new accounts a day representing about $ 10 million in assets , Cotsakos said the company has had at least one day when it signed up 1,200 new customers with assets of $ 22 million.Cotsakos noted that the company 's percentage of total daily retail share trading volume had risen from 1/10 of 1 percent in 1995 to 0.7 percent of daily volume.E*Trade processes some 7,000 daily transactions over the Internet , which represents approximately half its total volume , with telephone calls making up around a quarter of volume and the rest coming from direct dial modems and from gateways such as America Online.E*Trade earlier announced it had struck a deal with Microsoft Corp in which customers of Microsoft 's Microsoft network MSN and its Microsoft Money product will be able to access E*Trade for trading.Cotsakos said E*TradeFs customer assets have risen from $ 800 million two years ago to $ 3 billion currently , a compound annual growth rate of 208 percent.He also noted that investors that sign up with E*Trade trade on average around 25 times a year , o roughly six times more than usual investors using a discount broker.Cotsakos said E*Trade will be adding further news services as well as upgrading its telephone services with voice recognition technology .
The company also plans to expand to Japan , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Britain this year.Cotsakos declined to discuss upcoming financial results .
Baker said , however , that she estimates E*Trade 's revenue could be $ 1 to $ 3 million ahead of projections in its current quarter , or 10-15 percent above expectations.Baker 's estimate for the current , second fiscal quarter had been for the company to report $ 0.07 a share profit on revenues of $ 27 million.Baker said the upside surprise would track with currently strong market trading volumes , adding the company 's growth would track well as long as the overall stock market continues to be strong , driving volumes up.The analyst said the most important strategic move for E*Trade now would now be to add trading of mutual funds.Nearly 400 companies are due to make presentations at the Robertson Stephens & amp ; Co. technology conference in presentations spread over five days this week .
( ( sam.perry @ reuters.com , Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400 ) ) USWeb Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Joe Firmage on Monday said the fast-growing Internet services company had launched the second stage of its business plan , agreeing to acquire affiliates in six U.S. metropolitan areas.Firmage , who started the Santa Clara-based company just 13 months ago , said the second phase of the plan called for the expansion of its corporate-owned operations .
He said USWeb would also expand outside the United States , particularly in Southeast Asia and Japan , by the end of October .
Next year , USWeb will concentrate on profitability , he said .
In January 1998 the focus is on leveraging what we built , Firmage said in an interview in Palo Alto.He said the company was seeking to achieve economies of scale in the market for services related to building Internet sites and intranets -- internal corporate computer networks that take advantage of inexpensive Internet technologies.Firmage said USWeb in its first phase succeeded in building a string of franchises in 54 locations in 26 states , including recent affiliates in Austin , Texas. , Seattle , Pittsburgh , and Irving and Laguna Hills , Calif .
The chief executive said USWeb had also succeeded in building a strong name and thus a currency for expansion .
A recent study rated USWeb third among information technology executives for brand awareness , behind AT & amp ; T Corp and MCI Communications Corp , he said.Firmage said the company was close to arranging a second round of financing .
Last year , USWeb raised $ 17 million from Softbank Corp of Japan and Crosspoint Ventures , which valued USWeb at $ 31 million , he said .
Firmage declined to project the size of any new investment.By next year , the company 's expansion should help USWeb become broad and deep and profitable , he said , declining to elaborate on expected profit margins.Firmage said more than 50 percent of USWeb 's business was the $ 50,000 to $ 1 million range of companies setting up business-critical sites for department-sized operations .
That work , and even much of the business of setting up enterprise-wide sites ranging in value from $ 500,000 to $ 3.0 million , is below the horizon of some of the bigger high-technology consulting firms , he added.Firmage said Internet technologies accounted for an increasing share of the $ 20 billion information technology out-sourcing market.The affiliates that USWeb is acquiring are in Washington , San Francisco , the New York City area , Orange County , Calif. , Philadelphia , and Milwaukee.Firmage declined to discuss when or whether the company may consider an initial public stock offering .
But , he said , with the current moribund IPO market and declining share prices , the private market is the place to be right now.Meanwhile , acquisition offers the owners of its franchises a way of creating some liquidity in their holdings , he said.There 's no question that this does open the possibility of liquidity , he said .
We have a liquidity path.USWeb 's operations now encompass some 400 to 500 people .
The company will hold its semiannual affiliate meeting , known as Velocity , in San Francisco next week .
( ( sam.perry @ reuters.com , Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400 ) ) In the next half century , computers will be ubiquitous in the home , waking us up to cheerful songbirds , making the morning coffee , filling the bathtub and driving us to work , according to leading computer scientists.In fact , advances in computer imaging and communications known as telepresence may eliminate the need to drive anywhere to hold business meetings and conferences , several scientists told the Association for Computing Machinery 's 50th anniversary exposition and convention here.The theme of the three-day convention in the heart of Silicon Valley was to predict the progress of computing in the year 2047 , 50 years from now.People will expect that when you wake up in the morning , you should be able to talk to your house , said Vinton Cerf , the scientist often described as the father of the Internet.Pervasive use of computer chips and smart electronic sensors will link everything from the refrigerator , which can be automatically locked to help a dieter 's self discipline , to intelligent toilets , already available in Japan , that can analyse human waste to produce routine health reports , he said.Three leading scientists - former Digital Equipment Corp. researcher Gordon Bell , Hewlett-Packard Co. research head Joel Birnbaum , and Microsoft Corp. Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold -- predicted computers will rival human intelligence in the next half-century.A person could spend the first 40 years of life doing everything possible , then spend the rest of life reliving the sensations , Birnbaum speculated .
Or one could chose to adapt the taste buds of a connoisseur.Just days after reports emerged from Scotland of the successful cloning of a sheep , an eclectic group of some of the world 's most advanced thinkers in science , technology and the arts said biology may also hold keys to the future of the most advanced computing devices.For example , Birnbaum described how synthetic DNA strands could theoretically be used one day to create biological computing devices in which the DNA contained in one test-tube could compute one billion billion operations at once.Birnbaum said it was difficult to know if this could be achieved in the next 50 years , but it was theoretically feasible .
He said quantum computing , in which calculations are made using subatomic particles , and optical computing also were promising areas.Myhrvold said software development also could move towards software that could re-generate itself for new purposes.But the experts also warned that eminent technologists in the past have also made very mistaken assumptions.Bell noted that International Business Machines Corp. 's Thomas Watson , Sr. , had predicted when the first general purpose computers were being designed in the mid-1940s that the world would need no more than five computers in total.Digital 's founder , Ken Olsen , projected in 1977 there would never be a reason for using computers in the home.Now roughly one-third of U.S. households have personal computers and computing devices are used in devices from dish washers to automobiles.On the other hand , many people thought voice recognition would advance far more quickly than it has.Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Pattie Maes described how software agents can already be used at the MIT Media Lab to determine whether there 's enough milk in the fridge or alert you if the value of your stock portfolio has plummeted.Maes described software agents under development like Kasbah , which will be available from MIT soon and buys or sells items such as personal computers electronically.The first 50 years was largely about hardware .
My guess is the next 50 years is going to be about software , said John Sainson , general manager of International Business Machines Corp. 's applications solutions unit .
( ( sam.perry @ reuters.com , Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400 ) ) Netscape Communications Corp. on Wednesday raised the ante in the Internet software wars , announcing a price increase effective April 1 as it prepares to release new products this spring.Netscape also introduced a five-level support program , beginning next month , which allows customers to pick the level of service they are willing to pay for.The price of Communicator , the integrated communications package which includes Netscape 's Navigator browser , will rise to $ 59 from $ 49 , the Mountain View , Calif.-based company said .
Its enterprise server software , used on the server computers that run networks , will cost $ 1,295 , up from $ 995.Under the new pricing , Netscape will charge an average 10 percent to 15 percent more for service , it said.But , by delaying the price increases until April 1 , Netscape has made a pre-release version of Communicator a more attractive buy and positioned itself for higher sales this quarter , executives said.People who pay now for the software , which is available in a preview version , will be able to get the final version for free when it becomes available in the next quarter.Michael Homer , Netscape 's vice president of marketing , said the new prices still offer a better deal than rival products from Microsoft Corp. and the Lotus Development Corp. unit of International Business Machines Corp..Lotus President Jeff Papows quickly challenged that and accused Netscape executives of childish behavior in making pricing comparisons that Papows said were misleading.There 's very little difference in the price points , actually , Papows said after making a presentation to a Goldman Sachs conference at which Netscape 's vice president of engineering , Eric Hahn , disclosed the price increases.Our servers are much cheaper to acquire , he said , noting that Lotus Domino server software is priced at $ 2,995 compared with Netscape 's SuiteSpot 3.0 , which allows customers to chose five of its nine server products for $ 3,995 , or $ 4,995 after April 1.A Microsoft executive also disputed Netscape 's pricing claim.Our browser and our server are still free , so we 've got to be less expensive , said Mike Nash , a marketing director in the company 's personal and business systems group.Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser is free for all platforms , and its Internet Information Service is included as a feature of the Windows NT Server operating systems for large networks.The three companies are competing fiercely in the fast-growing market for electronic mail , scheduling and so-called workgroup software for intranets , the corporate networks that make use of cost-effective Internet technologies.Netscape stock rose 87.5 cents to $ 35.625 , and Microsoft climbed $ 1.375 to $ 99.875 , both on the Nasdaq market .
IBM rose 12.5 cents to $ 144.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.Homer said a configuration for 1,000 users combining Communicator and Netscape 's server software only costs $ 58 per user computer -- just $ 23 a user for those already using Navigator -- compared to $ 77 for Lotus.But Papows contested this , saying the true list price figure would be around $ 58 , or roughly the same.They are quoting irrelevent data , doing it deliberately , and posting it to their Web site , he said , adding he recently discussed his concerns with Homer and Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale.The Lotus executive added , however , that he expects the market for all players to continue to expand briskly , with Lotus aiming to increase the number of electronic mail users of its software by up to 8.5 million this year to 18 million.We 're doing enormously well .
I suspect they 're doing well , too .
There 's a big market , he said , adding Netscape ought to be well credited for invigorating the Internet market.Homer said Netscape 's price advantage was even greater , according to recent studies by third parties , when the total cost of acquiring , installing and using its systems was taken into account , including training and other factors .
Apple Computer Inc. 's chief scientist said the company is seeking to generate outside investment in its Newton computer group , especially for its hot eMate product.Apple Chief Scientist Larry Tesler also told Reuters in an interview here late Thursday that Apple is looking to find new homes for at least a dozen technology projects it recently decided to stop funding.The Newton unit was spared the ax in last month 's restructuring , despite speculation it would be scrapped.Indeed , although early versions of the highly-touted Newton fell short of the mark four years ago , Tesler said Apple is getting rave reviews for its latest offerings.Demand for its eMate , a version of the Newton in a stylish clamshell case with a keyboard for schoolchildren and priced around $ 800 , was particularly strong , he said.A small group of Apple executives have been charged with exploring alternatives to increase investment in the Newton business while the company is slashing spending elsewhere in a bid to return to profits , he said.Tesler declined to talk about individual companies which Apple may have approached , and said he is not directly involved in the group 's day-to-day efforts , but that they had entered the process with an open mind.The group was prepared to consider a broad set of options , he said , although he would not say specifically whether these could include a joint venture or some sort of manufacturing or distribution deal , for example.We are pleased by the reception for the eMate and looking at how we can increase our investment in it at the same time as we lower expenses of the company , he said.Apple 's lead scientist said talk of scaling back or exiting the Newton business , which helped Apple pioneer the handheld computer market despite its bumpy start , was off target at a time when it 's just hitting its stride.In mid-March , Apple set out to cut spending by an average of 25 percent across the company while abandoning support for an array of technologies in its research labs.Apple has said it would cut a total of 4,100 jobs and take a $ 155 million restructuring charge in the second quarter to the end of March .
Apple is due to report its second quarter results on April 16.Tesler said Apple was looking for ways to keep its discontinued work alive by licensing it , for example , to third parties so these technologies can come to market.They 're not ones that fit our business model , but they 're ones that we think are good and ought to come to market , he said .
We have one or two dozen technologies that Apple has decided to discontinue and ( it is seeking to farm them out ) rather than seeing them wither.Tesler declined to give details on what these further technologies were , other than the outline given last month in the company 's restructuring announcement , and he said the method of seeking new sponsors to further develop and market the technologies would differ according to each.Tesler was attending the Sixth International World Wide Web Conference in Santa Clara , where he gave a presentation to a crowded audience on some of the hottest new Internet technology for use on Apple systems.Speculation that Apple might part with its Newton division re-emerged on Thursday after USA Today reported Apple was in talks with Sun Microsystems Inc. over the possibility Sun might buy the Newton unit.The newspaper reported Sun could be a tough bargainer and said no deal was imminent .
Neither Tesler , Apple nor a spokesman for Sun Microsystems would comment on the report .
Sun said it does not comment on speculation.Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy said last week he would not comment on acquisition rumors , including those about Apple .
He said that in general Sun will remain opportunistic in evaluating any deals that come its way.Earlier this year Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. ( ARM ) , which makes the speedy processors used in the Newton eMate and Apple 's recently launched MessagePad 2000 , said ARM was working with Sun 's Javasoft unit to make an operating system based on Java technology run on the ARM platform .
( ( sam.perry @ reuters.com , Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400 ) ) Intel Corp. , the world 's biggest maker of computer chips , said Tuesday its workers received about $ 820 million in cash bonuses , profit sharing and retirement pay for the company 's record year in 1996.The average employee received a minimum of about 33 percent payout over their base salary for the year -- about four months of extra income , Intel Chief Operating Officer Craig Barrett told reporters in a conference call.For an entry-level hourly worker earing $ 25,000 a year , the combined package of added compensation and benefits for last year amounts to roughly $ 8,000 extra , Intel said.We think it 's also been a phenomenal benefit to our shareholders by motivating our employees to do the best possible job they can for our shareholders and our customers , said Barrett , who will become Intel 's president this spring.Intel said the $ 820 million in 1996 cash profit-sharing and retirement contributions exceeded the company 's total 1981 revenues and was roughly equal to its 1991 net income.Profits at the Santa Clara-based semiconductor company , which supplies the microprocessors used in four out of every five personal computers shipped , last year soared to $ 5.2 billion as revenues hit $ 20.8 billion.Barrett said he did not begrudge employees any of the extra benefits from contributing to record results , and the company now plans to make all its employees eligible for stock options beginning with its next plan , which starts in April.This outstanding year would not have been possible without the remarkable efforts of Intel employees around the world , said Barrett , heir apparent to Intel CEO Andy Grove.Intel ended 1996 with a workforce of around 48,500.Separately , Intel Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant told an investment conference in New York City that Intel remained on track in the first quarter to meet its financial targets , as personal computer unit sales continue to grow.The stock of Intel closed up 12.5 cents at $ 151.75 on the Nasdaq market , where it was third most heavily-traded.Barrett said the company last year paid out $ 214 million , or the equivalent of 26.9 days ' salary for each Intel employee , under the Employee Cash Bonus Program .
All employees receive the cash profit-sharing in six-month installments.In 1996 , the company also extended its Employee Bonus profitability-based program to all employees .
The plan , based on growth in Intel earnings and achievement of an employee 's business group goals , paid out a total of $ 360 million.A one-time bonus marking Intel 's record-breaking year paid $ 1,000 to each U.S. employee and a locally adjusted figure to each non-U.S. employee , or a total of $ 45 million.Intel said that for the ninth consecutive year it contributed the maximum allowed by law to its employee retirement program , or 12.5 percent of employees ' pay -- a figure which totaled about $ 200 million.Intel has sought to build one of the corporate world 's most innovative compensation and benefits packages as a way of attracting top employees and to reward them for contributing to the company 's long-term growth and profitability.Intel , whose shares have vaulted 180 percent in the past year despite moribund results at many rival semiconductor companies , said it was one of only a small number of companies to have instituted an across-the-board options plan.Even the lowest-level hourly workers will receive options to buy a minimum of 50 shares in a five-year plan in which the employee gains one-fifth of the allotment each year .
Barrett said Intel also spends roughly 6 percent to 7 percent of its payroll , or around $ 150 million , on employee training each year to help employees advance in their careers.Barrett said Intel 's generous compensation plan and the hardships at other companies resulted in lower jobs turnover last year .
He declined to specify the exact turnover rate , but said We 're in the relatively low single-digit range .
China on Tuesday introduced rules governing direct shipping links with Taiwan , ignoring a decades-old ban by the island it regards as a renegade province.The regulations , which take effect from Tuesday , allow only wholly Chinese-owned or Taiwan-owned shipping companies or joint ventures involving Chinese or Taiwanese shipowners to sail between the two sides , Xinhua news agency said.Hong Kong 's Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po newspaper said the southeastern Chinese cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou would be the first ports to be opened to direct shipping links with Taiwan.The conditions for ( establishing ) direct shipping links are ripe , the newspaper said.Taiwan 's Nationalist government has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek 's Nationalist troops lost the Chinese civil war to the communists and fled to the island.With tensions easing since the late 1980s , civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in a third country or territory such as the British colony of Hong Kong or Portuguese-run Macau .
Taiwanese businessmen , who have poured more than $ 20 billion into China , are eager for direct transport links , but Taiwanese authorities have been reluctant to lift the ban.The Nationalists , who say they are committed to reunification with China , see direct transport links as their last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.China has threatened to invade if the island seeks independence.Under the regulations , shipping companies must apply with the Chinese Ministry of Communications for permission to ply routes between the two sides .
The rules made no mention of any need to seek approval from Taiwan authorities.The ministry has 45 days to decide whether to allow a shipping company to sail between the two sides , according to the regulations.The rules empower the ministry to warn and seize the unlawful income of shipping companies breaking the rules.China has poured cold water on a proposal by Taipei to turn Taiwan 's Kaohsiung into an extraterritorial port , allowing third party ships to ply routes between the two sides .
The Taipei-based Economic Daily News said on Tuesday Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui had urged the central bank to study how to control capital outflows to China in a further bid to limit the island 's economic exposure on its main rival 's turf .
The central bank denied the report.Speculation that Taipei might change its China policy has mounted since Lee cautioned last week that the island 's economy needed to avoid over-dependence on the mainland.The Chinese are not really making much progress on other fronts ...
They have decided to focus on the three links and apply pressure on the Taiwanese , a Western diplomat in Beijing said .
The three links refer to trade , transport and mail.On the diplomatic front , the rivalry has intensified , analysts say , with China trying hard to isolate the island and limit its contacts with other states.Taiwan state-funded television said Vice-President Lien Chan was visiting the former Soviet republic of Ukraine , which formally recognises Beijing .
The Ukraine has denied the report.China announced a diplomatic coup on Monday , persuading the West African nation of Niger to switch recognition to Beijing .
In imperial China , executions were carried out by skinning , quartering , chopping a man in half at the waist or even decapitating an entire clan.From January 1 , 1997 , the People 's Republic of China adds lethal injection as a means of executing death row convicts .
Currently , all executions are by firing squad.However , more modern means of execution do not necessarily mean waning enthusiasm for capital punishment.Crime is worsening ... and the Communist Party is obsessed with security , a Chinese political scientist who spoke on condition of anonymity said.The party believes in using draconian laws against disorder , the political scientist said.With a string of new laws in recent years and thousands of executions a year , the party is clearly not squeamish.The National People 's Congress , or parliament , is debating amendments to the Criminal Law to increase the number of crimes punishable by death , Chinese jurists said .
The amendments are due to be passed by a full session of parliament in March.In the face of soaring crime , China executed at least 1,000 people in just the first two months of its Strike Hard anti-crime crackdown launched last April , the London-based human rights watchdog Amnesty International said .
Thousands more executions may have gone unreported.Crime , virtually eliminated in the years after the puritan communists swept to power in 1949 , has staged a revival in the past two decades in the wake of liberal economic reforms .
Capital punishment is one means China chooses to try to deter violence.RISING EXECUTIONSAmnesty International recorded 3,612 death sentences and 2,535 executions in China in 1995 compared with 2,496 death sentences and 1,791 executions in 1994 .
Some 300 people were executed in the United States between the re-introduction of the death penalty in 1977 and January , 1996.It 's killing the chicken to frighten the monkey , one jurist said , quoting a Chinese proverb.Amnesty International said the figures were believed to fall far short of the actual number of death sentences and executions.Justice Ministry officials declined requests for an interview .
Police declined to comment.China does not publish statistics about the death penalty , saying these are a state secret.Despite criticism from groups such as Amnesty International , capital punishment seems to be in China to stay.It 's impossible for China to abolish the death penalty in the next 20 years , Yu Quanyu , vice-president of the China Society for Human Rights Studies , said.The introduction of lethal injection as a means of execution was contained in amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law that took effect on January 1.Currently , capital punishment is carried out at execution grounds with a single bullet fired at close range into the heart or back of the head with the convict kneeling , his ankles manacled and hands tied behind his back.Chinese and foreign jurists were divided over China 's motives for introducing lethal injection and allowing executions to be staged inside prisons.I strongly suspect ... they are making it even more convenient to harvest organs from executed prisoners for transplant purposes , Robin Munro of Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong.Medical facilities can be set up inside prisons to harvest organs , Munro said.Chinese dissidents living in exile have accused China of timing executions of death row convicts to coincide with the need for transplants of organs , often for sale.China vehemently denies the charge.Chinese jurists argued that the introduction of lethal injection and allowing executions behind prison walls were intended to curb waste of police manpower -- not to mention increasing logistical difficulties in finding shooting grounds.SUPERSTITIOUS VILLAGERSIt is difficult to find execution grounds , another jurist said .
Superstitious villagers protest against executions on their land.Many executions were held at military target ranges and along river banks , requiring huge police manpower to escort death row convicts and to stand guard to keep away curious onlookers.Chinese laws do not specifically state the site of execution grounds.Currently , death row convicts can not be executed inside prisons because it is regarded as inhumane for other inmates to hear the sound of gunfire , jurists said.The use of lethal injection would be quiet -- and save on manpower , they said.But Chinese jurists were doubtful whether death row convicts would be given a choice between the bullet and lethal injection .
A court in southwest China sentenced at least five dissidents to prison terms of up to 10 years for subversion , a human rights watchdog group said on Saturday.At least eight other dissidents were rounded up in Guiyang , capital of Guizhou province , in the same case , the New York-based Human Rights in China said.An unknown number of the eight were sentenced , the group said .
Details were not available.The Guiyang Intermediate People 's Court sentenced the five dissidents in May , 1996 , but Human Rights in China said it was not able to confirm their convictions until recently.There were many people involved .
The place was remote ... It took a lot of time to verify the facts , Xiao Qiang , executive director of Human Rights in China , told Reuters by telephone.The convictions could not be indepenently confirmed .
Court officials and police could not be reached for comment.Two of the political activists , Lu Yongxiang and Huang Zhongmin , were arrested in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square on June 4 , 1995 -- the sixth anniversary of a bloody military crackdown on student-led demonstrations for democracy -- while distributing copies of a daring , open letter to Communist Party leaders , the group said.Lu , 50 , a veteran dissident , and Huang , 35 , a businessman , were each sentenced to five years in prison for participating in a counter-revolutionary group , spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.Chen Xi , 42 , a lecturer-turned-businessman , received the harshest sentence -- 10 years in prison -- for organising and leading a counter-revolutionary group.The open letter demanded the ruling Communist Party lift a decades-old ban on the establishment of new political parties and newspapers and draft a new constitution guaranteeing independence of the judiciary , democratic elections and freedom of the press.In the letter , the dissidents threw their weight behind Zhao Ziyang , who was deposed as Communist Party chief in a power struggle that followed the 1989 crackdown.Zhao is under virtual house arrest , sources close to him have said .
He dropped from public view after May 19 , 1989 , when he visited students occupying Tiananmen Square and , with tears in his eyes , beseeched their leaders to end the protests .
The next day hardliners clamped martial law on the Chinese capital.On June 3 and 4 , 1989 troops backed by tanks and firing automatic weapons stormed into the city , retaking the square and crushing the demonstrations with heavy loss of life.The open letter also demanded the authorities release fellow dissidents , including former student leader Wang Dan , who was sentenced to 11 years in prison last year for conspiring to subvert the government.The two other dissidents jailed by the Guiyang court were Liao Shuangyuan , 43 , a legal adviser , and Zeng Ning , 28 , a legal expert , who received four and two years in prison respectively for organising and joining a counter-revolutionary group.China jailed dozens of dissidents in 1996 as part of a drive for stability that followed an easing of foreign pressure over its human rights record , diplomats and human rights activists say.Beijing regularly hits out at criticism of its human rights record , regarding it as interference in its internal affairs and saying its priority is to fulfill the rights of its 1.2 billion people to food and clothing .
China 's propaganda machine on Thursday hailed the selection of Hong Kong 's first post-colonial chief executive as the beginning of true democracy in the territory.This is a day to be remembered in Hong Kong 's democratic development , the China Daily said of the choice of shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as chief executive-designate of post-colonial Hong Kong.It is ... the beginning of Hong Kong 's true democracy , the official newspaper said in a commentary.Tung was elected on Wednesday by a 400-member Selection Committee -- its members hand-picked by Beijing -- making him the territory 's leader-in-waiting.He will formally take up the job when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 , 1997 , ending more than 150 years of British rule.Major Chinese newspapers splashed across their front page news of Tung 's election and a picture of the bespectacled tycoon smiling and waving with his wife by his side.The newspapers carried a commentary by the official Xinhua news agency , which trumpeted Hong Kong-style democracy as totally new , that is different from the mainland as well as different from the West.We can see that Hong Kong is establishing a democratic way that is based on law , open , fair , civilised and proceeding in an orderly way and step by step , Xinhua said.China , angered at Western-style democratic reforms introduced by Hong Kong 's outgoing Governor Chris Patten , has vowed to dismantle the territory 's elected Legislative Council after the handover and install an appointed legislature.Xinhua took a swipe at Britain , saying : In the past 100 years , there has been no democracy in Hong Kong 's political life under Britain 's rule.All powers , including executive , legislative , judicial and military rights , were granted to the Hong Kong governors , who were appointed by Britain without consulting the local people , Xinhua said.It is China 's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong ... that offers Hong Kong the unprecedented opportunity for its democratic development , it said.Xinhua urged China 's rival , Taiwan , to return to the fold.Resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong ... is the first step of the Chinese nation 's great undertaking to realise reunification of the motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party , Xinhua said.It said Wednesday 's elections were vital to reunification with Taiwan under the one country , two systems formula , in which the island , like Hong Kong , would enjoy a great degree of autonomy and be allowed to maintain its capitalist system.Beijing and Taipei have been political rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 .
Taiwan 's Nationalist rulers say they are committed to reunification , but only under Western-style democracy.The political waters ahead could be choppy for the shipping tycoon.People will be watching what happens to Anson Chan , a Western diplomat in Beijing said.Tung has said he would like to keep Chan as chief secretary , but her past defence of Patten 's democratic reforms could make things awkward if she decides to stay on.She 'll have to preside over many policies that she has opposed , the diplomat said .
People want to see how she manages this .
Chinese police have detained veteran dissident Wang Donghai amid accusations by Amnesty International that those who dare to speak up face torture , imprisonment and even death at the hands of the government.Police in Hangzhou , capital of the eastern province of Zhejiang , told Wang 's family that Wang would be sent to a study class , a euphemism for coercive ideological reform , his sister , Wang Yisu , told Reuters on Saturday.Two public security officers took Wang away on Friday but would not say why Wang was being sent to a study class -- a holdover from the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution -- or say when he would be released , the sister said.Police would not let Wang 's family meet him or say where he was being held , the sister said.The sister said she suspected police detained her brother because he was trying to help fellow dissident Chen Longde , who jumped from a third-floor window on August 17 because he could no longer stand being beaten by a prison official.Chen suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital after the fall.I think it ( Wang 's detention ) had to do with Chen Longde ... My brother was angry , shocked and surprised when he heard about what happened to Chen Longde , the sister said in a telephone interview.My brother and Chen Longde were very close , she said.Hangzhou police could not be reached for immediate comment.Wang , 45 , and Chen , 39 , were ordered last month to serve one year and three years of re-education through labour , respectively , but Wang was released because of poor health.Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.Wang , a veteran of the 1979 Democracy Wall movement , was jailed for two years for organising street protests after armed forces crushed pro-democracy demonstrations by students at Beijing 's Tiananmen Square on June 4 , 1989 , with heavy loss of life.Western diplomats say Chinese authorities appear to be using administrative punishment more frequently to take dissidents out of circulation without having to go through a more complicated judicial process to impose criminal sentences.London-based human rights group Amnesty International criticised China 's human rights record .
The Chinese authorities do not tolerate any form of dissent , Amnesty said.They allow torture to continue , use the death penalty to try to cure social problems , brutally crack down on ethnic groups calling peacefully for more independence and detain hundreds of thousands of people every year without charging them with any crime , it added.When China 's rulers refuse to respect fundamental human rights , they set a precedent for repressive governments worldwide .
When they argue that local conditions and economic necessity mean human rights must take second place , their words are echoed by governments through the Asia-Pacific region.A commentary by the official Xinhua news agency earlier this year said that a plot by the West to force its human rights standards and values on other countries was doomed to failure.In April , China quashed a resolution drafted by the United States and the European Union to avert censure at the United Nations Human Rights Commission for the sixth year in a row .
Beijing 's new mayor on Monday vowed the battle against corruption in the Chinese capital would go on but sought to put behind him a graft scandal that led to the downfall of the city 's Communist Party boss.Acting Mayor Jia Qinglin told the Beijing People 's Congress , or city council , that a government crackdown on corruption had curbed wining and dining at public expense , the use of luxury cars by low-ranking officials and civil servants living in excessively large housing.The struggle against corruption has been crowned with new results , the mayor said .
We must unceasingly score new victories in the struggle against corruption.Chinese Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has identified corruption as a virus that could topple the ruling party and some of China 's most serious cases under communist rule have emerged in Beijing.Officials would be required to declare their incomes and gifts received and the government would speed up supervision of the approval of major infrastructure projects , the appointment of key officials and the appropriation of funds , Jia said.In his 100-minute speech to the opening session in Beijing 's Great Hall of the People , Jia made no mention of Chen Xitong , who was ousted as Beijing 's Communist Party secretary in April , 1995.The mayor wanted to bury the scandal , analysts said.Jia Qinglin is an outsider ... and does n't know how deep Beijing 's political waters are , one analyst said.Jia was party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian before being appointed as Beijing mayor last October.The Beijing People 's Congress was expected to formally elect Jia as mayor during its five-day session.If he can avoid the controversy , he will run away from it as far as possible , said the analyst , who asked not to be identified.Other Beijing officials , including former mayor Li Qiyan , have previously mentioned Chen in their speeches , urging party cadres to draw a lesson from the scandal .
Li has been removed and appointed a vice-minister of labour.One academic said : Jia Qinglin is a newcomer .
Issues like these are better left unsaid .
It 's no good if he talks too tough .
It 's also no good if it 's not tough enough.Chen , 66 , has been out of the public eye since stepping down as Beijing party boss after his protege , Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen , committed suicide after coming under investigation for corruption in April 1995.Chen was sacked from the party 's powerful Politburo in September 1995 , the most senior official to be ensnared in a corruption scandal since the puritan communists swept to power in 1949.Last December , Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa , said Chen could be punished for dereliction of duty but not for any more serious offence.Chen had accepted many expensive gifts , but more than a year of investigation into the man who presided over China 's capital for most of the 1980s had uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing in exchange , Zhang said.Chen was being held outside Beijing , pending completion of the investigation , he said.One of Chen 's sons , Chen Xiaotong , former general manager of a Sino-Japanese joint venture hotel in Beijing , has been detained .
His wife was free , but his mistress was on the run , Zhang said .
China 's propaganda machine had a field day on Thursday , lashing out at U.S. newspapers over accusations of torture and rape of Tibetan nuns and suggestions that the United States should get tough with China.The overseas edition of the People 's Daily , mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party , scoffed at accusations that Chinese authorities tortured , raped and murdered Tibetan nuns , monks and civilians in the restive Himalayan region.This series of articles in the Philadelphia Inquirer is weak to the extent that it is laughable , the newspaper said.The Inquirer published last December a series of articles documenting what it said were stories of rape , torture and murder of Tibetan monks , nuns and ordinary people at the hands of Chinese authorities.In the articles nearly two dozen cases were documented , including names and dates , from the Himalayan region that has been rocked in recent years by periodic anti-Chinese unrest led by monks and nuns seeking independence and the return of the exiled Dalai Lama.This is a critical story that lays bare the efforts by the ( Chinese ) government to wipe out the culture and religion of the Tibetan people through torture and worse , PRNewswire last December quoted Inquirer Editor Mawell E.P .
King as saying.International human rights groups have made similar accusations , quoting Tibetans who fled China.China denied the accusations.One of the main reasons for the Philadelphia Inquirer and some U.S. media to repeatedly fabricate lies about Tibet is their strong bias , arrogance and conceitedness , the People 's Daily said.Using the so-called Tibet problem to incite anti-Chinese sentiment is fashionable among the U.S. media , it said.China 's propaganda machine also took on the New York Times , despite a recent rapid warming in ties between Beijing and Washington that had deteriorated in 1995 and up to mid-1996.The venom of the New York Times editorial lies in the fact that it ... seditiously creates an atmosphere that will poison the relationship between China and the United States at a time when there is a tendency toward improving the bilateral relations , the Xinhua news agency said.The Times ' editorial writer has one special skill : the ability to confuse black and white and to call a deer a house , Xinhua said.The New York Times suggested in a January 30 editorial that U.S. President Bill Clinton should get tough with China.The demise of Communism may come someday in China , but it would be a mistake to adopt a passive American policy based on that optimistic prospect , as Mr. Clinton seems to be doing , the Times said.There is already abundant evidence suggesting that Communism in China is not dying but is instead mutating into a new form that tolerates economic liberties while still suffocating political freedom , the Times said.Xinhua said comparing in the same breath the collapse of the Berlin Wall with socialist China , which is prospering , was an incongruous comparison just as donkeys ' lips do n't match horses ' jaws .
Guo Song stood impassive , his arms clamped to his side by two court policemen , as a Beijing judge sentenced him to death for bank robbery after a trial in which he was presumed guilty from the start.Guo , who killed four bank guards and stole several payrolls , could well be dead by Wednesday , January 1 , when sweeping amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law go into effect.Standing under the insignia of Chinese communist rule -- a red badge embossed with five stars -- the judge delivered the verdict on Guo during proceedings videotaped by a court clerk.Court hearings in China resemble theatre .
Verdicts may be decided beforehand and trials are little more than farce , said one judge-turned-lawyer who asked not to be identified.I used to think defence lawyers were laughable , he said in an interview .
The verdict had already been decided .
It was purely acting like in a play .
Whatever defendants or defence lawyers said does not matter.Defendants in China have been presumed guilty before being proved innocent .
Suspects can be detained almost indefinitely , and lawyers have access to the bill of indictment only days before a trial.All this is set to change from January 1 , 1997.It 's a big improvement compared with the past , criminal law professor Qu Xinjiu said of the revisions approved by the National People 's Congress , or parliament , last March.However , some Chinese and foreign jurists wonder whether China 's fledgling modern legal system will be able to implement these reforms and doubt whether defendants will have real access to a fair trial because of the poor quality of many judges , prosecutors and police.BIG TEST NEXT YEARNext year will be a big test of whether the quality of judges , prosecutors and police can keep up with judicial reforms , lawyer Li Shuguang said in an interview.China 's judges and prosecutors are not prepared .
They will need training ...
They will have to change their mentality.The amendments aim to transform judges from instruments of prosecution to evaluators of evidence , jurists said.No one shall be convicted without a verdict pronounced by a people 's court according to the law , says Article 12 of the revised law that alters the presumption of guilt.Robin Munro of Human Rights Watch/Asia argued that the amendments do not embrace the presumption of innocence.It is not correct ... to say that this new law has enshrined the presumption of innocence , Munro told Reuters by telephone from Hong Kong.It ( merely ) rejects the presumption of guilt , Munro said.The amendments , however , would allow suspects to consult a lawyer after police interrogation and set a 14-1/2 month limit on the length of police detention before trial.After January 1 , 1997 , prosecutors would be required to produce in court evidence they have purportedly collected.DISSIDENTS UNLIKELY BENEFICIARIESCritics say the new laws would benefit common criminals rather than dissidents , many of whom were swiftly locked up in 1996 to avoid the complications of the new law.Where dissidents are concerned it 's the Communist Party leadership that decides what happens to them ...
The courts are just there to carry out the political decision , Munro said.Dissidents jailed in the last year included Wang Dan , a leader of the 1989 student-led demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military .
Wang was sentenced to 11 years in prison in November for conspiring to subvert the government.Critics say the concept of rule by law remains alien to China , where for centuries imperial officials wielded absolute power and their word alone was tantamount to law.Police have promised to abide by the new law , but officials concede many police and judicial officials lack basic legal expertise and operate virtually unchecked in their own fiefdoms.Torture is commonly used by police in the countryside to extract confessions from suspects and facilitate the collection of evidence , critics say.Evidence collected through torture can still be used in court against defendants , critics say .
Suspects have no right to remain silent in China.Critics are concerned about an entirely new section in the Criminal Procedure Law that calls for summary trials where an offence is punishable by a jail term of less than three years.It 's a big step backwards , Munro said .
All these beautiful new rules ... for presenting of evidence , cross examining of witnesses , conducting court debate ... these all go out the window.Corruption is rife and threatens actual implementation.Money can buy a life sentence instead of the court handing down a death sentence , the judge-turned-lawyer said .
China and South Korea negotiated on Friday over the defection of a top North Korean who has taken refuge in Seoul 's mission in Beijing while Pyongyang officials said they aimed to persuade the defector to return.Talks in Singapore between South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha and Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen failed to break a deadlock over the defector , Hwang Jang-yop , 73 , the most senior Pyongyang official to flee the North.In Beijing , however , a South Korean embassy official said negotiations had begun over Hwang , who spent a second night in the embassy compound with an aide as Seoul and Pyongyang both made hectic efforts to claim him.China has been dragged unwillingly into the row between an old communist comrade and a new business friend.Diplomats have said China may find itself with little option but to give in to the wishes of the defector , thus angering one of its last remaining socialist allies.Beijing tried to play for time.This incident happened all of a sudden , so we need more time to investigate , China 's Qian told reporters after a 50-minute meeting with Seoul 's Yoo in Singapore.He urged both Koreas to treat this matter with a cool and calm manner , to keep peace and stability.Yoo said the two sides would meet again , but did not say where or when .
He said Friday 's talks were good.In the sedate , tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing , dozens of Chinese police cordoned Seoul 's consular section off for a second day .
Hwang arrived at its door on Wednesday to seek asylum.They ( North Koreans ) are harassing us and we are a little nervous about that , said South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik , adding that Seoul had asked Beijing to maintain tight security around the compound.Hwang , who could face summary execution or a lifetime in the gulag if he goes back to the North , was in good health and sleeping well , Chang said .
He was spending the day reading.A North Korean official standing outside the police cordon said Pyongyang had no plans to storm the compound to recover a countryman Pyongyang says was kidnapped.We are waiting here for him to come out and then ask him to come back , said the official who declined to identify himself.A group of about 10 North Koreans , badges of the late North Korean leader Kim Il-sung pinned to their lapels , returned to wait in freezing temperatures outside the compound on Friday after police asked them to leave overnight.If China allows him to go to South Korea then we will be disappointed , said another North Korean .
It will be regrettable.Some commentators have suggested Pyongyang might react violently to the defection of a man ranked 24 in its hierarchy , who is a senior aide to reclusive leader Kim Jong-il and North Korea 's top communist party theoretician.Pyongyang has charged that Hwang must have been kidnapped , and has called on Beijing to sort out the mess.Seoul has dismissed as preposterous Pyongyang 's charges that Hwang , one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea 's ruling Workers ' Party , was abducted.It was not clear whether Kim Ha-jung , a special adviser to South Korea 's Foreign Minister , was meeting Chinese officials.Kim failed to hold talks with Chinese officials when he arrived on Thursday as Beijing , apparently angered by Seoul 's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China , avoided a meeting , South Korean sources said.Officials at the North Korean embassy refused to comment or confirm reports from Seoul that Pyongyang had sent a delegation to China to discuss Hwang 's defection .
China hit out at Britain on Thursday , saying London 's protests against Beijing 's proposed amendments to Hong Kong laws after this year 's handover of sovereignty were unacceptable , unreasonable and unwise.We can not accept the British protest , it is also totally unreasonable and the so-called protest is unwise , Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing.The British side is always forcing its will upon others and this will not work , Shen said , adding that Hong Kong was China 's internal affair after the handover and no other country had the right to interfere.Britain lodged a strong protest on Wednesday against Beijing 's plans to dilute laws guaranteeing civil liberties in Hong Kong when it regains control of the colony on July 1 after more than 150 years of British rule.The Foreign Office said junior minister Jeremy Hanley had expressed Britain 's serious concern over the proposals at a meeting with Chinese ambassador Jiang Enzhu.A spokesman said Hanley told the envoy that Hong Kong 's bill of rights and related legislation , which China wants to amend , were fully consistent with the Basic Law -- the post-handover constitution for Hong Kong promulgated by Beijing in 1990.China has accused Britain of violating the Basic Law by unilaterally introducing laws guaranteeing civil liberties in Hong Kong after the handover.Shen , the Chinese spokesman , defended China 's plan to amend or repeal a list of 25 laws and ordinances , saying China was merely reversing unilateral changes made by Britain.It is fair and reasonable , Shen said of the proposed amendments.Beijing is moving to replace Hong Kong 's elected Legislative Council with a provisional legislature and block a lenient law that would exclude China-style crackdowns on dissent.Shen charged that Patten 's expansion of the electoral process in Hong Kong in violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the handover was undemocratic.I think that violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration can not be considered as something democratic , Shen said .
We are upholding the solemnity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.A Chinese envoy to Hong Kong blamed the British protest on Patten , the 28th and last British governor of Hong Kong.This was an angry act by Chris Patten who was ashamed that his long-time confrontation with China had been unfruitful , Zhang Junsheng , deputy director of Xinhua News Agency , China 's de facto diplomatic mission in Hong Kong , told reporters in the colony.China 's opponents say its planned steps fly in the face of vows that allow Hong Kong to keep its freedoms after it becomes a Special Administrative Region of China.Patten has called Beijing 's moves a legal nonsense while pro-democracy groups said it was a blow to democracy and human rights that would dent overseas confidence in Hong Kong.Donald Tsang , who is responsible for drafting a budget for wealthy Hong Kong that straddles the transition , said China would need to convince investors the changes were necessary.If you ca n't convince the people of Hong Kong , people may take to the streets , some may keep their frustration in their hearts , some in the civil service may quit .
Some may emigrate , he told the South China Morning Post newspaper.The United States expressed strong concern on Tuesday and called on China to reconsider its moves .
Fresh from a high-court victory , Florida 's anti-tobacco activists are bracing for a legislative assault on the innovative law allowing the state government to sue cigarette makers.Although bloodied by past failures to repeal the 1994 law , which undoes many of tobacco industry 's best legal defenses , opponents said on Tuesday the campaign to repeal Florida 's third-party medical liability act would continue through the current legislative session scheduled to last until May .
The fight goes on , said Jodi Chase , general counsel for Associated Industries of Florida Inc , an employers trade group prominent in the repeal campaign.Bills to repeal the medical-liability law have been introduced in the upper and lower houses of the Florida legislature .
A repeal bill was vetoed by Gov .
Lawton Chiles two years ago and an effort to override his veto failed in 1996.The arena now will be the Florida legislature , said Harold Lewis , chief inspector general for Chiles .
Lewis said the governor and allies inside and outside state government expected tobacco companies and others pushing repeal to launch a full-press media and lobbying offensive , even though some top legislators have said a vote on repeal bills was unlikely this year.On Monday , the U.S. Supreme Court refused to take up a tobacco industry challenge to the constitutionality of the law but did not deal with the principal at issue in the industry 's challenge and left open the possibility of considering the matter after a trial .
Lawyers for both Florida and cigarette makers said the Supreme Court action makes it even more likely that a trial in the billion-dollar lawsuit against the tobacco industry will go forward as scheduled on August 4 in West Palm Beach , Florida.A spokesman for Philip Morris , one of the defendants in the West Palm Beach case , said the company rarely discusses its lobbying efforts but that the company 's lawyers were continuing to prepare for trial.Lewis said 60 or more lobbyists were working against the bill and that he expected millions of dollars to be spent by the repeal forces .
A group working with Chiles , the Coalition to Clear the Air for Florida Taxpayers , is preparing a media and organizing campaign to support the law , according to executive director Beth Labasky.The group , composed of health organizations and school groups , is calling its campaign , Tobacco : Florida 's Public Enemy Number One , and expects to spend under $ 1 million on advertising , consultant Ron Sachs said.Smith Barney tobacco-industry analyst Martin Feldman said a constitutional challenge to the Florida law was highly likely to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court if cigarette makers lose in the West Palm Beach trial.The Supreme Court has specifically provided the option of considering the industry 's claim at a date in the future , and quite possibly as part of an appeal -- should that prove necessary , Feldman said in a written report. -- Miami newsroom , 305-374-5013 Ordinarily seated at the rear of a courtroom , behind deep ranks of dark-suited corporate lawyers fighting anti-cigarette lawsuits , is the mystified legal defender of Dosal Tobacco Co.What am I doing here ?
Jose Martinez often asks as he fidgets through yet another courtroom hearing in one of the high-profile tobacco cases heading for trial.Martinez , of the Miami law firm Martinez , Gutierrez & amp ; DeCordoba , puts that question to judges and to plaintiff attorneys pressing lawsuits on behalf of sick smokers , non-smokers claiming injuries from other people 's cigarette fumes and the State of Florida , which is seeking tobacco money for Medicaid costs.We 're just a small manufacturer , a family operation .
We should n't be here , Martinez insists to anyone who will listen.Dosal -- now swept up in one of the great legal battles of the century -- is a tiny family-owned company based in Opa-Locka , a poor city north of Miami built by a real estate developer with a fanciful taste for Moorish architecture.It makes but a few million cigarettes a year -- compared with Philip Morris Cos. Inc. , the largest cigarette maker in the world , which last year shipped nearly 231 billion cigarettes in the United States alone.Still , Dosal 's name appears in three anti-tobacco lawsuits in Florida and another in Michigan , along with deep-pocketed giants such as RJR Nabisco Holdings and Philip Morris , which last year had more than $ 35 billion in tobacco sales.Dosal 's main customer is the Florida prison system , which sells Dosal 's DTC brand cigarettes in regular and king-sized lengths to the smokers among the state 's 50,000 inmates.Even so , Dosal is named in the state 's lawsuit against tobacco companies.Dosal also makes a brand or two favored by elderly Cuban emigres in south Florida , including Competidora.They buy bulk tobacco and make cigarettes on machines in Opa-Locka .
It 's a very small operation , Martinez said .
And the customers for the Cuban brands are old and dying.Good-humored and joking much of the time , Martinez is deadly serious about eliminating the legal threat to Dosal.In addition to filing formal requests that Dosal be dropped , he presses plaintiff lawyers informally with arguments on the futility of suing a company with limited financial resources.I ask every day , Martinez says.If kept in the lawsuits , including the so-called Broin class-action suit scheduled to go to trial Monday in Miami , Dosal could be made to pay a share of any monetrary judgment .
The lawyers pressing the Broin case intend to ask for $ 5 billion or more in damages.And while the tobacco industry has yet to pay out a dollar in court damages after four decades of litigation , leaks in the industry 's defenses are widely seen on Wall Street and elsewhere.The Broin case , being brought on behalf of an estimated 60,000 ailing and non-smoking flight attendants by lawyers Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt , is the first of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits coming to trial this year against U.S. cigarette makers.It 's their fault , Martinez said , pointing to the Rosenblatts during a courtroom interview this week after a hearing in the Broin case , filed more than six years ago.All the other suits copied theirs.Martinez said the Rosenblatts , who have named 10 defendants in the Broin lawsuit , were also responsible for the Michigan anti-tobacco lawsuit which has targeted Dosal and other cigarette makers.I do n't think we have even sold any cigarettes in Michigan , Martinez said .
( A former U.S. surgeon general will testify in a class-action trial that cigarette makers blunted efforts in the 1970s to warn Americans about the dangers of second-hand smoke , a plaintiffs ' lawyer said on Monday.Dr .
Jesse Steinfeld and another unidentified surgeon general , the highest medical post in the federal government , will testify on behalf of an estimated 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants claiming damages for illnesses allegedly caused by second-hand smoke on passenger jets , attorney Stanley Rosenblatt said.A jury trial in Dade County Court is scheduled to begin June 2 and will be the first class-action suit to come to trial in the United States against the tobacco industry .
It is but one case in a wide courtroom assault on cigarette makers.In a class-action suit , used in the past against asbestos makers on behalf of victims of lung diseases , a small group seeks damages on behalf of a larger number of people with similar injuries.A second class-action suit on behalf of all Florida smokers is scheduled for trial in Miami in September.He will testify that the tobacco industry did everything it could to impede the information from getting to the public , from getting to the scientific community , Rosenblatt said , referring to Steinfeld during a pre-trial hearing.Steinfeld is also scheduled to testify for Mississippi , whose attorney general is suing tobacco companies to recoup the cost of treating sick smokers through its Medicaid programme .
Twenty-one other states , including Florida , have filed similar suits.Rosenblatt accuses Philip Morris Cos. and other leading cigarette makers of purposely misleading Americans and conspiring with one another to hide the medical risks of second-hand smoke to sustain corporate profits.Rosenblatt gave no details of the promised testimony .
His statement came during a dispute over the exchange of witness lists.There 's simply no credible evidence that second-hand smoke causes disease , Michael York , a lawyer representing Philip Morris , said later .
We 're still very confident that our case is solid and that we will prevail.Susan Rosenblatt , the second member of the husband-and-wife legal team bringing the class-action suit , said the plaintiffs will also call a former tobacco company employee .
The witness has said under pre-trial questioning that he was instructed to destroy scientific findings pointing to the health risks of second-hand smoke , she said.The plaintiffs , who include Norma Brion , a non-smoking flight attendant for 13 years who was diagnosed with lung cancer , also will call an Australian cardiologist who will tesify that his research linking second-hand smoke and heart diseases was blocked by tobacco companies , the Rosenblatts said.Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye said at the hearing that he may name an outside lawyer to review some 1,500 industry documents the Rosenblatts want for the trial .
The tobacco lawyers oppose the use of the documents , the great bulk of which are not public.Kaye also extended until March 24 a deadline for the Rosenblatts to deliver a list of witnesses to tobacco-industry lawyers .
Hugh Whiting , a tobacco company lawyer , said the delay was harming his industry 's defence.Defendants in the case include the Brown & amp ; Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries , RJR Nabisco and the Lorillard unit of Loews Corp .
The prize in their hands , the question now is whether Ted Turner and Gerald Levin will feud or combine to exploit the golden opportunities being offered by the merger of Time Warner Inc. and Turner Broadcasting System.The companies , whose merger will create the world 's largest media group , won approval on Thursday for their year-old deal from the Federal Trade Commission .
The Federal Communications Commission is expected to give its approval soon , and final approval by shareholders of both companies is scheduled for Oct. 10.While it is already known that Levin , the Time Warner chairman , and Turner , founder and head of Turner Broadcasting , will occupy the top spots at the new Time Warner , analysts wonder about their chemistry.The low-key Levin will be chairman and chief executive while the flambuoyant Turner , who created Cable News Network and other major media properties , will be vice-chairman.The management side remains unclear , the division of duties remains unclear , said Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick.They have very different management styles , said analyst Dennis McAlpine of Josephthal Lyon & amp ; Ross .
A lot depends on which Ted you get -- Ted the imaginative , creative and dynamic or Ted the meddler , he said.Both Turner and Levin have pledged to cooperate , but only time will tell if the two strong-willed managers will be able to co-exist at top of the huge company.In addition , the roles of second-tier executives at Turner Broadcasting have not been announced .
Speculation about departures picked up when severance packages worth $ 29 million for eight Turner officials became public.Analysts said , however , the business fundamentals of the combination were strong.Together the companies will control top-tier programming and distribution systems for filmed entertainment and will have real strength with cable operators and advertisers both in the United States and elsewhere.Aside from being the nation 's No .
2 cable-TV operator , Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. movie studios and Time , People , Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines.In addition to CNN , Turner Broadcasting also owns film and TV studios , a cartoon cable-TV channel and the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks sports teams.Turner has been assigned oversight of the combined company 's cable-television programming , services such as The Cartoon Network and TNT.But whether or not Time Warner 's own cable-programming service , Home Box Office , will be placed under Turner is still not known , McAlpine said.He also said it was unknown whether the film and TV production studios now owned by Turner Broadcasting -- Castle Rock and New Line Cinema -- would be report to Turner or be assigned to the executives running the highly successful Warner Brothers studio operations.There is also the possibility the two Turner studios could be sold .
Krutick said she expected decisions on selling the Turner studios , including Castle Rock , which is being shopped around , to be taken up very quickly after the merger closes.If they can unwind an asset , one that 's duplicative , and pay down debt , I think they will , said Krutick .
There will be more smoke than fire when Philip Morris Cos Inc holds its annual meeting with shareholders on Thursday.Meeting in Richmond , Va. amid rumors tobacco companies are pondering a $ 300 billion landmark settlement , analysts say it is unlikely Philip Morris will tip its hand.No comment .
No comment .
No comment .
I 've heard it a hundred times , said Roy Burry , a tobacco-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & amp ; Co .
The industry is shut down on this .
Philip Morris holds 50 percent of the U.S. cigarette market and is a lead negotiator in secret talks with anti-tobacco forces aimed at resolving massive legal claims against the industry.Geoffrey Bible , chief executive of Philip Morris , and the head of RJR Nabisco , the number two U.S. tobacco group , have participated in the secret talks , sources familiar with the bargaining have said .
The latest round of talks , in Chicago , ended on Monday .
U.S. regulation of cigarette makers and other non-monetary issues have so far dominated the talks , according to sources .
But the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday that rivals of Philip Morris are pushing for lock-step cigarette price increases by all companies to pay for a proposed fund for sick smokers.RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp , according to the paper , quoting unnamed sources , is particularly worried that the financially thriving Philip Morris might forgo price increases in order to grab market share from smaller rivals such as number two RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. Analysts discounted the likelihood of such a pact , saying mutual pricing would violate U.S. antitrust laws and would go against the widespread retail practice of selling all cigarettes within a category at the same price.There are a thousand different ways other than pricing to get customers to buy your cigarettes , said analyst Emanuel Goldman of Paine Webber.A spokesman for Philip Morris declined to comment on the talks .
At the Philip Morris annual meeting , scheduled to begin at 0900 EDT ( 1300 GMT ) , activist shareholders are expected to present proposals urging the company to eliminate the suspected carcinogen benzo ( a ) pyrene from its cigarettes and that outside directors doing substantial business with Philip Morris stay out of meetings setting executives salaries.A third shareholder proposal , sponsored by The Sisters of Charity of New York , urges Philip Morris to adopt in developing countries the same limits on marketing cigarettes to young people it has adopted in the United States.The company 's board opposes all the proposals .
One activist group supporting the proposals , INFACT of Boston , will also have protestors outside the Philip Morris Manufacturing Center , INFACT executive director Kathryn Mulvey said.Two INFACT members will be costumed as Marlboro and Virginia Slims cigarettes handing out cash to a third , dressed as Uncle Sam , as the expected hundreds of shareholders arrive , Mulvey said.INFACT played a leading role during the 1970s and 1980s in the boycott of Nestle over alleged mismarketing of infant formula in poor countries and charges Philip Morris with unfair lobbying of government officials.INFACT also wants Philip Morris to change its marketing practices in developing countries , she said.Mulvey said the widely reported and historic talks between cigarette makers and anti-tobacco organizations had had no effect on INFACT 's plans to protest.There 's nothing that we 've heard ... that has anything to do with marketing to kids in developing countries or influence peddling , Mulvey said. -- Miami newsroom - 305-374-5013 .
A former U.S. surgeon general will testify in a class-action trial that cigarette makers blunted efforts in the 1970s to warn Americans on the dangers of second-hand smoke , a plaintiffs ' lawyer said Monday.Dr .
Jesse Steinfeld and another former surgeon general not yet named will testify on behalf of an estimated 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants claiming damages for illnesses allegedly caused by second-hand smoke on passenger jets , attorney Stanley Rosenblatt said .
Surgeon general is the highest medical post in the federal government .
A jury trial in Dade County Court is scheduled to begin on June 2 and will be the first class-action suit to come to trial in the United States against the tobacco industry .
It is but one case in a wide courtroom assault on cigarette makers.In a class-action suit , used in the past against asbestos makers on behalf of victims of lung diseases , a small group seeks damages on behalf of a much larger number of people with like injuries.A second class-action suit on behalf of all Florida smokers is scheduled for trial in Miami in September .
He will testify that the tobacco industry did everything it could to impede the information from getting to the public , from getting to the scientific community , Rosenblatt said , referring to Steinfeld during a pre-trial hearing.Steinfeld is also scheduled to testify for Mississippi , whose attorney general is suing tobacco companies to recoup the cost of treating sick smokers through its Medicaid program .
Twenty-one other states , including Florida , have filed similar suits .
Rosenblatt accuses Philip Morris Cos Inc and other leading cigarette makers of purposely misleading Americans and conspiring with one another on hiding the medical risks of second-hand smoke to sustain corporate profits.Rosenblatt gave no details of the promised testimony .
No opposing lawyer representing tobacco companies at the hearing commented on Rosenblatt 's statement , which came during a dispute over the exchange of witness lists.Other spokesmen for the tobacco industry were not immediately available .
Susan Rosenblatt , the second member of the husband-and-wife legal team bring the class-action suit , said the plaintiffs will also call a former tobacco company employee .
The witness has said under pre-trial questioning that he was instructed to destroy scientific findings pointing to the health risks of second-hand smoke , she said.The plaintiffs , who include Norma Brion , a non-smoking flight attendant for 13 years diagnosed with lung cancer , also will call an Australian cardiologist who will tesify that his research linking second-hand smoke and heart diseases was blocked by tobacco companies , the Rosenblatts said .
Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye said at the hearing he may name an outside lawyer to review some 1,500 industry documents the Rosenblatts want for the trial .
The tobacco lawyers oppose the use of the documents , the great bulk are not public.Kaye also extended until March 24 a deadline for the Rosenblatts to deliver a list of witnesses to tobacco-industry lawyers .
Hugh Whiting , a tobacco company lawyer , said the delay was harming his industry 's defense.Defendants in the case include the Brown & amp ; Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries Plc , RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp and the Lorillard unit of Loews Corp. ( ( -- Miami newsroom , 305-374-5013 ) ) Tobacco industry lawyers Wednesday accused the judge hearing a second-hand smoking suit of failing to reject potential jurors with anti-cigarette prejudices.Another five people , including a freelance television-news producer opposed by tobacco lawyers , passed initial questioning on Wednesday in the class-action case , bringing to 16 the people in the potential-jurors pool.Court officials said 80 or more potential jurors will be needed to find the six-member jury and the 12 alternates to decide whether U.S. cigarette makers are liable for lung cancer and other smoking-related ailments among 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants .
Jury selection is expected to continue for several weeks.Jury selection began on Monday , and Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye has intermittently asked follow-up questions to potential jurors after rival lawyers finish probing individuals ' attitudes toward tobacco use , big tobacco companies and their own smoking habits.Kaye , who accused tobacco lawyers late Tuesday of muddling the minds of prospective jurors , on Wednesday put questions to a Miami police department payroll clerk after she told Edward Moss , a lawyer for Brown & amp ; Williamson , the U.S. cigarette business of B.A.T Industries of Britain , she believed cigarettes should be banned .
She also said she was initially more sympathetic to the flight attendants than to the tobacco defendants such as Philip Morris.Kaye subsequently asked if she could put aside her sympathies and make a fair decision based on evidence presented during the trial and the woman said she could.Moss protested immediately after the woman left the courtroom.Moss said the judge 's questioning was unfair to the tobacco companies and asked that the woman be eliminated from consideration because she was biased against cigarette companies .
Her responses indicate the defendants have a different burden than the plaintiffs , Moss said.That is a matter for the court to decide , Kaye said , refusing to block the woman.A similar clash occured late Tuesday , when Kaye accused the tobacco lawyers of manipulative questioning of jurors and Moss said the judge should not question the jurors.Kaye also rejected a tobacco lawyer 's request that a freelance television-news producer be blocked .
The woman said she had sued a big corporation several years ago and had worked on stories about cigarettes for a Miami station but that she could weigh the evidence fairly.Other people questioned and allowed to pass into the prospective jurors pool included a Pan American jet dispatcher and an office worker with two young children.Jury questioning has been slow , with each side spending 20 minutes or more querying each person .
Next week , the court will question jurors only on Monday and Tuesday because of a break for a Jewish holiday .
Cigarette makers bargaining with anti-tobacco activists on settling smoking lawsuits have talked little about money and are dwelling on tighter government regulation of tobacco and eliminating sales pitches to youths , sources said Friday.Less than 5 percent of the time in those rooms was spent on money , said one participant in the talks , who spoke on condition of anonymity.The talks -- which began behind closed doors about two weeks ago between top industry executives and an array of anti-tobacco leaders -- are expected to resume Sunday in Chicago , a source familiar with the negotiations said.A second session is planned for Monday , with an early break for the Passover holiday .
The source said no other talks were planned for next week.One set of key players in the talks , the state attorneys general suing tobacco companies over Medicaid costs , was struggling to coordinate its approach , according to Ed Cafasso , spokesman for Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger.In the United States , Attorneys general are the top legal officials in the individual states.Washington politicians and some health groups have objected to some publicized proposals as tepid and a reported $ 300 billion settlement as too little.News on Wednesday of the talks , a landmark in the 40 years the tobacco industry has steadfastly fought lawsuits and restrictions on its products , still cheered Wall Street.Investors Friday again raised tobacco company stock prices on speculation that a comprehensive litigation and regulatory settlment , even with a price tag as high as $ 300 billion , was imminent.Stock in Philip Morris Cos. Inc. , the biggest U.S. tobacco company , rose $ 2.625 to $ 44.25 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading .
RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. whose R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is No .
2 , rose $ 1.25 , also on NYSE.The American Stock Exchange Tobacco Index rose 7.68 points , or 2.67 percent , to 295.47.Also helping tobacco stocks was the news that the federal judge overseeing a tobacco industry challenge to new , strict government curbs on cigarette marketing had postponed his decision for a second time.A decision from U.S. District Judge William Osteen in Greensboro , N.C. , is now expected no sooner than Wednesday.Attorney Steven Berman , who represents several state governments in the talks , said , I do n't have any feeling for the pace , but we 'll keep talking as long as we 're making progress.Published reports have said the industry might pay as much as $ 300 billion over 25 years into a compensation fund for smokers who fall sick with lung cancer and other diseases.In return , the tobacco industry would get broad shelter from lawsuits and higher stock market valuations on their thriving tobacco and non-smoking businesses .
Industry analysts generally approve of a settlement , although some say the industry is unlikely to pay as much as $ 300 billion.Several attorneys involved in the talks said the prime issues for the attorneys general were winning restrictions on selling cigarettes to people under 18 , unambiguous declarations by the cigarette companies on smoking 's health risks , and a pledge from the industry to develop safer cigarettes.The fourth is money , said John Hough , an assistant attorney general in Washington state .
The Florida judge in the Broin secondhand-smoke lawsuit on Thursday said he may undo the class-action status of the case , a move that would likely delay the start of a trial , scheduled for Monday.Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye said during a hearing that even if tobacco companies were found liable by a jury for injuries caused by secondhand smoke , the claims of an estimated 60,000 plaintiffs might be too cumbersome for a single trial .
Kaye said determining the direct linkage of secondhand smoke to individual ailments and setting the amounts due each of the non-smoking flight attendants covered by the Broin suit might be nearly impossible.I am very concerned about these issues , Kaye said.The judge , who is also weighing a tobacco-industry request that fraud and conspiracy allegations be dropped from the suit , gave no indication when he might rule .
Another pre-trial hearing was scheduled for Friday .
Kaye five years ago knocked down the class-action status of the Broin case , first filed in 1991 , but was overturned three years ago by a Florida appeals court , which ordered a trial after hearing tobacco company arguments the case was too cumbersome.In a class-action suit , a few plaintiffs claim damages on behalf of a broader group with similar injuries .
All share in damage payments , if there are any .
The Broin case , named after American Airlines flight attendant Norma Broin , alleges that cigarette smoke aboard U.S. passenger jets caused the lung cancer and other ailments of thousands of non-smoking flight attendants .
In-flight smoking in the United States was banned in 1988.In court on Thursday , tobacco company lawyers asked Kaye to end the class-action status of the Broin suit and said each of the claims needed to be tried individually , since many factors beyond cigarette smoke may have caused the flight attendants ' injuries .
This can not proceed as a class action without dissolving into 60,000 individual trials , said Hugh Whiting , an attorney for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co , a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.Susan Rosenblatt , an attorney pressing the Broin case , said people with like injuries could be grouped for determining damages if the tobacco companies should be found liable in the first stage of the trial .
Such sessions would be relatively simple , she said .
She also said a financial settlement might be worked out with the tobacco companies if a jury should rule against them .
They do n't like to talk about that but it 's a possibility , she said.Tobacco companies have yet to pay a single dollar in damages , despite four decades of U.S. lawsuits , but they are now in secret talks with government officials that might end some of the court actions against the industry .
Kaye asked Rosenblatt what would happen if he should end the class-action status of Broin .
She said she and her co-counsel and husband , Stanley Rosenblatt , were not now prepared for such a late change .
( ( -- Miami newsroom , 305-374-5013 ) ) Ordinarily seated at the rear of a courtroom , behind deep ranks of dark-suited corporate lawyers fighting anti-cigarette lawsuits , is the mystified legal defender of Dosal Tobacco Co.What am I doing here ?
Jose Martinez often asks as he fidgets through yet another courtroom hearing in one of the high-profile tobacco cases heading for trial.Martinez , of the Miami law firm Martinez , Gutierrez & amp ; DeCordoba , puts that question to judges and to plaintiff attorneys pressing lawsuits on behalf of sick smokers , non-smokers claiming injuries from other people 's cigarette fumes and the State of Florida , which is seeking tobacco money for Medicaid costs.We 're just a small manufacturer , a family operation .
We should n't be here , Martinez insists to anyone who will listen.Dosal -- now swept up in one of the great legal battles of the century -- is a tiny family-owned company based in Opa-Locka , a poor city north of Miami built by a real estate developer with a fanciful taste for Moorish architecture.It makes but a few million cigarettes a year -- compared with Philip Morris Cos. Inc. , the largest cigarette maker in the world , which last year shipped nearly 231 billion cigarettes in the United States alone.Still , Dosal 's name appears in three anti-tobacco lawsuits in Florida and another in Michigan , along with deep-pocketed giants such as RJR Nabisco Holdings and Philip Morris , which last year had more than $ 35 billion in tobacco sales.Dosal 's main customer is the Florida prison system , which sells Dosal 's DTC brand cigarettes in regular and king-sized lengths to the smokers among the state 's 50,000 inmates.Even so , Dosal is named in the state 's lawsuit against tobacco companies.Dosal also makes a brand or two favoured by elderly Cuban emigres in south Florida , including Competidora.They buy bulk tobacco and make cigarettes on machines in Opa-Locka .
It 's a very small operation , Martinez said .
And the customers for the Cuban brands are old and dying.Good-humoured and joking much of the time , Martinez is deadly serious about eliminating the legal threat to Dosal.In addition to filing formal requests that Dosal be dropped , he presses plaintiff lawyers informally with arguments on the futility of suing a company with limited financial resources.I ask every day , Martinez says.If kept in the lawsuits , including the so-called Broin class-action suit scheduled to go to trial Monday in Miami , Dosal could be made to pay a share of any monetrary judgment .
The lawyers pressing the Broin case intend to ask for $ 5 billion or more in damages.And while the tobacco industry has yet to pay out a dollar in court damages after four decades of litigation , leaks in the industry 's defences are widely seen on Wall Street and elsewhere.The Broin case , being brought on behalf of an estimated 60,000 ailing and non-smoking flight attendants by lawyers Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt , is the first of several multibillion-dollar lawsuits coming to trial this year against U.S. cigarette makers.It 's their fault , Martinez said , pointing to the Rosenblatts during a courtroom interview this week after a hearing in the Broin case , filed more than six years ago.All the other suits copied theirs.Martinez said the Rosenblatts , who have named 10 defendants in the Broin lawsuit , were also responsible for the Michigan anti-tobacco lawsuit which has targeted Dosal and other cigarette makers.I do n't think we have even sold any cigarettes in Michigan , Martinez said .
The decision by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd to buy three more Airbus Industrie A340 long range aircraft will increase the airline 's air cargo opportunities , according to a senior Cathay cargo executive.Ray Jewell , cargo marketing and sales manager for Cathay Pacific Cargo , told Reuters in an interview that the new aircraft will be able to fly between 15 and 17 tonnes of belly space cargo plus passengers in normal weather conditions from Hong Kong to Toronto.Other possible destinations for the new aircraft from Hong Kong to Europe are still being studied , he added .
The A340 's ability to fly ultra-long distances will mean some existing routes become non stop destinations , Jewell said.These new aircraft will certainly help us on the air cargo side of things , there is no question about that .
We are very pleased with our existing A340s which are very cargo friendly and fuel-efficient along with our Boeing 777s , Jewell said.Cathay currently have four A340-200 and three A340-300 in its fleet.The new Airbus A340-300 models are due to be delivered in the second and third quarters of 1998 to coincide with the opening of Hong Kong 's new airport at Chek Lap Kok and increased flight schedules.Chek Lap Kok will definitely open things up for us and for other airlines which at the moment are restricted for slots at Kai Tak .
The new airport is a major factor in planning and strategy .
The increased cargo opportunities go hand in hand , Jewell added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017 Some airlines and freight forwarders say they anticipate a traditional mini-boom in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holiday starting on February 6 , and despite space being available , rates are firmer than might be expected , a Reuters survey shows.But industry sources also generally expect trans-Pacific rates to stay flat for the next couple of months.Following what was reported to be one of the busiest pre-Christmas peak periods seen in Hong Kong for many years , the start of 1997 has seen the trans-Pacific air cargo market slump back into familiar January doldrums.But both airlines and freight forwarders say they are pleased to report that last year 's disastrous January , which many said was the worst they had ever experienced , has not been repeated.Industry spokesmen said many factories in China which airfreight their finished goods out of Hong Kong are awaiting a new round of export licences .
As soon as they are granted in the next few days , both airlines and freight forwarders expect a rush from manufacturers anxious to complete shipments before factory production comes to a virtual standtill for the two week long holiday or more.More than one freight forwarder complained that , despite the seasonal drop in demand , cargo rates have not dropped as much as had been expected.One well known freight forwarder in the territory said airlines are unusually keen to do deals on rates which indicated they have space to fill .
He was happy doing business for a 35 tonne shipment to Los Angeles earlier this week which cost around HK $ 15 per kilo.Airlines which never normally do deals are very keen this month which indicates there is spare capacity around , he said.The market is reasonably busy and there is quite a bit of freight around , he added.Yoichi Tanaka managing director of freight forwarding firm Kintetsu World Express ( HK ) Ltd said despite a softening of demand , ex-HK rates to Japan were being deliberately held firm by airlines who think they can still make money from the current market.The market has seen its normal slow down both to Japan and trans-Pac compared with the peak season .
Overall , for both air freight exports and imports , the market is better than last January , said Tanaka who is optimistically forecasting four to five cent growth over the next six months.Yang Seung Joo , general manager for Korean Airlines Cargo in Hong Kong , was one airline executive who said that he was keen to maintain rate levels.We are trying to keep our prices as high as they were at the end of the year ( during peak season ) .
This year we will keep prices for all destinations a little bit higher than last year to protect our interests , he said.KAL has three freighters a week - two Boeing 747s and one Airbus A300 - from Hong Kong to Seoul plus a joint venture flight with Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.Yang said demand was slack but business this year is better than last January which was the worst he had ever known .
He cautiously expects this year to be better than last.Strike action in South Korea had not caused any disruption to KAL 's cargo flights , Yang said.Another key player on Japanese and trans-Pacific routes , Cathay Pacific said the market had softened but was still healthy .
Compared with Cathay 's cargo services to Europe , the west-bound market was not as strong , Cathay Cargo 's marketing and sales manager Ray Jewell said.We are pretty optimistic about trans-Pacific which finished the year very strongly and the fact that the market has now weakened is nothing unusual .
What is unusual is the European market staying so bouyant .
Overall we are looking pretty good for the start of the year , he saidCathay said there will undoubtedly be a pre-Chinese New Year boom in business but any indication of how strong the market really is will not really be known until after the holidayDavid Sung , Hong Kong sales manager for Polar Air Cargo , which operates only trans-Pacific services from Hong Kong to Chicago , Colombus and New York , said the market had followed its traditional pattern and slumped after early January .
Flights have been cancelled because of lack of demand.But he said he was hopeful of a mini-peak season in the coming fortnight as factories in China rush to dispatch orders.The market is slowly picking up after being dead slow right after western new year .
Chinese New Year is coming soon this year in early February and we expect a rush next week when we will operate a full schedule of five flights a week and are ready to put on additional flights if needed because we have aircraft available , Sung said.He did not anticipate a rise in trans-Pacific rates in the lead-up to Chinese New Year.A spokesman for All Nippon Airlines Co Ltd and its subsidiary Nippon Cargo Airlines ( NCA ) was also anticipating a rush before Chinese New Year as mainly garment manufacturers in China are awarded export licences.I think the market will pick up next week as manufacturers hurry to get their orders out .
Last January was terrible but this year it is better and we expect a rush , the spokesman said.He also said the outlook on both trans-Pacific routes and those to Japan during spring was reasonably optimistic.But Northwest Cargo , which said it is the largest US trans-Pacific carrier , was not anticipating any major rise in demand leading up to Chinese new year.After the pre-Christmas dash to meet year-end quotas the market has died down but , thankfully , not as much as last year .
Northwest also cancelled flights in early January due to lack of demand.After the peak , rates have dropped but not substantially .
I would say they are normal for this time of year .
Concerning volumes , it 's a case of so far so good , the Northwest spokesman said.He also said there is currently a trade imbalance with exports far exceeding imports and demand for traffic to the U.S. East coast markedly higher than to the West coast.Thomas Miu , general manager of the air freight division of Jardine Freight Services , was also pessimistic about a pre-holiday 'mini-boom'.I doubt very much whether we will see a little bit of a rush before Chinese New Year which is just two weeks away .
I do n't see any sign yet .
I 'm hoping we will have a boom before Easter , Mui said.A leading freight forwarder who uses a variety of airlines said space on flights from Hong Kong to New York was wide open with rates generally around HK $ 20.50 .
For destinations to the US west coast , average shipment prices were reported to be around $ 19.50.Rates to Japan on so-called first-class carriers such as Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines Co Ltd are reported to be around $ 14 with around a $ 2 reduction at $ 12 for 'second tier ' carriers such as United Airlines with no restriction problems on space.Another trans-Pacific airline operating from Hong Kong , U.S.-based Evergreen International Airlines Inc , is operating a full schedule of four trans-Pacific freighter flights a week until Chinese New Year when , like many other carriers , all flights will be stopped as demand evaporates.The market is picking up after being a little bit slow which it usually is while people renew their export licences , reported Kersti Krepp .
Trans-pacific rates remain firm , she added.Japan Airlines is not yet in full swing after the early January lull but is another optimistic airline expecting another busy period before Chinese new year .
JAL offers four freighters per week to Tokyo 's Narita airport in addition to at least five daily passenger flights to Narita and Osaka offering around 15 tonnes belly capacity each with trans-pacific connections.Rates to Japan are holding steady , very stable .
Trans-pacfic rates are negotiatable with different deals being done .
Exports from Hong Kong are also exceeding imports , a JAL spokesman told Reuters.The importance of the Japanese and trans-Pacific markets to Hong Kong 's economy can be seen from the latest cargo statistics for November from the territory 's Civil Aviation Department.They show more than 21,000 tonnes of air freight exports to the U.S. while imports amount only to less than 5,500 tonnes .
New York 's JFK airport accounts for 4,400 tonnes of exports , Los Angeles 3,225 , Columbus Ohio 3.071 , Chicago 1,800 tonnes and San Francisco 985 tonnes.For Japan , the statistics show Tokyo 's Narita airport is the second most popular export destination from Hong Kong after Taipei .
9,016 tonnes was airlifted to Tokyo compared with 9,441 tonnes to Taipei during November .
But only 4,502 tonnes of cargo was airlifted from Tokyo to Hong Kong .

People all over the world have been working on a translator for a long time and some universities have developed a working model .
There is an awful lot of work to be done but it 's not too far off and the benefits will be out of this world when it comes , Leong added.Industry observers say there are tremendous difficulties in developing a Chinese to English translator because of the number and complexity of the characters and not every English word has a Chinese equivalent but agree the potential benefits are huge.Among CargoNet 's shareholders is sea container specialists Hong Kong International Terminals ( HIT ) which is part of the Hutchison Group and Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents ( HAFFA ) .
- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017 Hong Kong 's Airport Authority , which is being pressured by the world 's airlines not to impose much higher fees at the territory 's new airport , said it will reveal the estimated level of charges early in the new year.An Authority spokesman told Reuters that it was premature to speculate what the level of charges at Chek Lap Kok would be.The Authority is still looking at its future charges in consultation with the airlines and the government .
The estimated level of charges will be available early in the new year and will then go before the Civil Aviation Department and the Executive Council for approval , the spokesman said .
He said he could not give an exact date when the charges would be published.On Monday the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) said it was dismayed by rumours of drastically increases up to four times the current charges at Kai Tak airport.An IATA official estimated last month that this would mean a Boeing 747 would have to pay US $ 12,000 every time it landed at Chep Lap Kok .
This compares to the existing most expensive landing fee of US $ 9,000 at Osaka 's Kansai airport.IATA also said revenues raised from the proposed redevelopment of Kai Tak should be used to offset the cost of using Chek Lap Kok .
Hong Kong 's new US $ 10 billion airport and associated infrastructure projects is due to open in April 1998.A spokeswoman for Hong Kong 's Civil Aviation Department said it was too soon to comment on future landing fees.Regarding using money raised from the redevelopment of Kai Tak to offset charges at the new airport , she said a decision on the old airport 's future use would not be made until after the Chinese handover next summer.Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44-171-542-7706 Fax+44-171-542-5017 KLM Cargo intends to increase air cargo rates in northern Asia by between five and 10 per cent in the first quarter of the new year , KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV regional director sales , Tom Presnail told Reuters.Exactly by how much has not been decided yet but it is definitely our objective to raise our income if at all possible sometime during the first quarter .
A decision will be made by the end of January and rates raised sometime after that , he said in an interview from his Tokyo office.My personal preference would be for a blanket rise ( on all routes ) but it might vary in some markets , he added.Presnail said he is responsible for KLM Cargo flights to the Japanese capital and Osaka as well as Hong Kong , Taipei , Seoul and Beijing.The KLM executive said the main reason for a planned rate rise in his area continues to be dramatic increases in fuel costs coupled with continuing general cost increases while yields continue to give cause for concern.Yields have come back fairly strongly in the last quarter but they are still , if anything , where they were a year and a half ago .
Fuel is one thing but other costs have escalated too and there is definitely the need for more upward movement in prices , he added.Presnail added that current demand for cargo space aboard KLM 's Asian freighters is strong.Most of Asia has been enjoying a very good , strong peak season with a lot of depth which is hanging on , hopefully into the new year too .
It is refreshing .
All indications are that it is the best peak season for a number of years , Presnail added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017 TNT Express Worldwide is to double the number of staff it employs in China and open five new branches within the next year , general manager for Hong Kong Bryan Chan told Reuters.The express freight firm said it has also applied for full landing rights at Shanghai and Xiamen to extend its dedicated Asian Air Express freighter service .
TNT uses two British Aerospace 146 and a Boeing 727 freighter in an overnight delivery service between Manila , Hong Kong , Singapore , Jakarta , Taipei and Seoul .
Industry observers point out that it took TNT five years to gain rights for the six existing destinations , so permission for the Chinese destinations is expected to be a slow process.We realise it may take time but Shanghai is a very good point to connect to the Philippines and gives us more options to eventually allow us to close the loop in our Asian network , Chan said in an interview.He said a main task for Eric Wong , newly appointed general sales manager for Hong Kong , will be to promote expansion of the air network.TNT currently has nine China branches in Beijing , Shanghai , Tianjin , Dalian , Shenzhen , Qingdao , Nnnjing , Hangzhou , Guangzhou in a joint venture with the state monopoly Sinotrans Group .
TNT plans to open new offices in Xiamen , Shenyang , Xian , Wuhan and Ningbo employing 300 more staff some of whom are due to arrive in Hong Kong this month to begin training , Chan said .
TNT currently employs 273 staff in Hong and 300 employees in its China branches , he added.TNT will also be focusing its expansion programme on southern China and the Pearl river delta.There is a big need for logistics and value added services in southern China including warehousing , documentation and pick and pack .
With the increase in volume we need more staff and more infrastructure .
We will try to offer the same 'one stop shop ' service as we offer in Hong Kong , he added.TNT said it expects its profits in Hong Kong to increase by 43 per cent this year after a 30 per cent increase in revenue along with a 20 per cent increase in China revenue .

They are ready and waiting for the go ahead on any routes that are available , Cathay 's international operations manager , Paul Horsting told journalists.The revolutionary air traffic control system allows aircraft to use Global Positioning System ( GPS ) satellite navigation instead of radar ground stations for more direct routings and more efficient use of airspace .
Airlines expect major benefits such as shorter flight times , reduced fuel costs and greater payloads.Explaining how Cathay is exploiting the FANS technology potential , he said 18 of the carrier 's 21 Boeing 747-400s , including two freighters , have been fitted with Communications Navigation/Air Traffic Management ( CNS/ATM ) equipment.Cathay 's entire 747-400 fleet is expected to be fully fitted by March and investigations are underway to fit the airline 's Airbus A340-300 long range aircraft too .
All 747-400 cockpit crew have already undergone training , he said.Cathay has been one of the gang of four airlines - along with United Airlines , Air New Zealand and Qantas - which has pioneered the development of FANS technology and been conducting trials in the North Pacific.Hong Kong 's Civil Aviation Department has given engineering approval to the new system and operational approval is imminent , Cathay said .
The Hong Kong government has also invested in FANS ground equipment which allows air traffic control messages to relayed to pilots via datalink instead of by voice.Los Angeles to Hong Kong is expected to be the first FANS approved route later this year with others to European destinations expected around the same time or early next year.Horsting said it was difficult to detail how much Cathay has invested in the new technology either in total or cost per aircraft.The saving is not just on navigation and more direct routes for aircraft .
Passengers also get much better benefits by being able to use satellite phones and faxes .
There is a saving otherwise we would not be doing it but it is very hard to quantify , Horsting said .
- Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax 5017 The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) said on Tuesday it supports plans for a single air traffic control centre to cover all airports in the fast growing Pearl River delta region in southern China.IATA director general Pierre Jeanniot told the Hong Kong International Aerospace Forum that all three existing air traffic service providers in Hong Kong , China and Macau had indicated acceptance of the concept after a recent meeting in Guangzhou.Jeanniot told Reuters after his speech that all airlines would benefit from a unified air traffic control through lower costs , faster transit times for overflights and reduced pilot workload.However he could give no timescale for when the concept might be introduced , where an overall centre would be based or how much it would cost.Three air traffic control centres can be very inefficient and potentially dangerous .
It is at a busy cross roads and it is important that local capacity is coordinated .
There is agreement now that it would be better if control was integrated .
The concept has been agreed in principle that it needs to be done .
Discussions are ongoing , Jeanniot said.Air traffic is continuously increasing in the Pearl River delta region with large airports at Guangzhou and Shenzhen and new airports at Zhuhai and in the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau.Also within a few minutes flying time is one of the world 's busiest airports in Hong Kong at Kai Tak , which will be replaced in 1998 by Chek Lap Kok airport offering even more capacity , industry sources said -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017 .
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has opened a new cargo office in Auckland , New Zealand , according to the airline 's in-house newspaper.It said Cathay 's cargo operations in New Zealand are growing fast following expansion of services from two to five flights a week between Hong Kong and Auckland over the past two years.Auckland 's cargo sales supervisor , Louise McNeil is quoted as saying the increased capacity means Cathay can carry a wider range of goods as well as help develop the long-haul market beyond Hong Kong .
-- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017 Cathay Pacific Airways Limited is the first airline to test fly a new 'sharks skin ' aircraft coating which could reduce fuel costs and revolutionise air travel , a Cathay spokeswoman told Reuters.One of Cathay 's four Airbus A340-300 aircraft has been partly covered by transparent , plastic adhesive foils containing fine ridges or riblets which resemble the texture of sharks ' skin.The spokeswoman said scientists discovered that sharks swim faster because their skin is covered in fine ridges running lengthwise along their bodies which reduces drag.She said Airbus Industrie hope the streamlining principle can be transferred to aircraft , reducing the amount of fuel burned by up to one percent.Over an aircraft 's lifetime , the fuel bill saving could be huge at a time when rising fuel prices are a highly topical subject.Airbus said it has already been conducting trials for several years with the U.S. manufacturer 3M but Cathay is the first scheduled airline to apply the latest technology , higher durability film.Cathay passengers flying on long haul routes to Rome , Zurich , Toronto and Melbourne will not notice unless they look very closely at the fuselage and the differing destinations will offer a testing environment for the coating , the spokeswoman added.It is a very interesting development for Cathay to be involved in and anything that helps to cut the cost of fuel will be extremely welcome to us and the whole industry , the spokeswoman said.She said the experiment is expected to last between one and five years with Airbus and 3M engineers visiting the aircraft for regular checks .
Cathay 's Flight Planning and Performance Department engineers will also be monitoring its performance , she said.We will have been an industry leader if this is a success , she added.- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017 Polaris Industries Inc. , best known for its snowmobiles , said Wednesday it will begin building motorcycles , riding its small-engine expertise into a market no major U.S. company other than Harley-Davidson Inc. has dared test in 40 years.Minneapolis-based Polaris said it is developing a highway cruiser motorcycle that will be named Victory and be available to consumers in the spring of 1998.We 've built pretty much all of it from scratch .
The engine was designed in the USA and it 's going to be made in the USA , said Matt Parks , who will be general manager of the new Polaris motorcycles unit.Polaris is the world 's largest maker of snowmobiles and is among the world 's top three makers of all-terrain vehicles , or ATVs , and personal watercraft.We 've competed successfully against Honda , Yamaha , Kawasaki and Suzuki in our other businesses .
...
Entering the motorcycle market is a logical extension of our diversification strategy , said Polaris Chief Executive Officer Hall Wendel.Besides the legendary Harley-Davidson , there are only two other , much smaller U.S. motorcycle makers -- Salt Lake City-based ATK America Inc. , a maker of specialised off-road machines , and Buell Motorcycle Co. , which is 49 percent owned by Milwaukee-based Harley and also located in Wisconsin.Polaris said its cruiser will compete with Harley 's machines , as well as similar heavy bikes from Honda and others .
The company declined to disclose price or design specifications.Polaris said it expects its existing customers will be among early buyers .
Customers who ride Polaris products are a loyal group who crave adventure , love the outdoors , and embrace the sense of freedom that our machines deliver .
Furthermore , some 30 percent are already active motorcyclists , Wendel said.The worldwide market for cruiser motorcycles is estimated at over 200,000 units annually , and sales of cruiser motorcycles have nearly doubled in the last five years , Polaris said.Engines for Polaris products are presently built in-house or by Japan 's Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. , which makes Subaru-brand cars , or by a Fuji-Polaris joint venture , Robin Manufacturing , in Hudson , Wis.Engines for the new motorcycles will be built at the Polaris engine plant in Osceola , Wis. , and the motorcycles will be manufactured at the company 's Spirit Lake , Iowa , plant , the company said.On Feb. 4 , Polaris reported 1996 sales of $ 1.19 billion , up 7 percent from $ 1.11 billion in 1995 .
Annual profits were $ 62.3 million , up 2 percent over the previous year .
Polaris said it expected 1997 sales to decline from the 1996 level but still show another year of record-setting profits.Expenses related to the development of the company 's motorcycles are reflected in its expectations for 1997 net income in excess of 1996 's record level , Polaris said .
The board of directors of WMX Technologies Inc. Wednesday rallied around its Chief Executive Phillip Rooney following a direct attack on his leadership by a major stockholder.An investment group led by financier George Soros called Tuesday for Rooney 's ouster and proposed a slate of nominees for the board of the largest U.S. garbage-hauling company.In response , the WMX board said it unanimously reaffirmed its support for Phillip B. Rooney and his leadership of the company during his seven months as chief executive officer.The exchange did little but aggravate the acrimonious struggle involving WMX , Soros and other large shareholders.I do n't think they could really escalate the animosity any higher than it already is , said James Kelleher , industry analyst at the Argus Research firm in New York.The New York-based Soros group and other investors , including the Lens Fund in Washington , D.C. , have been pressuring WMX to improve its performance for months.WMX , based in Oak Brook , Ill. , said last week that it was cutting 3,000 jobs and shedding $ 1.5 billion in assets in a broad effort to refocus on its core waste management business.On Tuesday , the Soros group expressed dissatisfaction with the restructuring plan , proposed removing Rooney and named four individuals to its alternate slate of board nominees.Even with a 5.2-percent stake in WMX , the Soros group can not dictate the company 's future , especially in the face of widespread small shareholder skepticism about the large shareholders ' motives.They can make a lot of noise and smoke , but when everything is done , their effectiveness is limited ...
This thing is far from over , Kelleher said.WMX last week reported a fourth-quarter loss of $ 461 million after charges , vs. a profit in the year-ago period of $ 49.6 million .
It reported revenues for all of 1996 of $ 9.18 billion , compared with $ 9.05 billion in 1995.WMX said Wednesday that the board nominees do not qualify for consideration at the company 's annual meeting this year.The documents we received from the Soros group attempting to nominate four individuals for election as directors of the company arrived after the filing deadline and contained incomplete information , WMX said in a statement.WMX added that its board was committed to search for the best possible candidates and its nominating committee had agreed to consider the Soros nominees later this year.Our board is absolutely committed to attracting the best directors possible .
We want to make sure we are serving the interests of all of our stockholders , WMX said.If Soros does not prevail before or during the WMX annual meeting scheduled for early May , time may be on his side.WMX is far from out of the woods and is likely going to have a few more painful quarters , which will strengthen Soros ' hand so that he might succeed next time , Kelleher said.The WMX board said that Rooney , a long-time manager of the company 's waste management business , was the right leader for the company as it concentrates on that industry.WMX also said an important component of its restructuring plan was adding new , independent perspectives to its board and reiterated it had hired an executive recruiting firm to find appropriate candidates.WMX 's stock , which fell 9 percent last week , was up 50 cents at $ 32.75 in heavy volume on the New York Stock Exchange .
Merger and acquisition activity is expected to pick up this year in the beleaguered U.S. nursing homes and sub-acute care facilities industry.After miserably under-performing the market over the past two years , stocks of nursing home companies have bifurcated into haves and have-nots , analysts said.A few top companies are at the point where they have worked through some problems .
Their stock values have absorbed market uncertainties about Medicare and Medicaid reform , and the next year or two look uncustomarily predictable , analysts said .
At the same time , the have-nots of the business continue to be dogged by company-specific difficulties that have held down their values , presenting possible bargains.There is a divergence in valuations and the industry is in the process of changing ... it is perhaps on the verge of an urge to merge , said Donaldson Lufkin & amp ; Jenrette healthcare industry analyst John Hindelong.Talk of more rapid consolidation was fueled Monday by Louisville , Ky.-based Vencor Inc 's agreement to acquire TheraTx Inc , of Alpharetta , Ga. , for $ 550 million in cash , convertible securities and debt assumption .
There seem to be a lot of companies or pieces of companies that are sort of being walked about ... There 's just a lot of activity , said National Securities healthcare industry analyst Michael LeConey.Sentiment is improving among the companies in the better half of the industry .
You may see some consolidation , said ABN AMRO Chicago Corp healthcare industry analyst Gregory Moerschel.The U.S. nursing home and sub-acute care industry -- comprising about 15,000 facilities nationwide -- enjoys a compelling demographic and structural profile , analysts said .
As baby-boomers age and managed care drives more medical procedures and patients out of high-cost acute-care hospitals , owners of facilities that can look after the aged and the chronically or mildly ill would seem to stand to benefit.Just looking at the numbers , this industry should be booming , but it is n't , said John Cumming , chief executive of WDI Capital Markets Inc , a healthcare investment banking firm.Growth by acquisition has been the rule in the highly fragmented industry and few firms have shown themselves able to manage it well .
The result often has been over-expansion , disarray and restructuring , analysts said .
After a bumpy two years , top-tier players -- such as Vencor and Manor Care Inc -- are in a position to snap up smaller firms , analysts said .
Also seen as likely acquirers are Genesis Health Ventures Inc and Integrated Health Services Inc in the home healthcare market.Identified by some analysts as possible targets were Burbank , Calif.-based Summit Care Corp and Retirement Care Associates Inc , of Atlanta.Retirement Care said Thursday it purchased 1.95 million more shares of Contour Medical Inc , a manufacturer of orthopedic and rehabilitative products .
The transaction boosted Retirement Care 's stake in Florida-based Contour to about 65.3 percent of total outstanding common stock .
Neither Retirement Care nor Summit could be reached for further comment.Sun Healthcare Group Inc was seen as likely doing a major deal soon , although some analysts said it would be a buyer and others said it would be a seller.Albuquerque , N.M.-based Sun announced Thursday it acquired nine nursing home and assisted living facilities from Clipper Affiliates in New Hampshire for $ 12 million plus assumption of leases at $ 6 million per year .
A spokeswoman for Sun declined to comment on speculation of the possibility of a larger transaction.Companies seen as pressured to make strategic moves of some sort were industry giant Beverly Enterprises Inc , Living Centers of America Inc , GranCare Inc and Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. ( ( -- Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787 ) ) Jones Medical Industries Inc chief executive Dennis Jones said Friday in an interview that he is comfortable with the First Call consensus earnings forecast of $ 0.23 per share for the fourth quarter.That $ 0.23 , I 'm comfortable with that , Jones told Reuters .
Which puts it at $ 0.79 for the year.St .
Louis-based Jones earned $ 0.16 per share , as restated for a three-million-share pooling acquisition of privately held Daniels Pharmaceuticals , in the fourth quarter a year ago and $ 0.50 per share in all of 1995 , Jones said .
Shares in Jones were down 1-1/4 to 31-3/4 on heavy trading , extending a bumpy week for the drug company.It 's huge volume , unbelievable , Jones said .
I guess they 're trying to find out what the valuation should be.Throughout last year , Jones ' stock price was extremely volatile , starting 1996 near 10 , climbing through the summer to 50 by September , then sliding in the past four months.Earlier , institutional holding of the stock had grown to over 50 percent from 15 percent of total outstanding shares , Jones said .
Of those , a lot of them were momentum players , and it looks like they 've lightened up , he said .
The company expects to report year-end financial results in the second week of February , Jones said.Jones has made four acquisitions since August , 1995 .
The company focuses on buying products from large pharmaceutical companies or others that have somehow not lived up to their sales potential , and breathing new life into them.I would like to keep that pace going .
We have the ability financially and I think we have the ability from a management perspective ... We 're sitting on $ 45 million in cash , essentially no debt and I think about $ 100 million of debt capacity , Jones said .
( ( -- Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787 ) ) Vencor Inc. has a definitive agreement to acquire Theratx Inc. , another health care service provider , for $ 354 million , or $ 17.10 per share , in cash , the companies said Monday.Vencor said it expected to begin a tender offer for all of Theratx 's roughly 20.7 million shares on Feb. 14.Theratx 's stock shot up $ 3.50 to $ 16.625 on Nasdaq .
Vencor was unchanged at $ 32.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.This will make Vencor the only company out there that can offer the long-term care hospital , the nursing home and the contract services , said D.A .
Davidson analyst Robert Thornburg.Vencor is the nation 's largest long-term care hospital company .
It also has sub-acute care units , nursing homes and speciality care centres for respiratory therapy .
Last spring , Vencor acquired Hillhaven Corp. for $ 1.9 billion.Vencor wants very much to be big and this makes them bigger , Hindelong said of the Theratx deal .
It 's probably not the last major acquisition that they 'll make.Analysts said Vencor expected the deal to boost earnings in the second half of 1997.Vencor said it expected to close the deal within 90 days.Vencor , based in Louisville , Ky. , said the acquisition would broaden its menu of contract services , which includes subacute , rehabilitation and respiratory therapy services to nursing and subacute centres.Vencor operates an integrated , long-term healthcare network with 38 long-term acute care hospitals , 279 nursing centres , 41 institutional pharmacies and , through its Atria Communities affiliate , 23 independent and assisted living communities.Theratx , which went public in 1994 , operates 29 nursing homes and sells rehabilitation services under contract to dozens of other nursing home companies.Like others in the field , its stock for months has been weighed down by uncertainty about the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration 's rewrite of Medicare reimbursement rules for such services.It was just a cloud hanging over their heads .
So there was a lot of incentive on the part of ( Theratx CEO ) John Bardis to go out and do something like this , said Arneson Kercheville analyst Jay Somaney .
Biogen Inc expects to begin European marketing of Avonex , a multiple sclerosis drug , within the next 30 days and expects European sales eventually to match U.S. sales , President and Chief Operating Officer James Tobin said Wednesday.At a Raymond James investors conference here , Tobin said , I would expect we 'll be on the European market within the next 30 days ...
Ultimately , I would expect that our sales in Europe would approach our level of sales in the U.S. Avonex sales in 1996 totalled $ 76.5 million .
Biogen 's total 1996 sales were $ 277 million , up from $ 151.7 million in 1995 .
Biogen launched U.S. sales of Avonex -- the biotechnology pioneer 's first major proprietary product -- in May 1996 .
Its sales have greatly boosted the company 's revenue stream , previously comprised chiefly of royalties for hepatitis B vaccines and alpha interferon patents licensed to large pharmaceutical companies .
Avonex reduces the frequency and severity of multiple sclerosis flares and competes with Schering AG 's Betaseron , as well as the recently approved Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.Biogen plans to expand revenues and earnings by selling more Avonex and getting it approved for uses other than multiple sclerosis , in addition to out-licensing other technologies , Tobin said.Biogen hopes to soon out-license Hirulog , a blood-thinning agent .
We have found someone who is interested , Tobin said.The company also has new possible products in the pipeline , including a renal disorder treatment called OP-1 , which is being developed jointly with Creative BioMolecules Inc , as well as other compounds.The point is that Biogen is not a one-drug story , Tobin said .
( ( -- Chicago Newsdesk 312 408-8787 ) ) Allegiance Corp chief financial officer Peter McKee said the company is comfortable with a Wall Street consensus 1997 earnings estimate of $ 1.55 per share , compared to 1996 operating earnings of $ 1.15 per share.The consensus estimate that 's out on the street at the present time is about $ 1.55 ... That would be consistent with the long-term goal , McKee said in a Reuters interview .
Gross profit margin for Allegiance was 20.4 pct for the fourth quarter .
There 's continued pressure on it .
We do n't know exactly where it 's going to fall , but we feel that it will be in that twenty range , McKee said.In the same interview , Allegiance chief executive Lester Knight said the company is seeing some price increases on the distribution side of its business .
But , he added , Some of the manufactured products have continued to have a lot of competitive pressure and we 've seen some prices decline.Sales for 1996 were about $ 4.38 billion .
Our sales for 1997 will be roughly flat , McKee said .
In 1998 and beyond , Allegiance expects to match or slightly exceed the market growth rate of two to three percent , McKee said .
Flat 1997 sales were expected as part of a plan to shift into more profitable businesses , Knight said.The company 's effective income tax rate was 35 percent in the fourth quarter , McKee said .
We had 35 percent in the fourth quarter and we would anticipate having a tax rate in that magnitude going forward , he said.The net debt-to-capital ratio was about 57 percent in the fourth quarter .
We still want to get it down into the mid-40s over time , McKee said , declining to give a deadline .
While still a small expense for Allegiance , research and development was $ 8.1 million in 1996 , up from $ 6.6 million in 1995.We anticipate increasing that by roughly 25 percent to close to $ 10 million in '97 .
Over the next few years , you will see us putting a little more emphasis on R & amp ; D , McKee said.Knight said Allegiance expects soon to announce another Best Value Product distribution program with the Kendall International Inc unit of Tyco International Ltd.You 're going to see a deal with Kendall announced very shortly , Knight said .
He said a price war in the hospital supply distribution industry involving Allegiance , spun off in September from Baxter International Inc , and competitors has wound down.The whole industry has come to the bottom of that price war and has started to expand those distribution margins ...
I would say that price war is over , Knight said.Allegiance is eyeing some possible acquisitions to expand its self-manufactured products business , he said.McKee said , We plan as we go forward in our free cash flow to use roughly half of it for paying down debt , and half of it for cash acquisitions ... . We 've committed that we have free cash flow averaging about $ 100 million per year for the next five years .
( ( -- Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787 ) ) A halt in shipments of generic blood glucose test strips distributed by Chronimed Inc could reduce the company 's fiscal third-quarter earnings by as much as $ 0.06 per share if they are not resumed during the quarter , said chief financial officer Norman Cocke.If we ship none of ( the strips ) in the quarter , we 're forecasting it could be up to $ 0.06 per share adverse impact , Cocke said in an interview with Reuters .
If the thing is resolved very soon , and it could be , then there is no impact.Shares in Chronimed were off 2-7/8 to 12-1/8 .
The consensus of analysts ' estimates for Chronimed earnings for the quarter ending in late March is $ 0.14 per share , he said .
The company earned $ 0.11 per share in the three-month period ended March 29 , 1996.Quik Check strips are manufactured by privately held Diagnostic Solutions Inc , of Irvine , Calif. , and designed for use with the popular OneTouch blood glucose monitor for diabetics manufactured by Johnson & amp ; Johnson.The strips are the only generic option to J & amp ; J 's branded OneTouch strips .
Minneapolis-based Chronimed is the exclusive distributor of Quick Check strips .
Shipments of the strips were voluntarily halted by Diagnostic and Chronimed in December after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raised questions about the consistency of the blood test results they render , Cocke said.Diagnostic Solutions is working with ( the FDA ) actively to reach resolution , but we have gotten no signal , if you will , as to when that would occur , Cocke said.Chronimed is uncertain as to what led the FDA to question and test the Quik Check strips , but added the agency routinely monitors the product quality in blood glucose test markets .
We are investigating this company , said an FDA spokeswoman , regarding Diagnostic Solutions .
She declined further comment.In fiscal 1996 , Chronimed realized slightly less than 10 percent of its revenues on Quik Check strip sales , Cocke said.In early 1995 , Quik Check strip production was put on hold for six months by Diagnostic as the company worked on improving its manufacturing efficiency and quality .
Output resumed in August 1995 .
Their volume of shipment and their general consistency of quality has been very good and quite to our satisfaction since then , Cocke said .
Volpe Welty industry analyst Ann Logue said the Quik Check business is very profitable when it is active .
But she questioned why Chronimed , which has several other growing lines of business , chooses to stay with it .
There 's evidence that this supplier is somewhat unreliable , she said.Chronimed is committed to the product , Cocke said .
We 've had our difficulties with it , but we think we can work through them , he said , adding that Chronimed 's independent testing of the strips shows they comply with industry standards.The generic Quik Check sells for about 20 percent less than J & amp ; J 's branded strip in the drugstore , Cocke said.Diabetics must check their blood glucose levels several times daily .
Most do so by pricking a finger and dabbing the drop of blood onto a paper strip that is then inserted into a machine that tests it for glucose level.Diagnostic Solutions could not be reached for comment .
( ( -- Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787 ) ) Under pressure from angry stockholders to restructure , WMX Technologies Inc. said Wednesday it agreed to sell for $ 626 million the 19 percent stake it holds in ServiceMaster L.P. , a provider of services ranging from lawn chemicals to household maids.However , critics of the nation 's largest garbage hauler stepped up their attacks , demanding more top-level resignations a day after Phillip Rooney quit as chief executive.Nell Minow , a principal at Lens Inc. , said WMX Chairman and Acting Chief Executive Dean Buntrock , 65 , should stay on the job long enough to find a new CEO , and then step down.Moreover , Minow said Lens would like to see WMX Chief Financial Officer John Stanford -- appointed only two weeks ago -- reassigned or otherwise removed from his post.Washington , D.C.-based Lens owns a small stake in WMX and is working closely with another investment group headed by financier George Soros .
The Soros group owns 5.2 percent of the company.Oak Brook , Ill.-based WMX is in the midst of a broad restructuring intended to appease dissatisfied stockholders and refocus its business .
On Feb. 4 , it unveiled plans to divest $ 1.5 billion in assets , cut 3,000 jobs and buy back 50 million shares of stock.WMX owns or has rights to acquire 29.035 million restricted shares of ServiceMaster , including an option to purchase 1.875 million shares that would be cancelled as part of the transaction announced Wednesday , the companies said.Although our investment in ServiceMaster has provided exceptional returns to our shareholders , WMX is returning to a highly focused waste management services company and we believe our investments should be limited to core business activities , Buntrock said.With this transaction , we are well along the way toward achieving our goal announced two weeks ago of monetizing an additional $ 1.5 billion of non-core assets , he said.The stock sale is expected to be completed on or before April 14 , the companies said.WMX 's stock fell 62.5 cents to $ 34.125 while ServiceMaster rose 25 cents to $ 25.625 , both on the New York Stock Exchange.The transaction is expected to be immediately additive to ServiceMaster earnings per share and will provide significant , incremental tax benefits to ServiceMaster , said ServiceMaster Chief Executive Carlos Cantu.It also eliminates market uncertainties regarding the status of the WMX shares , he said.Cantu said ServiceMaster intends initially to finance the stock repurchase with bank borrowings .
Duff & amp ; Phelps Credit Rating Co. said Wednesday it may downgrade ServiceMaster 's debt , pending further details of the transaction 's financing.Buntrock , 65 , founded WMX and was chief executive from 1968 until June 1996 .
At that time , he was replaced as chief executive by Rooney , who resigned Tuesday , just a week after his ouster was demanded by the Soros group.Earlier this month WMX named John Sanford as its new chief financial officer .
Formerly WMX treasurer , he replaced James Koenig , who became executive vice president.Minow said Lens is dissatisfied with Sanford .
The new one I would like to see reassigned , as well , or gone , Minow said .
They need to bring in an outsider.WMX spokesman William Plunkett , responding to Minow 's comments on the CFO , said , John Sanford has been in this job very briefly and he is an experienced financial executive .
He is well regarded among our investors and is actively engaged in the process of enhancing shareholder value.He declined further comment.Downers Grove , Ill.-based ServiceMaster 's network of service companies includes ServiceMaster Consumer Services and ServiceMaster Management Services , and ServiceMaster Diversified Health Services and International .
Its Consumer Services unit owns and franchises TruGreen-ChemLawn , Terminix , ServiceMaster Residential and Commercial Services , Merry Maids , American Home Shield , AmeriSpec and Furniture Medic .
United Wisconsin Services Inc expects its medical-loss ratio to decline to levels not seen in years as long as Washington does not spring another healthcare reform initiative on the HMO industry.In an interview with Reuters , United Wisconsin chief executive Thomas Hefty said the ratio -- the share of premium revenues spent covering HMO members ' healthcare costs -- could fall into the seventies .
The loss ratio is higher than we would like , but we 're seeing , particularly in our small-group PPO unit , an improvement over last year , Hefty said .
United Wisconsin finished its second quarter in June with its medical-loss ratio at 81.9 percent , down from 88.3 percent a year earlier .
Hefty said it could fall to the seventies.Premium revenues that are left over after covering member costs constitute the bulk of profits for a health maintenance organization , or HMO .
We think the industry overall is poised for a better 1997 and 1998 , Hefty said .
Probably the biggest uncertainty in the market is the reaction to the election.When the Clinton administration unveiled its healthcare reform proposal in 1994 , medical cost inflation plummeted and HMO profits soared .
When healthcare reform failed , medical cost inflation roared back and profits suffered industry-wide .
These trends have moderated recently , Hefty said , but he added that Hillary Clinton 's speech at the Democratic Convention caused concern.It said that if the Democrats have a big victory , we 'll see healthcare reform again with all of the interplay on the psychology of patients and physicians , he said.In the meantime , Hefty said he sees room for premium hikes to boost HMOs ' profits .
In our market in Wisconsin , we compete against Humana and United Healthcare and both of them have been taking strong pricing action , he said.We 're out there with price increases .
Underlying healthcare trends have been coming down again , Hefty said.Enrollment at United Wisconsin is growing , as well The Milwaukee HMO has a lost a little bit of enrollment with price increases , but we 're still overall up a couple percent due to enrollment gains in the company 's rural HMOs , he said.Our strategy is to keep looking for the rural markets ... We think those are good markets .
You get better margins and we 've shown the ability to not only get those margins , but get operating costs down , Hefty said .
London telecoms analysts are split about the prospects of Britain 's Cable and Wireless Communications , the telephone and television cable company that made its market debut on Monday.CWC started trading , as expected , at around 300 pence per share and rose to 309 pence before edging back to 299.5 , valuing the group at around 4.46 billion pounds.CWC , which was formed last year when the Mercury subsidiary of Cable and Wireless Plc merged with the three cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada , floated a 14.7 percent stake in London and New York.Brokers Lehman Brothers says a 4.5 billion pound implies an enterprise value of about 6.0 billion pounds , assuming pro forma net debt at the end of 1996 at 1.5 billion stg .
The valuation assumes a 700-800 million stg premium to the sum of the parts , assuming a valuation of Mercury of 2.0 billion pounds.The timing required to accomplish the technical integration of the various parts as well as the investments necessary to establish the new brand on a nation-wide basis suggest that at 4.5 billion stg , CWC assets are fairly valued.With 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure , CWC plans to complete its sophisticated broadband cable and local telephone networks and offer its services to six million customers by 2001.However , other analysts , such as Richard Jones at brokers Yamaichi and Andrew Harrington at Salomon Brothers , were more bullish.Jones is recommending buying the stock up to 350 pence per share .
Harrington values the shares at 438p and the company at 6.5 billion pounds.Harrington argues that CWC 's network cost structure has a competitive advantage against its main telephony and multi-channel television provider -- British Telecommunications Plc and satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc.It 's got 50 percent fewer employees per line than BT , he said .
We think CWC has a unique competitive advantage in the provision of multi-channel TV and telephony .
I think it 's going to exceed expectations in the next year.CWC 's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury .
Initially , 91 percent of revenues will come from telephony and only nine percent from entertainment , but it will be the first company to be able to bundle multi-channel television and telephony.Nevertheless , some analysts are cautious about the new company 's prospects .
Cable television companies have yet to make a profit in Britain 's stagnant market.On a longer-term view , any valuation becomes almost entirely dependent on your view of what the longer-term penetration rate is going to be for telephony and cable TV , noted one analyst , who declined to be named.He said BT would move into broadcasting by 2001 at the latest , when current regulatory restrictions are lifted , and the group was likely to move into interactive services such as home shopping and home banking sooner.Put that alongside the impact of BT 's on-going marketing muscle in basic telephony , combined with the impact of digital terrestrial TV and digital satellite TV , and I think that will all serve to put a brake on our expectations of long-term cable TV penetration , he said.Oliver Ehrenberg , telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming , says CWC is not worth more than 3.75 billion pounds -- and says his valuation is already stretched.But Harrington brushed aside these concerns , noting that BT 's network will need a lot of investment to upgrade its telephone lines so they can support multi-channel TV and interactive services.Everything BT can do Cable and Wireless Communications can to better and sooner , he said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 Mounting concerns about the loss of both two top executives and an equity stake in terrestrial digital TV sent shares in pay-television giant BSkyB diving further on Monday and analysts forecasts more weakness to come.Around 1.7 billion pounds ( $ 2.8 billion ) has been wiped off the value of British Sky Broadcasting since last week and some analysts said the shares , which fell 14.5p to 483p in afternoon trade , could tumble to 350p .
News Corp Ltd is the largest shareholder in BSkyB.There has quite clearly been a re-rating in the last week and I think it 's going to continue , said Jason Crisp , media analyst at brokers SocGen.Another broker said only in wildly optimistic cases could the shares be valued even at 450p.Negative weekend newspaper reports helped compound last week 's share falls sparked by a report in the Financial Times that BSkyB could be shut out of the bidding for new digital TV licences , experts said.The Financial Times reported last week the television watchdog , the Independent Television Commission , had told BSkyB it should drop its one-third stake in a consortium with commercial TV groups Carlton Communications and Granada Group.BSkyB was enjoying an effective monopoly on pay- television and the watchdog was concerned about market domination , the FT said.The report , which remains unconfirmed , followed last week 's announcement that BSkyB 's respected chief executive Sam Chisolm was stepping down and deputy managing director David Chance was becoming a consultant.SocGen 's Crisp said the stock , which had hit an intraday 1997 high of 669p on February 14 , had been vastly over-rated and should be trading nearer 400p.He noted apart from the possible loss of its equity stake in its digital terrestrial TV consortium , called British Digital Broadcasting , and the loss of two very talented and experienced staff , flat satellite dish sales and rising operating costs were hitting the shares.All these things make you think it should be on a more typical PE ( price earnings ratio ) multiple of other big media companies , he added.At 400p , the stock would have a more reasonable PE of 22 times next year , compared to one nearer 30 times before the share correction , Tysoe said.Credit Suisse First Boston was even more negative .
We 'd just re-iterate from our call last week that fundamental value on BSkyB is about 450p even in wildly optimistic cases , about 350-400p in more reasoned scenarios , it stated in a note.But Mike Woodcock , media analyst at Nikko , said the share price fall had been overdone and he would recommend buying the shares under five pounds.He said that in the short-term , the news on BDB , a business he valued at around 400 million pounds , was positive from a financial point of view.Compensation is tipped by the Financial Times at 75 million pounds .
BSkyB can also keep some 100 million pounds which it was going to invest in the joint venture.Is the news of BDB and Sam Chisolm stepping down enough to warrant 1.7 billion pounds being wiped from the value of BSkyB ?
I would say no , Woodcock said .
The real benefits for BSkyB are in the provision of programming rather than in the equity stake.But he said as traditionally high operating margins were squeezed -- partly because payments to show English Premier League soccer are set to rise to 160 million pounds per year from August -- he was expecting flat pre-tax profits of 309 million pounds in 1998 and 1997.Other longer-term concerns , he said , were about how independent BSkyB was from media tycoon Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd , its leading shareholder -- and how much News Corp would benefit from the success of the pay-television giant.The ITC hopes to decide by the end of this month on whether to award digital terrestrial television licences to BDB or a rival consortium run by cable and broadcast group NTL Inc. British broadcaster Carlton Communications Plc on Wednesday reported an 11 percent rise in half-year earnings helped by a strong growth in advertising revenue.Carlton , which operates ITV commercial television licences for London weekday TV , the English Midlands and the west of England , raised pre-tax profits to 158.6 million pounds ( $ 262.5 million ) from 143.3 million after a one-off loss of around 4.0 million pounds.Lifting half-year dividend by 12 percent to 4.9 pence and sending the company 's shares jumping , chairman Michael Green pledged that the group would continue to invest in businesses -- and boost prospects.We have maintained our clear focus , built up our market leading positions and enhanced both our profitability and our prospects for future growth , he said in the results statement.We will continue to build on this approach and make sure Carlton makes the best of its excellent prospects.The results helped restore some enthusiasm in Carlton 's shares , which have been underperforming the market by around 15 percent in the last three months .
By mid-morning , the stock leapt 18.5 pence to 517.5p.Carlton , whose library boasts over 7,500 hours of TV programmes including almost 1,000 films , said its core broadcast business was one of the main drivers behind profits , seeing a 19 percent rise on the operating level to 72.6 million pounds.An 11 percent rise in advertising revenues , higher programme sales and a 5.2 million pound trading contribution from newly acquired businesses such as Westcountry TV helped boost earnings.Robert Jolliffe , media analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett , is forecasting unchanged full-year pretax profits of 343 million pounds and said the performance of some of Carlton 's divisions -- such as its products arm -- had been extraordinarily strong at the half-way stage.Carlton airtime sales continue to dominate ITV .
They 've seen good market share gains and a strong London market -- so they 've done very well in the first half , he added.Carlton 's share of ITV 's advertising revenue edged up to 32.58 percent from 31.75 percent while telecoms , financial services and airline groups raised advertising spend in a battle to win new clients and keep old ones.But some brokers , such as BZW , are warning that the advertising revenue outlook over the next four to five years in Britain should be questioned against a background of increasing competition , analysts say.Another highlight in Carlton 's results was its fast-growing Quantel division , which designs and manufactures tapeless editing and broadcasting systems for the film and television industry worldwide.Operating profits leapt 28 percent to 26.2 million pounds , fulfilling expectations of rapid growth .
Some analysts expect new product launches to feed through into the bottom line in the next 12-18 months.But Carlton 's video division cast a pall over results , with operating profits slipping to 36.2 million pounds on 12 percent lower turnover of 242.4 million.Chairman Green blamed the slow start to the year on the timing of releases and variations in the mix of the business , but added that he was optimistic about making progress in the second half.Analysts are awaiting news on whether Carlton and its partners in British Digital Broadcasting ( BDB ) have been awarded key digital terrestrial TV licences in Britain.Carlton in January joined rival TV giant Granada Group Plc and Rupert Murdoch 's dominant pay-per-view broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc to form the formidable BDB.BDB wants to offer some 15 subscription channels .
The group faces competition from Digital Television Network ( DTN ) , owned by Nasdaq-listed NTL Inc -- but in what has been dubbed a classic case of David versus Goliath , most analysts tip BDB as the winner.Carlton , which has a cash pile of 166 million pounds , said it expected the Independent Television Commission watchdog to award the licence by the end of June.Digital terrestrial television brings enormous opportunities to Carlton , Green stated .
( $ = 0.604 British Pounds ) Tumbling trade barriers are triggering huge telecom alliances as companies struggle to straddle the world and offer lucrative services to multinational companies.But not even the biggest telecoms companies know where the revolution will end.AT & amp ; T Corp. Chairman Robert Allen was quoted last year as saying : One could reasonably expect the chairman of AT & amp ; T to know what his corporation will be 10 years from now .
He doesn't.One could , within reason , expect the chairman of AT & amp ; T to be able to predict how technology will transform his business a decade hence .
He can't.At least , he should know who his major competitors will be in 2005 .
Stumped again.But here is what he does know : something startling , intriguing and profound is afoot.Some telecom analysts warn that large-scale investment at a time of global expansion and competition will hit the margins and revenues of former cash-rich monopolies.Of the world 's major telecom companies , I would not be surprised if one of them , in the next five to 10 years , becomes perceived as a high risk company , said Andrew Harrington , telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers.As telecom companies jostle to fill the gaps in the global reach of their business , analysts are predicting an unprecedented surge of mergers and acquisitions in the $ 800 billion world telecom industry.World trade liberalisation is expected to lead to global mega-carriers that will try to capture the entire profit margin from the traffic of multinational firms with offices in the United States , Europe and the Far East.Harrington estimates that the top 5,000 multinational corporate customers account for 15-20 percent of global telecom revenue .
To be able to service them , carriers need asset bases in all the countries where they operate.While analysts agree that competition will become ferocious , some brush aside those who urge caution and argue that explosive growth will help maintain the margins of well-placed companies.Something like two-thirds of the world 's population live more than a day 's walk away from the nearest telephone , said John Tysoe , telecoms analyst at brokers SocGen .
There 's a whole world out there waiting to get in touch.In the last 12 months , potential mergers have run to tens of billions of dollars as carriers such as MFS WorldCom , British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp. , Bell Atlantic and SBC/Pacific Telesis announced plans to join forces.Because the cost of making calls is expected to reflect more closely the cost of delivering them , consumers will soon no longer pay the vastly inflated prices that have helped line the pockets of bloated national carriers.The advent of high bandwidth cable and modern switching systems also means that , according to some broker estimates , the cost of delivering a telephone call is about a thousand times cheaper than 40 years ago.A number of firms , facing margin-shrinking competition at home and aiming to service corporations , have formed three main global partnerships.BT and its American partner MCI have formed an alliance called Concert ; Deutsche Telekom , France Telecom and Sprint have linked up to form Global One.AT & amp ; T , the world 's second largest telecom company , has also set up loosely-knit partnerships called Unisource and World Partners.Telecommuncations used to be rather simple : Spend money to fix your network , cut capital expenditure and staffing levels and wait for the cash to start piling up.The more money is spent on a network , the greater the cash flows allowed by regulators to support its renewal , and the greater the potential free cash-flow improvement , when savings are eventually enjoyed.But a brave , new world is on the horizon , and the only telecoms stocks Harrington tips for investors are those which enjoy double-digit growth , are gaining share in their existing markets , and have assets in place to execute strategic plans -- or have a unique niche.Such firms could include Cable and Wireless , Britain 's second biggest telecom company , which analysts say combines an attractive home asset base with rare access to booming Asian markets.C & amp ; W has a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications , described as one of the best assets in Asia because it is not only majority held by non-government investors , but has potentially unique access to China and already faces competition at home.BT is also hoping that its planned takeover of MCI will make it more attractive as a potential partner to Asian companies such as Japan 's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. , the world 's largest telecom company .
U.S .
Midwestern local telephone company Ameritech Corp. said Friday it was in merger or acquisition talks with several European security monitoring firms worth $ 200 million to $ 500 million each.There are some serious negotiations going on , Ameritech 's international affairs director Dennis LaComb told Reuters.Chicago-based Ameritech hopes to double its current $ 4.0 billion in European investments over the next few years , said LaComb , who said he was in London until Saturday on a courtesy visit.The majority of our investment internationally is in Europe .
This is a very important area for us , he said.Over the past six years , the Midwestern Baby Bell has taken stakes in privatisations abroad in countries such as Hungary and New Zealand.LaComb said that security monitoring -- using telephone lines to link customers ' home alarm systems to police stations -- was a natural business direction for the $ 31.3 billion telecommuications company to take.Ameritech , which is facing its first taste of competition in its local market , is the second-biggest U.S. security monitoring company and hopes to become the European market leader.The first deals are likely to be struck in Germany and France , although the company said it was also looking at firms in Scandinavia and was considering Britain.Unlike some of its sister Baby Bells , Ameritech has no current designs on becoming a global telecommunications player.Instead , it wants to focus its international strategy on regional telecommunications , communications such as alarm systems and exporting its knowledge of customer services and of operating in competitive markets to telecommunications firms , such as Portugal Telecom SA , which are on the verge of privatisation.Ameritech 's foreign ventures so far include stakes in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand , a local , long distance and cellular phone and satellite television service provider , Poland 's Polska Telefonia Komorkowa and Norway 's NetCom GSM , two cellular telephone operators.It has partnered with Germany 's Deutsche Telekom AG to take a stake in Hungary 's incumbent Matav Rt telecommunications operator and also holds a stake in Belgacom , the Belgium national operator.International investments also include a joint venture in China 's regional cellular operator ChinaCom .
British cable operator Telewest Communications Plc disappointed the market on Wednesday by reporting widening annual losses and telephony and cable television margins that were below expectations.The group also told Reuters it might delay building out its national network because of heavy investments needed to provide multi-channel digital television and because of its plans to link up its seven franchise areas with its own fibre optic network.Annual losses before tax widened to 249.9 million pounds ( $ 397.3 million ) from 114.67 million pounds while turnover jumped to 290.27 million pounds from 144.78 million , excluding the effect of franchise aquisitions.Telewest will lose its position as Britain 's biggest cable operator after the expected completion in the next few weeks of a merger between Cable and Wireless Plc 's Mercury unit and three other cable operators.The company , which announced fourth quarter and final subscriber figures in January , saw its shares slip three pence to 117-1/2p in slim trade after the results.Alan Lyons , telecoms analyst at brokers ABN AMRO Hoare Govett said he was disappointed that the company 's telephony margins came in at 67 percent and at 42 percent for its cable television operations.He had been looking for margins of 70 percent and 45 percent respectively .
That really bodes badly for the business and that 's what I 'd take as the main bear point from the results , he said.Symptomatic of the growing competition faced by cable firms , Telewest 's finance director Charles Burdick said the group might seek to raise more funds for investment plans as fierce price wars keep a lid on margins.Telewest , which has about 900 million pounds of debt , has secured a 1.2 billion pound bank facility of which it has so far drawn about 100 million pounds.Burdick said Telwest was considering cherry picking or slowing down the building of its parts of its national network , which covers 65 percent of the country , in 1998 and 1999 to concentrate on offering digital television as the services comes fully on stream.Telewest , along with Bell Cablemedia Plc and NYNEX CableComms , has already signed a deal with General Instrument of the U.S. in an attempt to gain the advantage over satellite broadcaster BSkyB in supplying set-top boxes for digital TV and information services.Telewest , which wants to complete the rollout of its national network by 2000 , also wants to link up its regional areas by the end of this year by laying new lines or leasing lines from other operators.In this way , it can by-pass high interconnection prices charged by dominant telecoms players such as British Telecommunications Plc and Mercury.Capital expenditure over the year rose 31 percent to 515.6 million pounds and Burdick said Telewest expected to spend a similar amount this year .
This year will be another year of substantial build , he said.Telewest said average monthly revenue per cable television subscriber edged up to 22.95 pounds from 21.11 pounds in 1995 , although average residential telephony revenue billed per line slipped to 20.26 pounds from 20.69 pounds because of a tariff price war with BT.In business telephony , attempts to remain competitive helped drive the average revenue per line eight percent lower to 54.5 pounds per month.Telewest , along with other cable companies , has been placed on CreditWatch with negative implications by Standard & amp ; Poor 's credit rating agency because of slower than anticipated network buildouts and competitive pressures from rivals such as BT and BSkyB.Higher-than-expected capital expenditure and debt levels and a delay in operating cash flow generation in the industry has concerned the American agency.But Burdick said Telewest had the best credit rating of all cable companies at BB plus and had had a very productive meeting with S & amp ; P.We expect to have a response as a company and industry at the end of the month , he said .
( $ = 0.629 British Pounds ) Cable and Wireless Communications ( CWC ) , Britain 's new cable telephone and television company , made its market debut on Monday valued at around 4.5 billion pounds ( $ 7.3 billion ) , in line with analyst expectations.A free float of 14.7 percent of the new group , which was formed last year when the Mercury subsidiary of Cable and Wireless Plc merged with the three cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada , started at 300 pence per share and moved up to 306p in early trade.The dual flotation on both the London and New York stock exchanges was scheduled for 1330 GMT to coincide with the opening of the American market.Analysts had expected CWC -- which will provide local , national and international voice , data , multi-channel TV and Internet services -- to be valued at an average of 4.5 billion pounds.Despite bringing together cable TV groups NYNEX CableComms Group , Bell Cablemedia Plc and Videotron , CWC 's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury.Although this makes it British Telecommunications Plc 's biggest rival , some analysts believe that BT , valued at around 28 billion pounds , will have nothing to fear until at least the middle of next decade.Before it rolls out its network , CWC will have only 1.1 million residential and 80,000 business telecom customers compared to BT 's 20.5 million residential and seven million business clients.But with 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure and initial debt of 1.3 billion pounds , CWC plans to complete its sophisticated broadband cable and local telephone networks and offer its services to six million customers by 2001.BT is currently banned from using its comprehensive network for direct broadcasting services.Nevertheless some analysts are cautious about the new company 's prospects.On a longer-term view , any valuation becomes almost entirely dependent on your view of what the longer-term penetration rate is going to be for telephony and cable TV , noted one analyst , who declined to be named.He said BT would move into broadcasting by 2001 at the latest , when current regulatory restrictions are lifted , and the group was likely to move into interactive services such as home shopping and home banking sooner.Put that alongside the impact of BT 's on-going marketing muscle in basic telephony combined with the impact of digital terrestrial TV and digital satellite TV and I think that will all serve to put a break on our expectations of long-term cable TV penetration , he said.But other analysts , such as Richard Jones at brokers Yamaichi and Andrew Harrington at Salomon Brothers , welcomed the transformation of Mercury from a typical telecoms group into a much more exciting and dynamic telephony and entertainment provider.Jones is recommending buying the stock up to 350 pence per share .
Harrington values the shares at 438p and the company at 6.5 billion pounds.Everything BT can do Cable and Wireless Communications can to better and sooner , he said.Harrington argues that CWC 's network cost structure has a competitive advantage against BT , its main rival on the telephony side , and satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc , its main rival on the multi-channel television side.It 's got 50 percent fewer employees per line than BT , he said .
We think CWC has a unique competitive advantage in the provision of multi-channel TV and telephony .
I think it 's going to exceed expectations in the next year.CWC hopes to be first to roll out its 200-television channel service , possibly by autumn.The company will ditch the four brand names and instead use that of its majority shareholder -- Cable and Wireless .
A huge marketing campaign is planned to ensure that the name wins public recognition.Now that the partial flotation is out of the way , analysts will be eyeing Global One , a partnership of Deutsche Telekom AG , France Telecom and America 's Sprint Corp , which needs access to Britain and has been in talks with Cable and Wireless about the CWC venture.The two North American partners in CWC , which together hold a 32.7 percent stake , have not seen great returns for their investments in Britain 's stagnant cable market so far and might be willing to sell all or some of their stakes , some analysts say.But with the privatisation of France Telecom delayed , no imminent deal is expected .
( $ = 0.616 British Pounds ) Cable and Wireless Plc , Britain 's second biggest telecommunications company , reported record annual profits on Wednesday but said it was biding its time before choosing any global partners.C & amp ; W , which confirmed it was still in talks with telecoms alliances such as Global One , said pre-tax profits after exceptional items jumped 12 percent to 1.42 billion pounds ( $ 2.3 billion ) .The company , which raised its total dividend 11 percent to 11.1 pence for the year to March 31 , said improved demand in its businesses around the world and increased productivity had boosted performance.Group turnover , including C & amp ; W 's share of associated undertakings , rose 13 percent to just over 7.0 billion pounds .
Underlying profits were in line with expectations and the shares eased 6.6p to 506p at 1140 GMT.The results were pretty much in line with expectations after stripping out about 180 million pounds of one-offs .
We wo n't be changing our forecasts , ABN AMRO Hoare Govett analyst James Ross said.But C & amp ; W 's chief executive Richard Brown said in the results statement that the company was just beginning to build long-term growth : We are seizing opportunities to expand our revenues in fresh , innovative ways.The company last month merged its British telephone subsidiary Mercury with three cable television companies to create the country 's biggest cable group called Cable and Wireless Communications , which some analysts say will enhance the bottom line within a couple of years.Finance director Robert Lerwill told Reuters in an interview that the group continued to talk with suitors such as the Global One alliance of Deutsche Telekom , France Telecom and America 's Sprint Corp.But he noted : There 's nothing specific on any conversations with Global One worth commenting on.People have been approaching us and are interested in us -- which demonstrates our global reach and the appeal we have for many of these global alliances.Global One is keen to gain access to the British market as well as C & amp ; W 's key Asian business interests including its ace card -- a near-60 percent stake in lucrative Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd.Hong Kong Telecom contributed just over 1.0 billion pounds to annual operating profits and 2.67 billion pounds to group turnover.A partnership with Global One would also allow C & amp ; W to tap the key European telecoms markets , such as France and Germany , which are heading for liberalisation next year.Despite owning a small subsidiary called Cable and Wireless Europe , C & amp ; W has limited access to continental Europe .
If we did in some way get associated with another alliance , then ( continental ) Europe is the place where there is more to go for , Lerwill said.C & amp ; W says it will use Cable and Wireless Communications as its springboard for European expansion.One question mark which hangs over C & amp ; W is its holding in Hong Kong Telecom .
With only weeks to go before the British colony reverts to Chinese control , speculation has been sparked that China may pressure C & amp ; W into reducing its majority stake.But C & amp ; W insists there is no requirement for it do so .
It welcomed more direct Chinese involvement in Hong Kong Telecom last week , seeing it as a sign the Chinese are likely to use the company as their principal telecoms partner in Hong Kong.China Everbright , which reports to China 's State Council , bought a 7.7 percent stake in the Hong Kong company from CITIC Pacific , which is seen by analysts to be more independent.Some analysts expect further Chinese investment in Hong Kong Telecom , combined with new growth opportunities for the Hong Kong firm on the Chinese mainland.But Adrian Goodall , telecoms analyst at SBC Warburg , said : The potential for growth in China is indisputable , although the ability to make attractive returns from investment in that growth may be a tough proposition .
Britain 's new cable giant , Cable and Wireless Communications , said on Monday it might seek further acquisitions as it set the formal stage for what analysts dubbed a fearfully complicated creation and partial flotation.The planned merger of four cable telephone and television companies , announced in October , was detailed in a hefty 800-page document.It brings together Cable and Wireless Plc 's Mercury subsidiary and the British cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada -- NYNEX CableComms , Bell Cablemedia Plc and Videotron.Here we 've formed the ( UK 's ) largest cable company .
So we 've taken the first step in the consolidation of the industry -- and we 'll look at other acquisitions as and when they will arrive , chief executive Graham Wallace told journalists during a telephone conference call.But he added : We have a scale and mass here that gives us a significant advantage .
We certainly do n't need to be any larger.Analysts have valued CWC , which plans to list 14.7 percent of its shares in London and New York in the next few weeks , at between four and seven billion pounds ( $ 6.4 to $ 11.2 billion ) .With dominant telephone giant British Telecommunications Plc restricted from offering broadcast services , CWC 's main rival is cable group Telewest Communications Plc.CWC chairman Richard Brown declined to be drawn on acquisition targets or potential alliance partners and said no talks were being held during the quiet period up to flotation.Brown said CWC , majority owned by Cable and Wireless , was well positioned to achieve long-term growth.We will be customer-led , we will be market-driven , Brown told a news conference .
We will have the necessary scope to achieve real market penetration over technologically advanced networks , he added.Ahead of the listings , the company is prevented from releasing detailed financial information about what it insists are substantial synergy benefits.In the meantime , it is giving what one analyst called tantalising hints about savings.CWC , which will pay no tax for two years , will close most of its seven customer support centres , some national support centres , three of four company headquarters , rationalise its 12,500 workforce and save on marketing.It might also buy Cable and Wireless 's small European unit , Cable and Wireless Europe , which provides communications services in eight western European countries.Although Britain will be its short-term focus , the venture will also be Cable and Wireless 's vehicle for European expansion.While one can clearly see the huge opportunities , it 's very difficult to know what it all adds up to , said James Golob , analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.It would be nice to have a bit more quantification of what the benefits and opportunities really are.With assets worth about 4.5 billion pounds , the new group plans to provide a broad range of local , national and international voice and data services and , in certain regions , multichannel television and internet computer services.It hopes to complete its broadband cable and local telephony networks by investing some 110 million pounds over two years and offer services to more than six million residential customers by 2001 .
It also wants to serve almost all small and medium-sized businesses within its 45 cable franchise areas.The group will spend another 180 million pounds over the same period on so-called set top boxes , with which customers can receive multi-channel television services.Since the merger was announced , talk has mounted that a global telecoms alliance such as the Global One partnership of Deutsche Telekom , France Telecom and America 's Sprint Corp might take a stake in the venture.Newspapers have tipped Bell Canada as being a possible candidate to sell its 14.2 percent stake and end its exposure to Britain 's stagnant cable market.France Telecom confirmed last week that it was in talks with Cable and Wireless about the cable venture becoming the British partner of the Global One alliance.But Wallace declined to comment , saying only that as far as he was aware , Bell Canada was very happy with its investment.Cable and Wireless , which will have a 52.6 percent stake in CWC , wants to remain a majority shareholder and will consider boosting its investment if partners backed out , Wallace said.CWC 's proforma pretax profits jumped to 93 million pounds in the last nine months from 46 million in the 12 months to March 1996 .
Earnings per share doubled to 6.0 pence .
The group does not plan to pay a dividend initially.Around 65 percent of Bell Cablemedia ( BCM ) and 67 percent of NYNEX shareholders have said they would accept the share offer in the new company .
( $ = 0.623 British Pounds ) A plan by disgruntled French luxury goods group LVMH to spin off the brewing , food and burger businesses in a planned merger between Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc is winning some analysts ' sympathy.But Bernard Arnault , the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton , smarting from having been sidelined in a proposed 23.8 billion pound ( $ 39.2 billion ) merger despite his 14.2 percent Guinness stake , has taken the market by surprise.In two share raids he has snapped up a 6.29 percent stake in GrandMet and spent around 800 million pounds in an effort to leverage a better negotiating position , analysts said on Friday.He is now the largest shareholder in both of the hopeful merger partners.A merger between the two British giants to form a new group called GMG Brands brings together an empire stretching from Johnnie Walker and Bell 's whisky , Gordon 's Gin , Smirnoff Vodka , and Guinness ' traditional stount to the Burger King fast food chain , Haagen Dazs ice-cream and Green giant canned vegetables.Despite some concerns that a hurried sale of unrelated businesses might not get the best or prices , most analysts expect GMG Brands to eventually spin off at least Burger King -- which one said stuck out like a sore thumb.The fact is GrandMet has a spirits and food business together and there is n't any clear logical fit , noted one analyst , who declined to be named .
So perhaps on that basis it would seem sensible to spin it off.Analysts said the added value in the planned merger , which is awaiting European and U.S. regulatory clearance , was clearly in the spirits division.But the food businesses are also more than mere chicken feed .
Excluding Burger King , they could be worth 5.0-6.0 billion pounds -- on conservative estimates , some said .
And that cash could be spent in emerging markets in an earnings enhancing way.I think there is added value putting the sprits divisions together , noted another analyst .
By spinning off the other pieces , LVMH ... wants to capture as much of that extra value for its own shareholders as it possibly can.Separately , credit rating agency Standard & amp ; Poor 's on Friday placed its 'A-1'-plus commercial paper rating of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton ( LVMH ) on CreditWatch with negative implications following announcement of LVMH 's increased stake in GrandMet and its intention to exercise its option to purchase the 34 percent stake in Moet Hennessy owned by Guinness PLC.S & amp ; P said the acquisitions would place further pressure on the French company 's existing financial profile , which had already been stretched in 1996 by the purchase of a 61 percent stake in Duty Free Shopping.It said the move also reflected uncertainties regarding the possibility that LVMH may further increase its stake in GrandMet to obtain a blocking position regarding the proposed Guinness merger.While Arnault piles up his bargaining chips amid mounting speculation that he may raise his GrandMet stake to 10 percent , U.S. competition authorities requested more information on the planned merger.The European Commission , which has until 2200 GMT to decide whether to conduct a second-stage probe , is expected to follow suit.In the meantime , Arnault can convene an extraordinary general meeting if he raises his stake to 10 percent , and put his views to shareholders and the board.But in order to block the bid , he needs more than 24 percent of GrandMet shares.While analysts and the companies are braced for LVMH 's next move , few believe it realistic to expect the French company to buy such a large stake despite its threats .
Such a move would push the price up too high , only to fall back significantly once the bid was blocked , they said.I do n't think that 's a viable strategy , noted one.While GrandMet was holed up in a meeting and unavailable to comment , Guinness said only that as far as it was concerned , it was pressing ahead with the merger.We are confident it will go through at the end of the year and we 're watching the developments with interest , a company spokesman said.By 1210 GMT , GrandMet shares were trading at 598p , a loss of 5-1/2p , while Guinness stock slipped 6-1/2p to 598-1/2p. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ( $ = 0.607 British Pounds ) The Clinton administration has crafted a plan to reform what many call outdated U.S. banking laws and will begin making its positions known over the next few weeks , industry officials said Monday.The administration will formally unveil its plan when Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testifies at a House Banking Committee hearing June 3 , but details of the plan are expected to emerge as early as this week , the officials said.Under Secretary John Hawke , a leading architect of the administration plan , is slated to speak here on Wednesday .
In his speech , Hawke may indicate the administration 's stand on mixing banking and commerce , lobbyists said.Mr .
Hawke certainly wo n't do anything to upstage Rubin , one lobbyist in contact with the administration noted .
But we will hear generally where they are on some of these topics.While most in Congress and the finance industry agree that the Depression-era barriers separating banking from securities and insurance should be torn down , there is little consensus about going farther and allowing banks to combine with securities and other firms.The administration 's position has evolved over the past several months .
A task force on financial reform headed by Hawke initially recommended eliminating all barriers.But the specter of Citicorp or Chase Manhattan merging with General Motors Corp. or Microsoft Corp. drew strong protests from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach of Iowa , as well as prominent labour and consumer groups.And during the spring , several Democratic senators , led by Paul Sarbanes of Maryland , wrote to Rubin to register their opposition to mixing banking and commerce.Bowing somewhat to the criticism , the administration is now said to favour allowing limited combinations .
Financial firms would be limited to a basket of non-financial activity , expressed as a percentage of total revenue or capital , some lobbyists said.But the basket could be further limited by prohibiting combinations of the largest financial and non-financial firms .
For example , one approach would be to bar the 1,000 biggest commercial firms from owning or being owned by banks.Another difficult issue concerns regulating disparate financial businesses within a diversified firm.Almost everyone favours functional regulation , meaning that each activity of a firm would be regulated by the appropriate regulator .
The Securities and Exchange Commission would regulate securities activities while state insurance regulators would oversee insurance sales , for example.But debate continues about the level of federal intrusion in insurance regulation as well as the need for a top-level regulator to oversee entire firms.While some favour setting the Federal Reserve at the top of the heap , the administration is expected to back a committee approach .
The committee would be composed of representatives of the various functional regulators .
Commuters stuck in traffic on the Leesburg Pike in Northern Virginia are just a few hundred yards away from an even bigger jam , one that stretches around the world.This is a traffic jam of bits and bytes , digital data travelling through one of the main arteries of the global Internet.With thousands of new users signing on every day , the Internet 's data routes are brimming with traffic and some predict the imminent demise of the net due to overcrowding.Demand for the Internet is outstripping supply , said Mark Luker , programme director of the National Science Foundation 's network infrastructure project.But work is under way to provide more capacity through technical solutions and ways are being explored to ration the Internet by price , through fees based on the speed and quantity of data.The facility in Northern Virginia is a computer interchange , called Mae East , where 46 major and minor Internet service providers come together to exchange data travelling across the Internet.BUSIEST PUBLIC EXCHANGE POINT ON THE INTERNET , FIRM SAYSMFS Communications Inc , which runs Mae East and its California counterpart Mae West , describes it as the busiest public exchange point on the Internet .
Peak loads run as high as 53 million bytes per second.Until April 1995 , the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) managed and financed the common highway underpinning most of the Internet , called a network backbone.Before the network was phased out in favour of privately managed networks , traffic increased steadily from 1.3 trillion bytes a month in March 1991 to a high of 17.8 trillion bytes in late 1994 , the equivalent of transfering the entire contents of the Library of Congress every four months.The private system sends data across a host of different company networks and crowded interchange points .
As the load continues to increase , MFS and the Internet providers can add more fibre optic lines and switching equipment , but that is expensive and still may fail to keep up with rising usage.Some providers are setting up smaller , one-to-one interchanges to relieve the burden on Mae East .
MCI Communications , which has seen a 5,000 percent increase in Internet traffic since the beginning of 1995 , set up 22 circuits for one-to-one exchanges.For now , the best solution is to keep adding hardware , said Luker .
But in the long run , you can solve problems by adding knowledge to the system instead of brute force , he said.The NSF recently announced 13 grants for the development of high speed networking technologies and software programmes.IDEAS TO REDUCE CONGESTIONOne project hopes to reduce congestion by developing a system , called caching , to hold copies of popular sites at duplicate locations around the world.If an Internet user in Japan tries to download a web page in New York , the data must travel all the way around the world , even if another user in Japan has just downloaded the same page .
With a cache , the second user could grab the page from a closer computer that the data had already gone through.A cache automatically duplicates the pages that are used most often , Luker explained .
The NSF had sponsored a study at the National Laboratory for Advanced Networking Research of a cache that is showing great improvements in traffic.A procedure called multicasting could also reduce repetitive data transfers , said Robert Hagens , MCI 's director of Internet engineering .
Multicasting sends a stream of data such as sound or video across the net that can be accessed by many users.If you look at the radio stations beginning to appear on the Internet , they commonly require each listener to open a connection to the station so you 've got a lot of duplication , Hagens said .
With multicast , you put that data into a stream of packets that only get duplicated when they have to.New ways of charging for Internet usage may alter the traffic patterns , as well .
At the moment , most users pay a flat rate for Internet service regardless of how much capacity they use .
Sending e-mail is considerably less taxing than sending live videos , but users pay the same for both.The Internet is a mature technology but an immature economy , said Hal Varian , dean of the University of California 's School of Information Management and Systems .
The current pricing model does not provide incentives to Internet providers to offer high quality service , he said.People who need high priority channels for sending live video might have to pay more , Varian said , but basic tasks like sending e-mail will remain essentially free.Varian also predicted Internet service providers will begin paying each other based on the amount of traffic they exchange , much as phone carriers make settlement payments to foreign telecommunications companies for completing international calls.Much of the slowdown experienced by individuals trying to surf the World Wide Web is caused by limits at each end of a connection rather than by delays moving across the network.Web pages reside on computer servers that can be overwhelmed when too many requests arrive at the same time .
And many individuals access the Internet through relatively slow modem links.Such delays could be eased by a proposal from Sun Microsystems to create a new Internet standard for the way computers access each others ' files.Called Web Network File System , the protocol reduces the burden on the computer holding the web pages , speeding the transfer of files and allowing three times as many Internet surfers to gain access at one time , according to Sanjay Sinha , head of Sun 's Solaris Server project.In real life , most web servers are heavily loaded , Sinha said .
Sun 's web file system does n't require that load.User delays are real , but by some measures the Internet 's performance has actually improved over the last few years.Matrix Information and Directory Services of Austin , Texas , compiles a weather report which it publishes on the Internet.The report , updated every four hours , shows how long it takes a small message to travel from Matrix 's headquarters to 4,500 major computers around the world and back.Traffic clogging the Internet slows the round trips .
The reports show huge fluctuations in Internet traffic , with rush hour occuring weekdays as business users log on.But the average delay declined by 30 percent between January 1994 and January 1996 , according a report by Matrix .
A bill to protect homeowners from paying unneccessary mortgage insurance was passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representative Wednesday.By a vote of 421 to seven , the House adopted the Homeowners Insurance Protection Act that would cancel mortgage insurance once the homeowner has built up sufficient equity.The truth is that a vast number of people are paying for insurance they no longer need , Representative Henry Gonzalez said during the debate on the bill .
The Texas Democrat urged the Senate to quickly pass the measure.Consumer advocates say these policies cost homeowners millions of dollars a year.I think it would be hard for the Senate to resist moving forward , Michelle Meier , counsel for government affairs at Consumers Union , said .
The House vote brings us really close to getting a final measure.But the mortgage insurance industry warned that the automatic cancellation proposal would raise the cost for loans with low downpayments.Unfortunately , the bill has serious flaws that would impose unnecessary government mandates and controls on the industry , said Suzanne Hutchinson of the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.Currently , mortgage lenders require a borrower to obtain and pay for such insurance when the borrower is making a relatively small down payment , such as 5 percent of the purchase price of a home.Borrowers putting down 20 percent or more of the purchase price generally are not required to obtain insurance , which can cost $ 300 to $ 900 a year.The bill would automatically cancel a mortgage insurance policy if the homeowner was current on mortgage payments and had built up 25 percent equity of the original house value.The bill would not not apply to existing mortgages .
The new rules would cover only mortgages and refinancings closed a year after enactment .
U.S. lawmakers redrafting a legislative proposal to modernize U.S. banking laws will rely heavily on the Clinton administration 's reform plan , congressional staffers said on Wednesday.But whatever provisions end up in the new draft , expected to be finished by Friday , the real battle will be fought when the House Banking Committee begins its formal consideration , or mark up , of the proposal currently scheduled for next week .
The goal here is to get in the ( bill ) those areas where there is general agreement , committee spokesman David Runkel said.The intent is to use as much of the Treasury ( Department 's ) language as appropriate , Runkel said .
The most controversial questions will be resolved as lawmakers offer varied amendments during the mark up , he added.Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin unveiled the administration 's plan to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws in a speech on May 21 .
In testimony on Tuesday , Rubin urged Congress to scrap the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and free banks to enter other financial sectors like insurance and securities underwriting.At least four major areas of disagreement remain that will be the focus of the scheduled June 11 mark up , staffers said .
Some lawmakers want the mark up delayed at least a week , however , so the session could be delayed.First , wide differences of opinion exist among legislators about whether financial firms should be allowed to engage in nonfinancial , commercial activities .
The administration ducked the difficult question , offering two alternatives instead .
Three earlier bills also each took a different approach and numerous alternatives have been floated in recent weeks .
You 'll see it all at the mark up , one staffer predicted.Also , the insurance industry is up in arms about provisions in the administration plan that may broaden a 1996 Supreme Court decision limiting state regulation of bank insurance sales .
The bill would allow federal bank regulators to overrule state insurance authorities in some instances.This could have the effect of threatening the safety and soundness of the nation 's insurance system , said David Pratt , senior vice president of the American Insurance Association .
A third controversey sprouted from one of the administration 's two alternatives on banking and commerce.The plan said Congress could allow limited mixing or keep the current prohibition while also maintaining the present exception allowing commercial companies to own thrifts.Under the second option , thrifts and banks would continue to operate under different federal charters .
That outraged the banking industry , which thought it made a deal last year guaranteeing the charters would be merged .
A very critical piece if the puzzle will be that any financial reform measure specifically deals with the thrift charter issue , said Beth Climo , group director of financial industry affairs at the American Bankers Association.That is the fundamental thing that needs to be addressed , Climo said.Another area of disagreement surrounds proposals to allow creation of so-called wholesale financial institutions , or woofies .
These bank-like entities could only take deposits over $ 100,000 and would not receive deposit insurance.Some opponents of mixing banking and commerce fear that wholesale banks represent a significant loophole , since a commercial company could set up a woofie.Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach said earlier this week that he hoped to have the committee approve a bill and send it to the House floor by July 4.But even if a majority of the banking panel can reach a consensus , the bill will be sequentially referred to the House Commerce Committee .
That committee could then hold its own mark up or even stall the legislation .
( ( -- Washington Newsroom 202-898-8312 ) ) Sun Microsystem Inc 's decision to use powerful computer encoding software made in Russia put added pressure on the Clinton administration on Monday to relax strict U.S. export controls on similiar products made by American companies.Encryption products , which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software key , have become a critical component of global communications and online commerce over the Internet .
But encryption 's power to prevent hackers from snooping on telephone calls and credit card numbers sent over the Internet can also be employed by drug cartels or terrorists to thwart law enforcement survellience.Clinton administration officials oppose allowing exports of powerful U.S. encryption programs unless the software is designed to allow the government to crack the codes by gaining access to the software keys.Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh and others have said repeatedly that the encryption genie is not yet out of the bottle .
It 's an arguably legal way around what is clearly a ludicrous export control policy of the administration that is creating jobs in Russia , Rep. Bob Goodlatte said in a telephone interview.Goodlatte , Republican of Virginia , introduced one of several measures being considered by Congress to relax the export controls .
The bill was passed by the House Judiciary Committee last week and is awaiting action by the International Relations Committee.If U.S. export restrictions stay in place , industry officials warned , other companies will go the same route.A lot of U.S. companies have been contemplating this , said Jon Englund , vice president at the Information Technology Association of America .
Sun 's move is the first example of a trend that will continue .
We 'll see more and more of that.Administration officials had no comment on the Sun announcement .
( ( 202-898-8312 ) ) Legislation to dramatically relax U.S. export restrictions on computer encoding technology moved ahead on Wednesday as the House Judiciary Committee approved the measure.The bill , known as the Security and Freedom through Encryption Act , now goes to the House International Relations Committee where opponents plan to make their stand.Encryption , computer programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software key , has become an essential component of global communications and electronic commerce over the Internet.The Clinton administration has opposed the bill and similiar measures in the Senate , arguing that allowing strong encryption out of the country will put it in the hands of international criminals and terrorists.Representative Bob Goodlatte , the bill 's author , said he had spoken to administration officials on Tuesday and hoped a compromise could be reached.We 're very , very close in many areas , the Virginia Republican told reporters after the committee vote .
The export control issue is probably the area that we 're still the furthest apart on.After the votes , administration officials emphasised the differences .
Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said the administration is disappointed that the committee acted precipitously .
The bill contains serious deficiencies.Goodlatte 's bill also would write into law the current policy of allowing unrestricted domestic use of encryption.The bill would criminalize the use of encryption to conceal information related to the commission of a felony.Software industry officials and privacy advocates , who have strongly opposed the export limits , urged lawmakers to continue moving the legislation forward.The International Relations Committee will have a go at it but it 's great to have some momentum , Netscape Communications Corp. public policy counsel Peter Harter told Reuters after the vote .
We 've come a long way in a very short period of time .
This legislation is moving at Internet time.Jonah Seiger , communications director at the Centre for Democracy and Technology , said the vote was a historic moment.The Judiciary Committee agreed that the administration has the wrong policy sending a very clear signal that we need to change direction , Seiger said.Before the vote , committee chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois prohibited amendments to the bill on the controversial export section .
Hyde said the export section fell under the jurisdiction of the International Relations Committee .
The Federal Reserve may not be taking adequate precautions to ensure that its technological systems and those of the banks it regulates will function properly in the year 2000 , Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato warned Monday.After querying U.S. bank regulators on the year 2000 computer issue in February , New York Republican D'Amato said he was troubled by the answers he received from the Fed and the National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) .Problems are expected to crop up in computers and software that only record the last two digits of the year .
Such a programme might treat the year 2000 as the year 1900 , leading to serious miscalculations or even a system crash.D'Amato also queried in February the Office of the Comptroller , which oversees national banks , and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
Both entities told D'Amato they had detailed plans to cope with the so-called millennium bug.But D'Amato singled out responses of the Fed and the NCUA as raising concerns over whether they are devoting enough attention and resources to solving the year 2000 crisis , D'Amato 's office said in a release .
D'Amato sent both agencies letters Monday asking for additional information.Congress expects detailed plans and concrete actions to prevent possible future catastrophes which could endanger the financial well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans , D'Amato said .
We ca n't wait around , timing is critical.Estimates for fixing year 2000 problems in government and the private sector worldwide have ranged as high as $ 300 billion to $ 600 billion .
Chase Manhattan Bank recently said in a routine filing it planned to spend $ 250 million on the problem over the next three years.We have no comment , Fed spokesman Joe Coyne said Monday .
We will , of course , answer the letter.D'Amato said the Fed and the NCUA appeared to lack an aggressive plan of action for coping with the problem , failed to give an assessment about the scope of the problem in institutions they oversee , and did not explain how they would assist regulated institutions that might have a problem.The Fed , which operates the nation 's payment system moving $ 1 trillion a day among financial institutions , also failed to describe any steps it had taken to ensure that its own systems would be ready for the year 2000 , D'Amato said .
The Clinton administration gave a solid boost this week to congressional efforts to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws but substantial hurdles remain , participants in the debate said.On Wednesday , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the administration 's plan to eliminate the 1933 Glass-Steagall legal barriers separating banks from securities firms and insurance companies.The administration plan was due to Congress by March 31 and the nearly two-month delay had some lobbyists fearing that the administration would avoid the tangled regulatory controversies and not submit anything.Congress has sought to reform banking laws for more than a decade , but one interest group or another has always managed to block passage of legislation .
In prior years , banks sought reform , while other financial firms opposed change.Recently , courts and regulators have granted banks new authority , however .
That brought insurance companies and securities firms to the table to seek a level playing field.There is renewed hope that the 105th Congress will tackle this difficult issue , said David Farmer , lobbyist for the Alliance of American Insurers , after Rubin 's speech.The action now shifts to the Banking committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate , where detailed reform measures will be drafted .
Rubin will provide more details of the Clinton plan in testimony before Congress on June 3.House Banking Committee Chairman James Leach said this week that drafting will begin immediately after that testimony and that he wants committee action completed by mid-June.It is at the drafting stage where some past efforts to reform banking laws have foundered as competing interests fought over the details.The new administration proposal ducked one of the most contentious issues -- whether banks should be allowed to combine with non-financial , commercial firms.Instead of taking sides , Rubin offered two alternatives .
Under one plan , banks would be allowed a limited amount of commercial activity , but the largest 1,000 commercial companies could not own or be owned by banks.Under a second alternative , the current prohibition would be continued , but the current exception allowing savings and loans to be owned by commercial companies would also be maintained.Several months ago , administration officials were discussing proposals to allow nearly unlimited mixing of banking and commerce .
The apparent retreat left advocates of greater mixing fuming.Their recommendation is tantamount to surrender on the issue , Minnesota Democrat Rep. Bruce Vento said.Vento and New Jersey Republican Rep. Marge Roukema introduced a bill in January that would allow banks to have a basket of commercial activity accounting for up to 25 percent of an institution 's total business.Another blow to Vento and Roukema 's efforts came Thursday when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the House Banking Committee.Greenspan said Congress should eliminate Glass-Steagall now , but put off the banking and commerce issue for future review .
Any wider authorization of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernization , he said.Now the banking and commerce issue threatens to derail their backing , said bank consultant Karen Shaw Petrou , president of ISD/Shaw Inc.The administration 's plan is a decent baby-step , Petrou said .
But unsurprisingly , it 's not the lightning bolt that transforms the debate.Securities firms and insurance companies are involved in commercial activity , but want to get into banking if banks are allowed into their fields.If you do n't allow banking and commerce , then you create obstacles for non-banks , Petrou said .
But somebody 's twist or turn to solve that then creates another problem for someone else.Even a small percentage limit on commercial activity would accommodate the largest non-bank financial companies , according to research from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released on Thursday.Among the seven securities firms in the Fortune 1000 , plus Goldman Sachs & amp ; Co. , none earned much more than 5 percent of their revenue from commercial activity in 1996 , the FDIC estimated.Only one of the five largest life and health insurers and one of the five largest property and casualty firms exceeded the 5 percent level , the FDIC said.Four of the 10 largest diversified financial firms would exceed the 5 percent level , however .
American Express derived 9 to 14 percent of its revenue from commercial activities , for example , and Marsh & amp ; McLennan Cos Inc. had 28 percent of revenues from commerce .
Senator Bob Kerrey is preparing legislation in an attempt to break the deadlock over computer encryption export policy , people familiar with the Senator 's plans said.Until now , the debate has pitted the Clinton administration , which favors strict export controls , against U.S. software companies and civil libertarians , who want to relax the export limits.Encryption programs scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software key .
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , outlining a plan to overhaul Depression-era laws governing the U.S. financial sector , said Wednesday the Clinton administration favored allowing banks to enter the securities and insurance fields.The old lines that separated insurance , securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared , Rubin said in a speech here.The highly anticipated administration proposal , originally expected in March , takes its place with several bills already introduced in Congress .
We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative , Rubin said.Increased competition in financial services should benefit consumers , generating savings of up to $ 15 billion a year , Rubin said.The new proposal did not take a firm position on the controversial question of allowing banks to combine with non-financial , commercial firms.Because of the nature of the issues and the complete lack of consensus , we think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress before settling on a final approach , Rubin said.Some lawmakers , along with smaller banks and consumer groups , adamantly oppose allowing banks to combine with commercial firms .
But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted.Rubin outlined two possible approaches .
Under one approach , some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded.Under a second approach , no mixing would be allowed with banks but , as currently permitted , thrifts would be allowed to combine with commercial firms.If banks are allowed to mix with commercial firms , the reforms could take effect two years after enactment , Rubin said .
If mixing is not allowed , the reforms could take effect in nine months.The Federal Reserve should continue to oversee bank holding companies , while specific activities would be overseen by specific regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators.Banks would be allowed to underwrite municipal revenue bonds .
An exemption for banks in the federal mutual fund law , the Investment Company Act , would be narrowed .
Australia 's biggest bank , National Australia Bank , on Thursday reported record half-year net earnings but said it felt vulnerable to foreign takeover.Unveiling a A $ 1.14 billion ( US $ 885 million ) profit for the six months ended March 31 , managing director Don Argus suggested a government freeze on mergers between the four big local banks had exposed all of them to the threat of foreign takeover.He said NAB felt vulnerable.I certainly do , particularly when some of our friendly merchant banks from the Northern Hemisphere tell you that you 're at the top of the 'Hit Parade ' , Argus told reporters.The most profitable of Australia 's banks and ranked its top bank by KPMG management consultancy , NAB has been seen as a likely predator if big bank mergers in Australia are approved.But the freeze remains despite an official inquiry into the Australian financial system recommending last month that the big banks as well as major life offices be allowed to merge.The government wants the ban on big-bank mergers to stay until competition widens and intensifies .
But it has opened the way for a foreign bank to swoop on one of the big four.Argus on Thursday criticised the government 's position , warning competition was unrelenting and would put the group 's ability to deliver further record profits under pressure.The warning sparked sell orders on NAB shares , which ended at $ A18.11 on Thursday , down 23 cents on Wednesday 's close but still at historical highs.Offshore income bolstered NAB 's performance , with earnings growth from its six bank subsidiaries in the United Kingdom , Ireland , the United States and New Zealand.Even Asia , a small part of NAB 's international business , has begun to put its head up now with some decent black figures , Argus said .
Net profit from the Asian business more than doubled to A $ 15 million from A $ 6 million a year ago.Offshore income now accounts for 37 percent of NAB 's net earnings .
This offers the bank some protection from Australia 's fragile housing market and will ensure it continues to outperform its domestic rivals , banking analysts said.All the banks are doing it very tough in Australia at the moment , a Melbourne-based analyst said.Argus said NAB would start to feel the pinch of lower interest rates in the curent half-year , ending September 30 , but felt the bank could match last year 's second-half result.We would like to think we could , he said.If so , NAB would achieve a record annual net profit of about A $ 2.24 billion , just under state-owned telecommunication carrier Telstra 's Australian record profit of A $ 2.3 billion in 1995/96 ( July/June ) .
( A $ 1 = US $ 0.7760 ) Australia 's Trust Bank said on Friday a locally listed insurer and two offshore institutions had expressed interest in buying a 49 percent stake in the bank.Trust Bank managing director Paul Kemp declined to name the three groups but said such an early response to the bank 's quest for a long-term strategic partner was a good sign.We have had three expressions that are potentially worth listening to , Kemp told Reuters .
They were from a local insurer , an unlisted offshore insurer and another offshore financial instution , thought to be a bank , which approached the Trust Bank through an intermediary.Tasmania-based Trust Bank announced in March that it was looking for a strategic partner to take a 49 percent stake , hopefully by early 1998.The bank then plans to issue 41 percent of its equity to the public by the end of 1998 and embark on national expansion.Trust Bank is effectively owned by a community trust and , like mutual societies , has no shareholders .
It has net assets of A $ 143 million , implying a total value of A $ 257 million , based on the goodwill paid in the sale of another regional Australian bank , BankWest Ltd , in 1995.One insurance analyst said the most likely local insurer to have expressed an interest in taking a stake in Trust Bank was Sydney-based GIO Australia Holdings Ltd.National Mutual Holdings Ltd has ruled out any interest in acquiring a banking licence , saying it is no longer worth paying a premium due to convergence in the industry.Colonial Ltd already owns a bank .
The analyst said it was unlikely any of the other seven listed insurers would be interested.I imagine it 's probably GIO , but it does n't sound to me like it would be a big issue whether it got it or not , the Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters.The value of a bank to an insurer would be the bank 's distribution network , the analyst said.But Trust Bank 's branch network is confined mainly to Tasmania state , its home market.It has just four branches outside Tasmania .
Trust Bank 's Kemp said the bank would soon choose a big global accountancy firm to help it identify a partner .
It is also drafting an information memorandum for potential partners.Kemp insisted a banking licence was still a valuable asset for non-bank institutions .
You are going to get an immediate foothold in the Australian market place , he said.You are going to acquire a franchise which has considerable value , you are going to get a distribution network .
You are going to hire a level of expertise , he said .
Trust Bank has ruled out any of the other local banks as a strategic partner , saying none of them would be interested in fulfilling Trust bank 's broader ambitions. -- Melbourne Bureau 613-9286-1421 Australia 's Woodside Petroleum Ltd on Wednesday announced it would ramp up exploration spending this year as it sought to diversify away from the lucrative gas fields of the North West Shelf.Woodside unveiled its aggressive exploration programme for calendar 1997 , much of its centred outside the offshore North West Shelf fields , after reporting a 58 percent surge in annual net earnings to A $ 191 million for 1996.Woodside 's shares shot up on the profit announcement , which was in line with market expectations .
The stock closed at the day 's high of A $ 8.97 on Wednesday , up 31 cents on Tuesday 's close , confirming the market 's bright view of Woodside.Woodside said it would more than double exploration spending in 1997 to a record A $ 120 million with over half of this being thrown at the company 's interests in the Timor Sea.Certainly this is an order-of-magnitude increase in non-North West Shelf exploration activity , Akehurst told a news conference in Melbourne.Woodside plans to drill 12 to 14 exploration wells , including eight or nine outside the North West Shelf , he added .
Akehurst also announced in North West Shelf 's proven reserves , with ultimate gas recovery leaping 60 percent to 24.4 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) at the end of 1996.Oil reserves rose 11 percent to 175 million barrels and condensate reserves were up 21 percent to 690 million barrels.Woodside expressed confidence the North West Shelf would meet the 30 tcf in gas reserves needed to justify a doubling of LNG capacity to meet growing demand from Japanese customers.Quite clearly we see considerable upside ... , Akehurst said , citing estimated possible reserves of 45 tcf .
Equal partners in the North West Shelf are Woodside , The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd , The British Petroleum Co Plc , Japan Australia LNG ( MiMi ) Pty Ltd , a partnership of Mitsui & amp ; Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp , Chevron Corp and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.The six partners plan to double annual LNG production to 14 million tonnes by 2003 at a capital cost of A $ 6 billion.The North West Shelf partners and owners of the nearby Gorgon gas field have been discussing the prospects of merging the two developments , with a view to expanding the North West Shelf 's existing LNG plant further .
I think the exciting prospect is to see how we can move on from there and look for opportunities with third parties to expand that project , Akehurst said.He said he would welcome any proposal to merge Gorgon with North West Shelf production to cooperate on a sixth and seventh train .
Currently , the North West Shelf partners plan to expand their Burrup Pensinsula plant to five trains.Chevron , Texaco Inc and Shell each hold two-seventh stakes in Gorgon , with Mobil Corp owning one-seventh. -- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421 Australian steel-maker The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd ( BHP ) on Tuesday announced the closure of Australia 's oldest steel-making plant , an industrial icon which it said could no longer match its Asian competitors.BHP 's Newcastle mill , a milestone in the nation 's industrial development when opened in 1915 , will shut down its blast furnaces by the end of 1999 as part of a major overhaul of BHP 's global steel business , the company said .
BHP chief executive John Prescott , who like his predecessors forged his early career at Newcastle , was unsentimental in announcing the closure , which will end 2,500 workers ' jobs.The fundamental purpose of all the change is to ensure a viable industry going forward , Prescott told reporters.We are not walking away from the steel industry , he added.BHP now faces possible industrial action from trade unions , one of which said the closure would directly and indirectly destroy up to 12,000 jobs Australia wide .
A mass meeting of Newcastle workers at the site next Friday is expected to consider calling a strike against the company , an Australian Workers Union ( AWU ) official said.The AWU 's Newcastle secretary , Mauri Rudd , told Reuters that a strike , if called , would try to block BHP exports.BHP , Australia 's biggest company , is also a major exporter of Australian coal , iron ore , liquefied natural gas and manganese .
The world 's biggest miner , RTZ-CRA , announced a major realignment of its sprawling empire on Wednesday and removed any doubt that London was its capital.The group , born of a 1995 merger of London-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd , said it would now manage its global businesses along six main product lines.These were aluminium , copper , energy , industrial minerals , iron ore , and gold and other minerals .
Together they reaped revenues of around US $ 8 billion for the group in calendar 1996 from operations on all six continents.RTZ-CRA said it would shrink its Melbourne office , CRA 's home base and until now the group 's other headquarters .
It will halve the staff there , shedding 100 jobs , and leave the office with a support role only .
A total of 200 jobs will go worldwide.The announcement provoked an angry response in parts of the Australian press .
One newspaper said that CRA had been buried under the RTZ shake-up.CRA chairman John Uhrig said that the merger , which maintained the two firms ' separate listings , had so far not produced a better outcome for shareholders.It would have been surprising if it had in its first year of operation , Uhrig told a news conference in Melbourne.In London , RTZ-CRA executive chairman Robert Wilson told reporters the group would take a one-off restructuring charge of US $ 40 million this year , and expected to gain annual cost savings of $ 50 million to $ 60 million by 1998.The reorganisation leaves Australian-based executives to manage the aluminium , energy and iron ore businesses from Brisbane , Melbourne and Perth .
London handles the rest and remains the sole group headquarters.The Salt Lake City office of its Kennecott copper operation in the United States as well as the group 's Johannesburg office would be closed , the company said.The new structure shifts the focus of management away from a geographical view of the world , where operations differ by country , toward a single management for each global business.It ensures RTZ-CRA does not become an unwieldy bureaucracy unable to compete with more nimble rivals which deal in just one commodity , the group said.RTZ-CRA is a big company by the standards of the industry , executive chairman Wilson said .
We are striving to obtain benefits of scale without the bureaucracy that goes very often with size.Chief executive Leon Davis gave examples where , under the current structure , copper operations and coal mines were under several different leaderships across the globe.These are barriers that are artificially created and we are intent on removing them , Davis told the news conference.It will eliminate duplication , lower our costs and improve our efficiency , he added.Mining analysts welcomed the move .
One viewed it as confirmation the RTZ-CRA marriage , made without any shares actually changing hands , was effectively a cheap buy-out of CRA.If anyone thought the DLC ( dual-listed structure ) was anything other than a buy-out on the cheap , they should assess this little move because they are virtually wiping out Melbourne head office , a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters.The analyst said he expected the group to eventually transform the dual-listed structure into the one company , although in London Wilson denied that the changes would undermine the dual-structure.RTZ-CRA has already proposed to ditch its double-barrelled name and become known , subject to shareholder approval this year , as Rio Tinto .
RTZ 's shares would then trade in London as Rio Tinto Plc and CRA 's stock in Australia as Rio Tinto Ltd.A Melbourne-based analyst said the cementing of London as the group 's headquarters came as no surprise .
It does n't make any sense to have two head offices , he said .
Australian banking and insurance group Colonial Ltd hopes to make a strong share-market debut on Monday after major investors rushed its A $ 690 million ( US $ 535 million ) float.On the eve of its listing on the Australian and New Zealand exchanges , Colonial announced it had priced the share offer at A $ 3.10 per share for institutional investors , well above the shares ' net asset backing of A $ 2.48 each.Colonial had given an indicative range of between A $ 2.50 and A $ 2.90 as a guide to institutions , but on Sunday it said the limited number of shares on offer drew bids well above that.Institutional bids closed on Friday.Of the total 235 million shares on offer , institutions could bid for only two-thirds , ensuring they paid a handsome premium to the price paid by retail investors in the first stage of the offer.Colonial sold shares to members of the public for a fixed price of A $ 2.60 each this month .
Each share , for both retail and institutional shareholders , comes with an option to buy more.We are delighted ... , Colonial managing director Peter Smedley told a news conference in Melbourne.One would hope for a premium over the institutional price ( on listing ) , he added.Colonial becomes only the second life office to list on the Australian Stock Exchange , after one of its bigger rivals , National Mutual Holdings Ltd , listed last October.Australia 's biggest , the Australian Mutual Provident Society ( AMP ) , will soon follow .
It plans to shed its old mutual structure and list in Australia and New Zealand next year.Colonial has total assets of A $ 29.7 billion and is the only local life office with a bank , Sydney-based Colonial State Bank.It will list with a register of over 500,000 shareholders , including its former Asian insurance partner , Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd , which has secured a major stake.Colonial will use some of the proceeds of the float to fund its recent decision to buy out Jardine 's half interest in their Asian business for US $ 163 million.Colonial has , like National Mutual , focused on Asia to grow its business.It has applied for a licence to sell life insurance in China and has operations across Southeast Asia , including Hong Kong , Singapore , Indonesia , the Philippines and Thailand .
Its traditional offshore markets are Britain , New Zealand and Fiji.Colonial 's Smedley indicated on Sunday the company had tried to weed out the stags from the long-term investors in the float.He said Colonial had tried to identify investors perceived to be long term when allocating shares to institutions .
Industrial conglomerate Pacific Dunlop Ltd will announce another heavy fall in annual net profit on Friday , with abnormal losses possibly sinking the bottom line into red ink , stock analysts said on Thursday.PacDun , dogged by litigation over problems with its U.S.-made cardiac implants and by weak economic growth at home and abroad , has already softened the blow by warning investors last May that annual profit would be 35 percent lower .
The warning pared forecasts of pre-abnormal net profit down to an average of A $ 162 million for the year to June 30 , said BZW Investment Management 's BARCEPS forecasting service.This compares with a 1994/95 pre-abnormal result of A $ 251 million and a first-half pre-abnormal result of A $ 118 million.But the group -- a major international producer of rubber consumer goods , car batteries and tyres , industrial cables and clothing -- is likely to book a large net abnormal loss of up to A $ 300 million , Macquarie Equities analyst Greg Dring said .
Pacific Dunlop 's troubled U.S. medical equipment unit , Telectronics , which accounted for A $ 60.5 million in abnormal losses in 1994/1995 , will again incur big provisions for costs associated with its pacemaker leads , he said.Dring estimated that these provisions could account in 1995/96 for about A $ 200 million of a total net abnormal loss estimated at up to A $ 300 million , he added .
He said he assumed the group would not book a tax benefit on these losses .
French insurance giant Axa-UAP is to be awarded a coveted licence to sell life insurance to China 's emerging middle classes , the group 's Asian subsidiary said on Friday.Australian-based National Mutual Holdings Ltd , owned 51 percent by Axa-UAP , said Chinese authorities had advised its parent verbally that a licence would be granted.The announcement , which confirmed a Reuter report from Shanghai on Tuesday , sent the shares of National Mutual to a record high on the expectation it would run the China business.Shares in National Mutual Asia Ltd , the Hong Kong-listed Asian business arm of National Mutual , were also firmer.Obviously it 's good that the greater Axa group of companies has secured a licence to operate in China , National Mutual Holdings managing director Geoff Tomlinson told Reuters.But he cautioned investors in National Mutual not to get too excited about the announcement , saying it was not clear if the National Mutual group would play any role in Axa 's success.The licence itself could still be 18 months away , he added.Until we understand the conditions that apply to the granting of this licence , it is impossible to state what role National Mutual Holdings or National Mutual Asia may play in the development of the business , Tomlinson said.As well , one Sydney insurance analyst said , there was a risk National Mutual had angered Chinese authorities by confirming they intended to grant the parent company a licence.They were with ( German insurer ) Allianz and they withdrew the licence and that 's a possibility ( with Axa-UAP ) as well , Macquarie Equities analyst Tony Jackson told Reuters.China told Allianz AG Holding in November it would be granted a licence , but the licence was thrown in doubt after European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan broke the news.Allianz has since been awarded the licence and will soon join only a handful of foreign life insurers operating in China.China 's insurance market , still in its infancy , was once almost monopolised by the state-owned People 's Insurance Group , but it has gradually opened up to local and foreign competition.National Mutual hopes its 69 percent-owned National Mutual Asia subsidiary will own the China business , in a joint venture with local partner China Everbright-IHD Pacific Ltd.But Axa-UAP shareholders are unlikely to hand ownership of such a potentially lucrative business to a subsidiary , Macquarie Equities ' Jackson said.It would be just a gift to minority interests , he said.Axa-UAP shareholders have only an effective 28 percent interest in National Mutual Asia , and would prefer the Hong Kong company managed the China business for a fee , he added.National Mutual shares hit a record high of A $ 2.10 after the announcement , but then fell back to end at A $ 1.98 , up four cents on Thursday 's close .
( A $ 1 = US $ 0.77 ) A new diamond mine looks likely to go ahead in north Australia after one of its backers on Thursday described a final feasiblity study on the project as encouraging.Base metals miner Aberfoyle Ltd , which has a minority interest alongside diamond group Ashton Mining Ltd in the Merlin project in the Northern Territory , said the study was now virtually complete.I think both companies have previously said they expected this to be developed into a project , albeit not at a large scale initially , Aberfoyle managing director Mike Eager told Reuters.I think it 's probably on track for that sort of conclusion , Eager said.The feasibility study , prepared by engineering consultants Bateman-Kinhill , has been discussed by the two owners and could be decided upon as early as this month.The report is due before Ashton 's board on June 19.Aberfoyle said both companies would make a final decision by the end of the September quarter.Ashton owns 77.5 percent of Merlin .
Aberfoyle has the rest.The feasibility study assumes a modest start to mining , with stage one annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes of ore. Ashton has already said the first stage would cost about A $ 20 million ( US $ 15.2 million ) .The joint venture partners plan to develop some open pits before evaluating Merlin 's underground mining resource and proceeding to a stage two expansion.We are still encouraged by what we have seen by the further work on site and the further ( work on the ) feasibility study and certainly there is no reason for discouragement , Eager said.The Merlin prospect contains about 12 kimberlite pipes -- rock formations associated with diamonds -- and only three of them have been bulk sampled for diamonds so far , he said.The sampling results suggest further upside to the project , Eager added.There 's evidence in at least some of the pipes that there 's an improvement in stone quality and perhaps in grade ... at the perimeters of the pipes , he said.Ashton reported late last year that diamonds recovered from Merlin were described as being 35 percent gem quality , with the remainder near gem quality.In its March quarter production report , Ashton said the results of recent cutting and polishing tests on 25 Merlin diamonds had been very encouraging.Ashton , which is owned 46.95 percent by Malaysia Mining Corp Bhd , owns 40.1 percent of the world 's biggest diamond mine , the Argyle mine in northwest Australia .
( A $ 1 = US $ 0.76 ) Australian transport and health care group Mayne Nickeless Ltd said on Thursday it aimed to sell its stake in the nation 's second telecommunications carrier by July , saying it needed to get its hands on that bag of gold.Bob Dalziel , managing director of Mayne Nickless , which has a 25 percent stake in Optus Communications Pty Ltd , estimated to be worth about A $ 1 billion , made the remark after Mayne reported what it characterised as a reasonable half-year net profit .
Net earnings after abnormal items fell 13.8 percent to A $ 43.14 million for the six months to end December , but managing director Bob Dalziel said the result hid a rise in underlying profitability and he forecast a strong full-year result.We are seeing ourselves well placed now to have a very strong year result , he told a news conference.But the result and bullish outlook were overshadowed by the financing of Mayne 's Optus investment , which cost nearly A $ 20 million in interest payments over the half year and has , in the words of one analyst , become a noose around the company 's neck .
Dalziel said he had assured ratings agencies Standard and Poor 's and Moody 's Investors Service that Mayne aimed to sell its stake by July and virtually ruled out a float of Optus by then.Until Optus was dragged late last year into a legal battle for control of its pay-television associate , Optus Vision , Mayne planned to dispose of the stake via a market float of Optus.I do n't think the float is relaistic in the short term unless we want to do it while litigation is occurring ... because our goal is to exit our Optus investment by June , July , Dalziel said .
The Australian stock exchange on Tuesday used the China visit of Prime Minister John Howard to make a high profile sales pitch for Chinese companies to list shares on Australia 's stock market.The Australian prime minister , before meeting China 's President Jiang Zemin , found time to open a seminar for China 's market regulators and top-level managers of its state-run companies designed to show them why they should look to Australia to raise capital.Senior officials from the Australian Stock Exchange as well as brokerages and legal firms delivered the message that Australia had much to offer.Cross-border equities trading now amounts to around $ 4 trillion a year , which no stock market can afford to ignore , Australian Stock Exchange chairman Maurice Newman told the seminar.I hope that one day we may be able to welcome you to our market.Most Chinese companies that have listed their shares abroad have chosen Hong Kong where investors have been snapping up China-related stocks.One recent listing of a China-linked company was nearly 900 times oversubscribed , and Australia may find it difficult to generate that kind of interest.Newman later told reporters that 19 of 31 Asian-owned companies on the Australian exchange already had a China connection .
These companies have often used a corporation not based in China to make the listing , in effect sidestepping regulatory curbs in their home country.Trading in some of those issues has not been active.The liquidity of those companies is mixed , said Newman .
As a group we would prefer that it were greater.Australia may soon get its first direct Chinese listing.Taihang Cement , a cement producer based in the northern province of Hebei , has already gained approval from Chinese regulatory authorities for a foreign listing.Company officials told reporters they hoped to list their shares in Australia by the year-end.We chose Australia because we have a foundation there , said Zhang Zhixian , Taihang 's manager of investment development , noting that the company exports cement to Australia.Company officials said the exact size of the offer had not been set but would range between 100 and 200 million yuan ( $ 12-24 million ) .Other participants at the seminar said Australia might target its efforts at sectors where Australia is already strong , such as in natural resources.Australia would have a natural advantage in infrastructure and resource-based companies , said Tony Greenwood , of law firm Blake Dawson Waldron , noting the heavy weighting of such stocks in Australia.One area of concern for Chinese companies will be financial transparency , which has posed a problem for them in the past.Some Chinese companies have had trouble complying with domestic regulations and others have come under criticism in Hong Kong for lack of transparency.Our concern must also be the integrity of our market , said Newman.It is important that companies are familiar with our listing requirements and they observe them faithfully .
China 's President Jiang Zemin used his eulogy for Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday to hail the late leader 's guidance in the recovery of Hong Kong and pledge peaceful reunification with Taiwan.Jiang told 10,000 Communist Party luminaries and other guests at the funeral rites for the late leader that Deng 's great creation was the one country , two systems formula of allowing capitalist and socialist systems to coexist side by side in one country.The complete reunification of our motherland is the common aspiration of the entire Chinese nation , said Jiang , Deng 's hand-picked successor , in a speech delivered at Beijing 's Great Hall of the People and televised around the country.Using the formula of 'one country , two systems ' to realise peaceful reunification is Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's great creation , he said.Deng guided the negotiations with Britain that eventually led to a 1984 accord under which the colony is to be returned to Chinese rule at midnight next June 30.Under that agreement , Beijing pledges to allow the colony to retain its capitalist system and a high degree of autonomy for 50 years.The nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau reverts to China in 1999 , leaving Nationalist Chinese-ruled Taiwan as the last territory Beijing must recover to achieve its dream of reunification.Deng died last Wednesday before seeing the recovery of any of these territories but Jiang said the Communist Party should carry out the late leader 's mission.We must act in accordance with the teachings of Comrade Deng Xiaoping , striving to attain the objective of the motherland 's reunification , Jiang said , speaking in front of a huge portrait of Deng draped in black ribbons and surrounded by bouquets of flowers.In accordance with the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese agreements , Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the motherland soon and Macao will return to the embrace of the motherland in 1999 , he said.The Taiwan question will be settled eventually and the complete reunification of the motherland will certainly be achieved , he said confidently.Among the invited guests in the cavernous auditorium were supporters of Beijing from Hong Kong and Macau , most of them prominent businessmen , as well as Tung Chee-hwa who has been chosen to take over as Hong Kong 's chief executive on July 1.Despite its pledge of autonomy for Hong Kong , Beijing has already decided to scrap some civil liberties and replace the territory 's elected legislature with an appointed one after the transfer of power.That has raised concerns in Hong Kong as well as the United States and Britain.Taiwan , which has been separated from China since the end of a civil war in 1949 , says it too wants to reunify with the mainland but under very different terms than those offered by Beijing .
China 's state-run steel companies must trim their bloated payrolls but they are nimble enough to survive in the fiercely competitive marketplace , top officials said on Monday.They also pledged that big steelmakers now preparing to float their shares -- like Anshan Steel and Chongqing Iron and Steel -- would not disappoint shareholders.We have confidence in the state enterprises in our industry , said Liu Qi , minister of Metallurgial Industry .
They can adapt to market conditions.Liu and other senior ministry officials told reporters that many companies in the sector had already begun trimming staff and the trend would continue in the years ahead.We have made a good start to restructuring , he said , adding that reforms would continue.Many of China 's big state industries are grossly overstaffed and unable to compete with more efficient foreign competitors.Senior ministry officials said they wanted to see only about 800,000 workers producing steel by the turn of the century .
The industry employs 4.5 million people now , but that includes many workers not directly engaged in production as well as those at associated companies.Liu said that Anshan Steel , one of three companies cleared late last year to list its shares abroad , had 190,000 employees but only 70,000 were producing steel.The others were at affiliated companies that were operating independently , he said.Liu cautioned , however , that many of them would not be out on the street as companies would try to find some form of work for them.Restructuring does not mean large numbers of people thrown out of work , he said.Liu said that while steelmakers tried to streamline their operations they were also incorporating new technology to help cut production costs.Other officials defended the track record of steel companies that have already offered shares , such as Hong Kong-listed Maanshan Iron and Steel , which has struggled with profits.Maanshan is a good company with excellent products and equipment , said vice minister Wang Wanbin.Maanshan has had problems but it will achieve better results in future , he said , adding that other steelmakers would also perform well in future.Other officials said that China 's had 107 large and medium-sized steel making companies and that 70 percent of them made were profitable last year.They earned a net 5.1 billion yuan last year with gross profits of 7.4 billion yuan , partly offset by losses of 2.3 billion from those operating in the red.They added that nearly half of the smaller companies were losing money though and that economies of scale had to be raised.Panzhihua , a big steelmaker in Sichuan , is also planning to list shares abroad , while Benxi Steel and Hubei Daye Specialty Steel are among those planning offers for foreigners on the domestic B share market .
China has scored new successes in its fight against inflation and economists said on Friday that price rises this year could be well below target.Some economists say inflation had been squeezed out of the economy with only a modest impact on growth as economic expansion continued at a fairly rapid pace.This is better than expected , said Chen Dezun , head of the price research institute of the State Planning Commission.We could see inflation of between three and four percent this year , he told Reuters.The benchmark retail price index rose a meagre 1.7 percent in March and 2.6 percent for the first quarter of the year , the State Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.China forecast a 6.0 percent rise in retail prices this year after a 6.1 percent increase last year .
That was already well below the 14.8 percent recorded in 1995 and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.China 's economic growth is expected to top 10 percent this year after a solid 9.7 percent in 1996.The inflation figure for the first quarter was also below an estimate by Premier Li Peng this week that retail price inflation would average 3.0 percent in the January-March period.Chen said good weather had been a factor , ensuring steady supplies of agricultural goods and keeping prices down.What China officially refers to as appropriately tight monetary policies had also been a crucial factor , he said.The appropriately tight monetary policies are now showing results , he said.China has kept controls on fixed asset investment , keeping government spending down , and that has kept a cap on the demand for goods such as construction materials.After adjusting for inflation , the real rise in fixed asset investment last year was a fairly modest 11.5 percent.The key has been control over fixed asset investment , said Zhong Jiyun , an economist at the state think tank , the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Some economists have argued that with the battle against inflation proceeding favourably , China can now afford to ease its monetary policies.Many inefficient state-run enterprises are swimming in red ink and saddled with debt they can not repay.Managers of these companies and their local government officials have called for easier credit to help to reduce their heavy financial burden.But Zhong is among the economists who believe that China is not yet able to declare the war on inflation over.I believe we still need to keep the controls on , he said .
The CITIC Industrial Bank , financial arm of China 's CITIC conglomerate , said on Monday it expected solid profit growth this year despite mounting competition and a key goal of limiting risk.Stable development is more important than a big profit rise , said Zhang Jian , deputy general manager and economist.The bank has set a target of pre-tax profits of at least 1.8 billion yuan ( $ 217 million ) this year compared with 1.58 billion in 1996 and 1.01 billion in 1995.The bank is a major profit contributor to the China International Trust and Development Corp , or CITIC , which has interests from telecommunications to real estate and manufacturing .
The CITIC group announced overall earnings of 2.478 billion yuan last year.China 's economic tsar Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has pushed for more discipline in the financial sector , particularly following the failure in January of the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp. That sent shock waves through the financial community , and Zhu has warned that state banks overall need to cut bad debt by two percent annually over the next five years.CITIC Industrial Bank has been one of the stronger players in the financial sector , however.Unlike the main state-run commercial banks , it does not have to make loans to aid government policy , regardless of whether the borrower can repay.But Zhang said top management at the bank was focusing on tightening risk controls.Enhancing ( asset ) quality and the assessment of risk were two key goals for the bank this year , he said in an interview.CITIC 's customers for the most part were profitable state industrial companies and government corporations engaged in foreign trade .
Most of the bank 's loans were short term , usually for less than 180 days , Zhang said.That has made it difficult for the bank to move into new areas of business such as home mortgages or car financing , two areas where China is likely to see substantial growth in the years ahead.CITIC is also facing an increasingly crowded banking sector as new domestic banks emerge and more foreign banks enter the local market.Zhang said CITIC had begun private banking operations at its branch in the southern city of Guangzhou to try to expand business.It is experimenting with ways to boost service to its big corporate clients , such as extending banking hours and installing computers at customer offices and linking them to its own network to make banking easier.CITIC had total assets of 108 billion yuan at the end of last year compared with 86 billion at the end of 1995.Deposits reached 87 billion yuan last year , up from 67 billion in 1995 , despite two reductions in domestic interest rates by the central bank last year.Zhang said he believed further cuts in interest rates would make it difficult for the nation 's banks to attract deposits.I do n't think there can be another interest rate cut this year , he said .

( $ 1 = 8.3 yuan ) China will aim to show U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that improving Sino-American ties will not be harmed by the death of Deng Xiaoping , analysts said on Sunday.They also said Albright , who arrives in China on Monday for a brief stopover on her nine-nation tour , would likely focus on maintaining momentum in the once-stalled ties , looking ahead to exchanges of senior level visits.China will want to make the point that it is stable after Deng 's death , said Niu Jun , a specialist in U.S. policy issues at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , a government think-tank.It will want to demonstrate that there is no change in Sino-U.S. relations , he said.Deng , architect of sweeping economic reforms that have embraced capitalist-style economic policies , died on Wednesday aged 92.Albright will arrive in Beijing during a six-day mourning period for the nation 's paramount leader and one day before the funeral .
Chinese leaders have been eager to show that affairs of state will continue as usual.Deng 's hand-picked successor , President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin , has vowed to push ahead with Deng 's programme and even outdo him.Jiang has been in power since he was propelled to the top party post in 1989 , when Deng abandoned his old ally Zhao Ziyang in a dispute over the use of force against students pushing for But Jiang now must fend off other contenders for power without the helping hand of his benefactor.Albright , on her first trip overseas since becoming America 's top diplomat last month , will meet Jiang as well as Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.Western analysts said Albright would not shrink from contentious issues like China 's human rights record , but would chart a steady course in the vital Sino-U.S. relationship during President Bill Clinton 's second term.The U.S. wants to ensure that its China relations are no longer scraping along the bottom , said a Western diplomat.U.S.-China ties had stumbled badly over a range of issues including Taiwan , trade , arms proliferation and human rights.A long-delayed visit to Beijing in November by Albright 's predecessor Warren Christopher paved the way for the renewed push to put differences aside.That new approach was endorsed at a meeting between Jiang and Clinton at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila later that month.U.S .
Vice President Al Gore will travel to China next month and Clinton and Jiang are expected to exchange visits over the next year.Albright may be compelled to touch on human rights during her talks with Chinese officials as the United States plans to co-sponsor a resolution critical of China at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.Washington may also be looking to show at least some measure of toughness towards Beijing to allay domestic concerns following allegations of Chinese contributions to Clinton 's re-election campaign.But Albright and other U.S. officials have said no one issue should dominate the relationship.Analysts said that probably means that as for the more difficult problems , the two sides will have to agree to disagree .
China published on Saturday a list of anti-dumping rules to protect local companies from unfair foreign competition.Chinese economists said the rules would help domestic companies , many of them targets of similar dumping claims overseas , protect their share of the domestic market.They also said the move appeared to be aimed at giving a legal framework to protection from unfair competition and clarifying procedures for its use.Many Chinese companies are unable to compete in the face of unfair trade practices , economist Cheng Xiusheng of the State Council ( cabinet ) development research centre told Reuters.Many other countries have imposed anti-dumping duties against Chinese products and China needs a system to regulate its own market and protect its companies , he said.The rules , published in the official People 's Daily , give the government the right to determine whether imported goods are aided by official subsidies and impose anti-dumping duties on foreign goods .
Cash guarantees can be demanded to ensure payment.Prices in the exporting country or third countries will be used to determine a fair price for goods in dispute and set a countervailing duty.The rules also provide guidelines for domestic companies to file complaints about unfair competition and set a maximum length of 12 months for an investigation .
Special cases are allowed to take 18 months.The rules also empower the state to take retaliatory measures against countries that impose discriminatory countervailing duties against Chinese goods.Beijing 's official media have said the dumping of foreign goods on the domestic market had cost China some 10 billion yuan ( $ 1.2 billion ) a year and had caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.Many domestic manufacturers were pressuring the government to take steps to offset these policies , newspapers have said.Other economists said China was trying to codify the protection of its industries and bring its trade policies more in line with international practice.They added that as China sought to join the World Trade Organisation it was being forced to make its polices more transparent .
A Chinese ideologue known for his strictly orthodox Marxist views denied on Tuesday that he was the author of two essays critical of China 's reforms.Deng Liqun , 81 , a former Communist Party propaganda chief and secretary to Chairman Mao Zedong , said the author of two articles that have become known as The 10,000 Word Essay was Li Yanming.I did n't write the essay , it was Li Yanming , Deng told reporters .
He did not further identify Li Yanming and gave no Asked whether he supported Li 's views in The 10,000 Word Essay that has sparked widespread behind-the-scenes debate , he smiled and shrugged and said : He wrote what was on his mind.Deng was attending an economic summit in Beijing that was assessing the business climate in China , with a heavy emphasis on the successes of the reform programme launched in 1979 by Deng Xiaoping to eliminate stultifying Stalinist-style planning in favour of market forces.Asked if he agreed with issues under debate at the conference , Deng adopted the officially-sanctioned public party line : Of course .
China is a very big country , it has a lot of potential but it also has a lot of problems to be solved.Several of the speakers at the conference called for tougher efforts to reform China 's ailing state-owned enterprises , which The 10,000 Word Essay warns are suffering at the expense of private enterprise.China 's propaganda tsars recently suspended a magazine and banned articles by a leading bankruptcy expert after a lengthy behind-doors debate on the essay erupted into the public eye.The ban prompted an open letter by a writer in Beijing questioning whether China 's propaganda officials were opposed to economic reform and whether they backed the leadership of state president and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.The Press and Publications Administration , under the party 's powerful Propaganda Department , suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly , based in southwestern Guizhou province , in August , said sources familiar with the magazine.The suspension followed the magazine 's publication of an article critical of the privately circulated 10,000-word essay , which also urges a return to the class struggle espoused by Mao.Western diplomats and Chinese analysts have described a literary and cultural freeze in recent months amid a crackdown by propaganda tsars on publications and authors that dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare.The president of the outspoken Beijing Youth Daily is to be replaced soon by a more conservative editor.The clampdown has been fuelled by a call for spiritual civilisation -- a communist watchword for orthodox Marxist values -- as the theme for a party plenum scheduled for later this month , the analysts said.Party chief Jiang is said to have distanced himself from the essay at the annual session of the National People 's Congress , or parliament , last March , when he reportedly said : Some people say I support the 10,000-word essay , is n't that underestimating me too much ?
Premier Li Peng said on Friday China wanted a swift end to a crisis surrounding a senior North Korean defector sheltering in South Korea 's mission in Beijing.Li gave little hint as to how the month-long standoff would end , although he said stability on the tense Korean peninsula was a key consideration.I can tell you conditions are nearly ripe for solving this problem , Li told reporters when asked about progress in negotiations on the fate of Hwang Jang-yop , who has sought refuge in Seoul 's Beijing consulate.China wanted to appropriately solve this problem at an early date , he told a news conference at Beijing 's cavernous Great Hall of the People.On this question , China will exercise caution and we will handle the issue by proceeding from the maintenance of peace on the Korean peninsula , Li said.Of course , we will consider the positions of all sides , he said.Hwang , a senior ideological theoretician and top aide to supreme leader Kim Jong-il , has been stranded in the consular compound since February 12 while China and North and South Korea negotiate his fate.He is the most senior official to defect from the isolated Stalinist state.He has said he wants to be allowed to go to South Korea and foreign diplomats have said that he would likely be allowed to leave for a third country first and then travel to Seoul.The defection on Chinese territory has deeply embarrassed Beijing , forcing it to chose between its old communist ally of North Korea and its new capitalist friend in the South.China and North Korea fought side by side in the 1950-53 Korean War but Beijing has drawn closer to South Korea as it pushes ahead with rapid development under market-style economic reforms.Li repeated Beijing 's position that it had jurisdiction since Hwang asked for asylum while he was in Beijing.He said China would follow international practice in solving the dispute but he made the somewhat surprising remark that there was no automatic right to asylum as far as Beijing was concerned.China does not recognise the right of diplomatic asylum by foreign embassies or consulates in its territory , he said.Beijing has , however , allowed asylum seekers to leave foreign embassies on its soil in the past.Dissident Fang Lizhi sought shelter in the U.S. embassy in Beijing shortly after the army crackdown on dissent in June 1989 .
He was eventually allowed to leave for the United States .
China is expected to unveil a cautious budget this weekend , avoiding bold but risky moves in 1997 , the crucial year of the recovery of Hong Kong and a major meeting of the Communist Party elite , economists said on Friday.The 1997 budget would again show a hefty deficit although it could be smaller than the 61.442 billion yuan ( $ 7.4 billion ) estimate for 1996 , they said.This should be a year for a steady-as-she-goes budget , said a foreign diplomat who follows economic issues.Finance Minister Liu Zhongli is expected to announce the budget to the National People 's Congress , or parliament , on Sunday or Monday.The recovery of the British colony of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 and the scheduling of the Communist Party congress for later in the year will most likely ensure cautious fiscal policies , economists said.Beijing wants to see the Hong Kong handover proceed smoothly and its leaders have little inclination to take risks ahead of the congress which will set policies and decide who gets the top jobs for the next five years .
Beijing 's leaders also have an added reason for caution as they can no longer rely on the steadying hand of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping , who died this month.I am not looking for anything startling in the budget , said another foreign diplomat.Even if the deficit is not reduced this year , it will still be manageable .
Last year 's deficit was only 0.99 percent of estimated 1996 gross domestic product.Economists said they expected to see higher tax revenues this year as China 's economy grows at a steady pace and tax collection improves.China has already forecast economic growth of 10.5 percent for the year , up from 9.7 percent recorded in 1996 .
Premier Li Peng on Saturday is to set a yet more cautious goal of 8.0 percent growth.State revenues expanded 18.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year , and economists said more efficient tax collection and better management of state finances were key factors.Inflation will also be relatively modest this year , limiting upward pressure on government spending .
Retail price inflation is forecast at less than the 6.1 percent of 1996.Despite lower interest rates , Beijing will need to meet increased payments of interest and principal on past debts , said economist Li Yang , of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.This will mean more bonds will be issued this year , he said.Economists said , however , this was not a major concern as it was largely in line with China 's efforts to issue more tradeable debt to create an active secondary market and strengthen its financial sector.But a cautious budget will mean China can not afford to make deep cuts in subsidies to ailing state industry in 1997.Many overstaffed state companies badly need to shed workers from their payrolls but Beijing 's leaders are fearful this could lead to social unrest.Economists will also be watching the military budget closely , where further increases in spending are expected.Deng 's chosen successor , President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin , needs the support of the army to retain his grip on power.In his eulogy for Deng , Jiang referred to the army as the pillar of the state.China has said it wants to reduce the size of its three-million-strong army but it is likely to more than offset savings with stepped up spending on advanced weaponry , analysts said .
For the second time in a row , the United Auto Workers union has chosen Ford Motor Co. to lead the union 's labor contract negotiations with the Big Three U.S. automakers , officials said late on Tuesday.UAW vice president Ernest Lofton said union leaders notified Ford executives of the decision Tuesday , but added that the union was not viewing the company as a traditional strike target in the talks.They are the lead company in regards to resolving our 1996 negotiations , Lofton said Tuesday night in a brief interview on WDIV-TV.The selection will allow the No .
2 U.S. automaker to negotiate an agreement that will serve as a pattern for rivals General Motors Corp and Chrysler Corp to follow.Contracts covering nearly 400,000 U.S. hourly workers at all three companies expire September 14 .
Despite the conciliatory talk , Ford as the target company faces the threat of a national strike if it fails to reach an agreement before the expiration.Ford spokesman Jon Harmon would only read the following statement Tuesday : We 're hard at work negotiating with the UAW at the subcommittee level as well as at the main table , and we are encouraged by the tone of the negotiations , he said.Our team is working under the assumption that we will be closely involved in whatever transpires over the next two weeks .
And that 's been our preference all along.The decision marks the second time in a row that the union has chosen Ford to lead its Big Three U.S. negotiations .
Ford , which employs about 104,000 UAW members , negotiated the current pact in 1993 and is widely viewed to have the best union relations among the three automakers.The UAW 's top priorities in the 1996 negotiations are improved job security for its workers and restrictions on the automakers ' ability to shift work to lower-cost outside suppliers .
Analysts say Ford has shown willingness to cooperate with the union on both fronts.General Motors has been shrinking its workforce in an effort to become cost-competitive , presenting negotiators with more difficult problems to overcome .
The UAW typically has first gone to the company where it believes it could reach the most favorable contract with the least amount of difficulty.Chrysler , which UAW officials say was less willing to meet their demands , has instead been chosen as the Canadian Auto Workers union 's negotiating target .
The CAW 's Big Three labor contract , covering about 53,000 workers , has been extended until September 17 .
General Motors Corp. said Friday it will consolidate all of its commercial truck production in Flint , Mich. , but will discontinue some engineering work there and in Lansing , Mich.The moves ensure a solid future for the automaker 's truck plant in Flint , which will expand its work force by up to 3,000 jobs by the year 2001 , according to United Auto Workers officials .
It now employs about 2,000 workers.But the gain for Flint , a beleagured GM factory town hit hard by job losses in recent years , will be a blow to Detroit 's inner city .
GM said it will close a 78-year-old truck and bus chassis plant in Detroit that employs 494 people and move the production to Flint in the year 2000.About 90 engineers at the six-story plant will be transferred immediately to GM facilities in Pontiac , Mich.GM also will shift production of medium-duty commercial trucks from Janesville , Wis. , to Flint , in 2001 .
The Janesville truck line employs about 1,000 people , but GM officials say many of those workers should be absorbed by Janesville 's full-size sport utility vehicle assembly line.GM said the Janesville plant will build the next-generation Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon vehicles , but it did not disclose any plans to expand Janesville 's capacity to build the trucks.GM will begin building the popular sport utility vehicles at a second plant , in Arlington , Texas , later this year.The auto giant said it will invest about $ 500 million in the Flint truck plant to prepare it for the medium-duty truck production and to expand its capacity to build the next generation of GM 's full-size C/K pickup trucks.The plant currently builds larger commercial versions of C/K pickups , but before Friday 's announcement , GM had not assigned it a future product , leaving its fate clouded.The investments will pay for two new body shops , a second paint shop and additional chassis , trim and general assembly lines at the facility .
Expanded production at the plant will increase GM 's truck production capacity by about 5 percent , allowing it to grab a bigger share of the expanding truck market.However , long before Flint sees new jobs at the truck plant , it will have to give up the jobs of about 950 engine and transmission engineers , which GM will transfer to other facilities in Warren and Milford , Mich. , in 1998.GM also is discontinuing other powertrain engineering work in Lansing that employs about 600 people .
That work also will be transferred to Warren and Milford.Another 550 engineers have already been transferred to those locations from elsewhere in the Detroit area , bringing the total affected by the powertrain moves to 2,100.The consolidation moves are aimed at reducing GM 's production and operating costs , but GM officials did not specify the expected savings.The optimization of our facilities will allow us to reduce our structural costs , make better use of our resources and improve our productivity , said Ned McClurg , general manager of the GM Powertrain Group.Few of the production workers displaced by the moves will be left without a paycheck .
Under GM 's UAW contract , it must continue to pay workers who are idled by such actions.A day after it announced the long-awaited , $ 9.5 billion sale of its Hughes Aircraft defense operations to Raytheon Co. , GM 's stock had slipped 25 cents to $ 60.125 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Pulling back from the battered car rental business , Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it agreed to sell its interests in Budget Rent a Car Corp. to a Florida firm in a deal valued at about $ 350 million.Team Rental Group Inc. , the Daytona Beach-based buyer , already owns and operates 13 Budget franchises with 155 locations .
It also leases commuter vans in 22 states and sells used vehicles.In light of investor interest in the entire rental car industry , we concluded that it is now in the best interests of Budget and Ford if Team Rental , Budget 's largest franchisee , were to acquire Budget .
It 's a good fit , Ford Vice Chairman Ed Hagenlocker said in a statement.Although the sale of Ford 's preferred stock in Budget is not expected to close until March , the automaker said it will book an unspecified gain on the deal in its fourth quarter 1996 earnings.The gain will partially reverse a $ 437 million after-tax write-off Ford took on its investment and on loans to Budget in the second quarter.The deal also will add cash to Ford 's coffers , bringing it closer to a future stock repurchase program.Ford spokesman Christian Vinyard said top Ford executives told analysts Friday that the company will consider such repurchases after it cuts automotive costs by $ 1 billion and boosts cash reserves above their current level of $ 7 billion.We said it 's on the menu , but way down the line , Vinyard said of a stock buyback program .
Do n't be looking for it in the March or April timeframe.Tuesday 's deal marked a major shift by Ford to reduce its rental car holdings and reverses a plan announced by the automaker last year to acquire full ownership of Budget.Ford also has said it may sell a partial stake in its Hertz Corp. subsidiary , among other strategic options it examining.Archrival General Motors Corp. has already divested its holdings in National Car Rental System Inc. and Avis Inc. , while Chrysler Corp. 's Dollar and Thrifty units remain on the sale block.Analysts said a new breed of bottom line-oriented investors was now taking a dominant role in car rental industry.That industry has gotten a little fat , said George Magliano , an automotive consultant with WEFA Group in New York .
They sit with a lot of cars that go unrented .
And when that happens , the bottom line is destroyed , said GeorgeLisle , Ill.-based Budget , together with its independent licensees , ranks as the world 's fourth-largest rental car business , Ford said.Ford does not own Budget outright , but controls it through a stock purchase option.We have the right to direct the sale of the common shares and that 's what we have done , Vinyard said.A Team Rental spokesman said the company will pay $ 275 million in cash and issue non-voting preferred securities convertible into 4.5 million shares of Team common stock with a minimum value at closing of $ 75 million.The board of Team Rental already has approved the deal , spokesman Steve Polito said.Ford said it would continue to be a major supplier of cars and trucks to Budget 's fleet .
The transaction also includes a new vehicle supply arrangement between Ford and Budget.Automakers began acquiring rental car companies in the mid-1980s with the idea that they could absorb unsold auto inventory into their fleets and keep Detroit 's factories running.That strategy worked for a few years , but then backfired when sales of barely used rental vehicles began eating into new car sales.The Budget deal is the second major car rental sale in just over a week .
On Jan. 6 , investor H. Wayne Huizenga 's Republic Industries Inc. bought National from a private investor group for $ 600 million .
Republic bought Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc. late last year.Ford 's stock closed up 50 cents at $ 33.75 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The Canadian Auto Workers union 's choice of Chrysler Corp as its strike target on Wednesday sets up a battle between General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co to take the lead in bargaining with the larger United Auto Workers.Currently , Ford appears to gaining an edge , analysts say.Detroit 's No .
2 automaker , viewed as least likely to be named the UAW 's target a few weeks ago , has recenly made offers that show a willingness to work with the union on the thorny issue of outsourcing , analysts say .
Ford is working hard to give the UAW a framework agreement , said Sean McAlinden , a labor analyst with the University of Michigan 's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation.Now that the Canadian union has chosen Chrysler , it appears highly unlikely that UAW President Stephen Yokich will choose Chrysler as the U.S. target .
Traditionally , the two unions have chosen different targets and threaten each with a national strike to push negotiations along.Pacts covering about 400,000 Big Three hourly workers in the United States and 53,000 in Canada expire on September 14 .
McAlinden said Ford has offered the UAW some opportunities to move some parts manufacturing now done by outside suppliers back into Ford plants .
That 's the opposite of the task that GM is trying accomplish -- shifting more of its parts work to outside suppliers to bring down its burdensome cost structure.In addition , Ford earlier this year encouraged one of its suppliers , Johnson Controls Inc to allow some of its plants to be organized by the UAW -- a move that could help the union reverse declining membership rolls .
If Ford is chosen to negotiate the pattern agreement for the Big Three automakers in the United States , it could craft an agreement that would help meet its own needs , but that would hold back GM 's cost-cutting progress.Ford may try to throw them a chicken bone to choke on , McAlinden said.Yokich last week opted to delay the union 's choice of a target and analysts said he could let GM and Ford compete for a while longer to be named the target .
In 1984 , the union named the two automakers as dual targets and later negotiated the patern agreement with GM .
A dual target is certainly possible , but it 's hard to focus on two places at once , said Harley Shaiken , a professor of labor relations at the University of California-Berkeley .
The UAW may just let it roll a bit longer and select the best offer sometime later.Shaiken believes the Canadian Auto Workers ' choice was probably dictated by the UAW 's decision to eliminate Chrysler from consideration .
CAW President Buzz Hargrove 's decision to focus on Chrysler was a reluctant choice since he had spent much of the summer talking tough to GM.Some UAW leaders at individual Chrysler plants said they supported Yokich 's apparent decision to focus on Ford or GM.I have full confidence that the UAW leadership is making the right decision , said Gary Kimbel , vice president of UAW Local 140 at Chrysler 's Warren , Mich. , truck plant .
U.S. sales of General Motors Corp. cars and trucks in November dropped nearly 12 percent from a year ago because of strikes in the United States and Canada and major model changeovers , the automaker said Tuesday.The world 's largest automaker said its total U.S. vehicle sales for the month fell to 336,815 from 382,372 a year earlier.GM car sales plunged 22.5 percent to 179,150 , while total truck sales , despite strike-related production losses , rose 4.2 percent to 157,665.GM said walkouts by the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers unions in October and early November reduced the availability of its full size pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles , as well as its high-volume Chevrolet Lumina , Monte Carlo , Cavalier and Cadillac DeVille car lines.In addition , sales of several key high-volume models that GM is replacing were down significantly from year ago levels due to model changeovers.We expect GM 's car maket share to struggle along for about six months , said Lincoln Merrihew , auto analyst with DRI/McGraw-Hill in Cambridge , Mass .
They 're running out of old product.Production of the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars was recently ended , and sales were down 89 percent to 1,494 units .
GM dealers have not yet begun selling the cars ' replacement , the Chevrolet Malibu.Chevrolet , GM 's largest division , had November sales of 169,110 , a drop of more than 13 percent from 194,973.Car sales for other GM divisions fell in November , with Pontiac off 7.4 percent , Oldsmobile off 27.6 percent , Buick off 14.5 percent , Cadillac off 11.1 percent and Saturn off 18.3 percent.The automaker also blamed the drop partly on the fact that it has been less aggressive than Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. with incentives on 1997 models.Merrihew said about 15 percent of all 1997 model cars and trucks currently offered rebates of $ 1,000 or more.For the first 11 months of 1996 , GM dealers have sold 4,447,147 total vehicles , down 1.7 percent from the same period of 1995.GM 's numbers , which came one day after Chrysler reported a 1 percent increase in November sales , confirmed analyst projections that November will be a weak month for Detroit 's Big Three automakers.That was not the case with three Japanese automakers , Toyota Motor Corp. , Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp..Spurred by strong sales of its new Camry sedan , Toyota reported total November sales of 99,241 , a 19.6 percent increase.Consumer confidence and spending have proven surprisingly resilient in the fourth quarter , driving industry sales far beyond expectations , Yale Gieszl , executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. , said in a statement.Toyota said it sold 31,644 Camrys last month , a 31 percent increase and its best-ever November performance .
Total sport utility sales were 16,268 , more than double a year ago.Toyota said its new 4Runner had sales of 9,040 , a record for November and an increase of 35.3 percent .
The RAV4 mini sport utility continued to exceed sales expectations and had November sales of 5,321.Honda sales rose nearly 16 percent to 70,534 , riding the strength of the company 's Accord , which had a 41 percent jump in sales to 32,719.While total car sales for Honda rose 16.8 percent to 68,136 , Honda light truck sales fell 6 percent to 2,398.Mitsubishi sales for the month rose 13.6 percent to 14,225 units , with a 51.4 percent increase in domestic car sales offsetting declines in import car and truck sales.Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. said its U.S. November sales fell 2.5 percent to 51,325 cars , due to a 12.4 percent drop in domestic car sales.Ford is expected to report its sales results on Wednesday .
Ford Motor Co. , following several competitors in offering certified used cars , said Monday its Ford and Lincoln brands are starting used vehicle warranty programmes that eventually will be available nationwide.Under the programmes , Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealers will put cars and trucks through special inspection and reconditioning processes and offer factory-backed warranties and three-day , money-back guarantees.This is not just an individual , dealer programme , said Ford division spokesman Dan Bedore .
It 's backed by the Ford Motor Company.The Ford Division programme will be launched in the spring following a regional rollout in the southeastern United States in mid-November , while the Lincoln programme will be introduced in major markets Dec. 9.A third programme covering Ford 's Mercury brand cars and trucks will begin next summer , a Ford spokesman said.The programmes are among several now offered by major automakers , including General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. , in an effort to keep their dealers competitive in the growing market for used cars and trucks.Ample supplies of used vehicles that have come off of two-year leases have given rise to several new used-car superstore chains , such as Circuit City Stores Inc. 's successful CarMax unit , and a new chain called AutoNation USA , started by Blockbuster Entertainment founder H. Wayne Huizenga.Ford estimated the annual pre-owned car and truck market at 43 million units and $ 370 billion in revenues .
Automakers are expected to sell about 15.5 million new cars and trucks in the United States this year.To qualify for the Ford Quality Certified programme , Ford brand cars and trucks must be under four years old and have been driven less than 50,000 miles .
Those vehicles must pass a 100-point inspection , and following reconditioning , will receive a one-year , 12,000-mile warranty , 24-hour assistance and a three-day , 300-mile money-back guarantee.To qualify for the Lincoln Assured prgram , Lincoln luxury cars must be one-owner 1994 models or later with less than 36,000 miles and have suffered no major damage.They will undergo a 150-point inspection and will be backed by a two-year , 24,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty , Lincoln-Mercury said , adding that brake pads will be replaced on all Lincoln cars with more than 25,000 miles .
Chrysler Corp. 's redesigned 1997 Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle will carry a base price $ 555 to $ 1,344 higher than the 1996 model , the automaker said Wednesday.Chrysler , implementing the first major update of the Cherokee since it was introduced by American Motors Corp. in the fall of 1983 , said the base SE , two-door , two-wheel-drive 1997 model will start at $ 15,825 , an increase of $ 555 from the 1996 model.The four-door , four-wheel-drive Cherokee Sport model -- the most popular version of the vehicle -- will sell for $ 20,985 , an increase of $ 815 from the 1996 model .
The most expensive Cherokee , the four-door , four-wheel-drive Country model , will start at $ 23,945 , an increase of $ 1,344 over the 1996 model.The Sport and Country models offer a standard six-cylinder engine , while the SE model offers a standard four-cylinder engine .
All of the prices include a $ 525 destination charge.For 1997 , the vehicle gets a new instrument panel with dual air bags , updated sheet metal and a redesigned grille.But the Cherokee retains much the same squared-off look it had when it became the industry 's first compact , four-door sport utility vehicle as a 1984 model.Chrysler said it has the capacity to build about 150,000 Cherokees annually at its Toledo , Ohio , assembly plant .
Through the first 10 months of 1996 , Jeep dealers sold 131,995 Cherokees , which represents a 44 percent increase over the 91,246 they sold in the same period of 1995.The automaker also said it kept the price of its 1997 Dodge Viper GTS coupe unchanged at $ 66,700 , but two features that were standard the 1996 model -- metallic blue paint with white racing stripes and polished aluminum wheels -- are now options with a combined cost of $ 1,500 .
The 1997 Viper GTS coupe comes with standard monochromatic red paint.Separately , Chrysler increased cash incentives on two 1996-model versions of its full-size vans , effective immediately through April 7 , 1997.Chrysler said the cash rebate on the 1996 Dodge Ram Wagon was increased to $ 1,500 from $ 1,200 , while the rebate on the 1996 Dodge Ram Van Conversion was raised to $ 2,000 from $ 1,600 .
Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday its U.S. light vehicle sales fell 2.2 percent in November as a steep drop in car sales offset gains in trucks , capping off a disappointing month for the industry.Earlier this week General Motors Corp. reported a 12 percent drop in November sales , while Chrylser Corp. reported a 1.4 percent increase.Ford said it sold 290,774 cars and light trucks , compared with 297,362 a year earlier.Domestic car sales fell 11.3 percent to 52,101 units , while light truck sales rose 5.7 percent to 175,606 .
Ford 's import car sales fell 48.2 percent to 1,597.The retail market 's shift from cars to light trucks not only has continued , but is gaining momentum as the year progresses , said Robert Rewey , Ford group vice president of sales and marketing.Ford 's combined Explorer , Mountaineer and Expedition sport utility vehicle sales rose 38 percent to 55,343 units .
Rewey added that Ford planned to ease shortages of its four-wheel-drive vehicles by adding new component capacity in the first quarter of 1997.But November sales of every Ford car line , except the Taurus mid-size sedan , declined from the year-ago period.Taurus sales rose 9 percent to 31,017 , enough to preserve the car 's lead over the Honda Accord in the perennial duel for the best-selling car in the United States .
So far this year , Americans have purchased or leased 363,077 Tauruses vs. 353,328 Accords and 335,906 Toyota Camrys.Ford 's sales brought total industry U.S. car and light truck sales for November to 1,125,582 vehicles , down 1.6 percent from the 1,144,448 units sold a year earlier.The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for the month was 14.9 million units , compared with 14.8 million units a year earlier , and 14.9 million units for the month of October .
The rate is calculated with seasonal factors supplied by the Commerce Department.General Motors on Tuesday reported a 12 percent drop in November sales , fueled by strikes and model changeovers , while Chrylser reported a 1.4 percent increase in sales.Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. were the industry standouts , with sales gains of 19.6 percent and 15.5 percent , respectively.Analysts said the lackluster November results for Detroit 's Big Three automakers did not signal the start of a downturn in the U.S. vehicle market.I think one of the problems in November was that you had Thanksgiving late in the month , with only two selling days after it , compared to six last year , said Smith Barney auto analyst David Healy in New York.December seems to have gotten off to a good start , so I think we'er going to have a good close to the year , he said.For the first 11 months of 1996 , automakers sold 14,010,647 light vehicles , up 2.4 percent on a daily selling rate basis from the 13,590,795 sold a year earlier .
Analysts predicted that the year-end total will be about 15.1 million to 15.2 million vehicles.Automakers sold 486,407 North American-built cars in the United States in November , down 9.7 percent from a year ago .
Domestic truck sales totaled 494,166 during November , up 5.6 percent from a year earlier .
Buoyed by strong sales of light trucks , Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings , but special charges held the automaker back from its best-ever full-year profit.Detroit 's No .
3 automaker posted net income of $ 807 million , or $ 1.12 per share , during the fourth quarter after $ 279 million in charges .
Excluding those charges , Chrysler 's operating earnings were a record $ 1.09 billion , or $ 1.51 a share .
In the fourth quarter of 1995 , Chrysler posted profits of $ 1.04 billion , or $ 1.33 a share.Chrysler 's full-year 1996 net income came to $ 3.53 billion , or $ 4.74 per share , including $ 347 million in special charges .
The total fell short of the company 's 1994 all-time record of $ 3.71 billion.On a pretax basis , Chrysler earned $ 6.09 billion for all of 1996 , a full-year record that topped 1995 's $ 3.45 billion.Chrysler , which was fighting for its life five years ago , rewarded its 79,000 U.S. employees handsomely for the 1996 results , saying they will receive average profit-sharing checks of $ 7,900 in February -- more than double the $ 3,200 they received last year.Comerica Bank economist David Littman estimated that the payments to Chrysler 's 45,000 workers in Michigan could boost the state 's economy by as much as $ 356 million.Wall Street also cheered the results .
Chrysler 's stock rose $ 1.50 a share to close at $ 36 on the New York Stock Exchange.Analysts said shares of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. , which report results next week , rose in sympathy .
GM shares closed up $ 1.25 at $ 62 , while Ford shares closed up 50 cents at $ 33.625.Driving the gains for 1996 was a 10.7 percent increase in worldwide factory vehicle sales , to 2.96 million from 2.67 million in 1995 .
Strong sales of trucks , sport utility vehicles and minivans , pushed Chrysler 's 1996 share of the U.S. and Canadian car and truck market to 16.1 percent from 14.7 percent in 1995.There is no end to the improvements we can achieve if we remain vigilant about controlling our costs and about continually improving our processes and our products , Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement .
That 's the challenge we 're all focused on and its one I 'm confident we 'll meet.During the fourth quarter , Chrysler 's profit was reduced by $ 279 million in charges that covered the early retirement of debt ; higher United Auto Workers pension costs ; a voluntary early retirement program ; and the write-down of Chrysler 's investment in Pentastar Electronics , a defence subsidiary sold to a Huntsville , Ala. , investor group for $ 17 million.Excluding the charges , Chrysler earned $ 1.09 billion for the fourth quarter and $ 3.88 billion for the year , beating two-year-old records for operating results.John Casesa , an analyst at Schroder Wertheim , said a strong mix of high-profit vehicles , such as minivans and Dodge Ram pickup trucks , led to an increase of in the company 's profit margin to 22.3 percent from 20.8 percent.Chrysler 's fourth quarter profit per vehicle -- viewed as the envy of the industry -- rose $ 60 from a year earlier to $ 1,331 , but fell short of the company 's record level of $ 1,350 in the fourth quarter of 1994.It was a good quarter , but I do n't think it was a great quarter , said PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward .
They are not at their peak operating margin.Ward and other analysts said the margin pressure was due to an increase in U.S. incentives per vehicle to $ 660 from $ 495 in 1995 and $ 410 in 1994 .
Increased spending on new products and overseas expansion , as well as higher labour and pension costs , also helped to eat into margins.Still , Chrysler is hitting on all cylinders , and they 're sold out , noted Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.analyst Ron Glantz.Eaton told reporters in a conference call that Chrysler 's financial position was so strong it might not need to dip into its approximately $ 7 billion cash reserve to fund operations and stay profitable during the next industry downturn.That would allow us to use a significant portion of our cash reserves for growth opportunities that might just occur during such a downturn , Eaton said .
Automakers , eager to fill Americans ' insatiable appetite for sport/utility vehicles , plan to introduce a variety of new models at next week 's North American International Auto show here.The annual festival in Detroit features new heights in size , style , luxury and refinement for the once-crude go-anywhere haulers.Analysts are watching most closely the public reaction to Ford Motor Co. 's new luxury behemoth , the Lincoln Navigator , and Chrysler Corp. 's smaller Dodge Durango , which borrows its meaty front-end styling from the Dodge Dakota pickup truck.But they also have their eyes on Subaru 's new Forester , a car-based hybrid sport/utility vehicle that is among the first of a coming new breed of vehicles with truck-like bodies atop passenger car underpinnings.The industry 's continued fixation on sport/utility vehicles is understandable .
U.S. compact sport/utility sales were the second-fastest growing segment in the industry in 1996 , increasing 17.9 percent through November to 1,575,627 units and making up 11.3 percent of the market.The only segment to grow faster was full-size sport/utility vehicles , up 51.5 percent to 379,260 vehicles through November.They 're technically trucks , but a whole lot of people driving them do n't know they 're trucks , said James Holden , Chrysler 's executive vice president of sales and marketing .
The minivans and Jeeps are in suburban garages all over the place , so the definition of trucks is sort of blurring.In 1996 , trucks , including sport/utility vehicles and minivans made up 66 percent of Chrysler 's total vehicle sales.The introduction of the Durango -- slightly larger than Ford 's Explorer -- is expected to push that percentage even higher , and Holden said new sport/utility vehicles will push up other automakers ' truck mix as well.Ford is trying to push the luxury limits of the segment with the Navigator , a vehicle based on the F-150 pickup truck swathed in soft leather and likely to be priced in the same mid- $ 40,000 range as the Range Rover and Lexus LX450 vehicle.Ford also is testing the consumer waters with two other concept sport/utilities , including an all-wheel drive version of its Taurus station wagon and a design study for a future Explorer model featuring more aggressive styling.Mercedes-Benz also aims to whet the appetites of luxury sport/utility buyers by showing off the chassis for its Alabama-built M-Class sport/utility , which enters production next year .
It is not showing off the vehicle 's body , which is expected to be toned down from a concept vehicle shown at last year 's show.Mercedes also will spotlight a segment that has received little attention in recent years -- the luxury coupe -- by introducing its new CLK coupe to the world .
The car borrows its elliptical headlamp styling from the larger E-Class sedan.General Motors Corp. , which dominated last year 's show with the introduction of four new mid-size sedans , is expected to limit its splash to sports car buffs with the introduction of its first all-new Corvette in 14 years.The fifth-generation plastic-bodied 'Vette is expected to offer more power and performance , but also more comfort and interior room for drivers and luggage.More practical cars also are scheduled for introduction , including Ford 's new Escort coupe , and Chrysler 's next-generation LH family sedans -- the Dodge Intrepid , Chrysler Concorde , LHS and Eagle Vision.Toyota Motor Corp will unveil its first serious assault on the U.S. minivan market , an all-new U.S.-built minivan based on the Camry family sedan .
The Toyota Sienna is scheduled for introduction later this year.This is the first real Japanese foray into a North American stronghold , said Michael Robinet , an auto analyst with CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills , Mich. Toyota has gone squarely after Chrysler 's NS minivans.The Detroit auto show is open to the public Jan. 11 through Jan. 20 .
The judge who oversaw the dismantling of the old Ma Bell is worried that a corporate marriage involving the new AT & amp ; T Corp could create the kind of monolith the historic break-up was supposed to do away with.Here 's the advice U.S. Judge Harold Greene would give regulators who must approve any merger of AT & amp ; T and SBC Communications Inc : Be very cautious.Judge Greene brings a lot of history to the matter .
In 1982 , he ordered that the Bell system monopoly be split up .
For more than a decade , he then presided over the consent agreement that created the seven regional Baby Bell phone companies and the new AT & amp ; T , the nation 's No .
1 long-distance carrier.AT & amp ; T now is in talks to merge with San Antonio , Texas-based SBC -- currently the largest provider of local phone service -- in what would be an estimated $ 50 billion-plus transaction .
It would far and away be the biggest such deal in history .
The basic assumption of the break-up was that you could n't have competition , fair competition , as long as there was this massive company that encompassed all areas of the country and all types of service , Judge Greene told Reuters.And the same theory that led to the break-up , he added , could lead one to be suspicious at least of the reemergence of the same monolith .
Judge Greene -- now more of an observer of the telecom business rather than an overseer -- frets that market conditions have not changed that much since the break-up of the Bell monopoly and the consent decree that took effect in 1984 .
The decree set limits on how the phone industry operated.He believes competition has yet to take full root , despite last year 's telecommunications act that tore down decades-old barriers and let the local and long-distance phone companies and cable-television operators enter each other 's business .
There are lots of things that need to be done yet -- both to get the long-distance companies into local service , and local companies into long-distance service .
Nothing is perfected yet , Judge Greene said.It seems kind of surprising that they would now reconstitute the AT & amp ; T empire , at least in one part , he added.I would hope that regulators -- the Federal Communications Commission and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice -- will be very cautious in approving something like that .
Judge Greene 's policing duties in the telecom business ended with the new communications act .
Since the law 's passage , there has been an explosion in merger activity.SBC recently acquired former Baby Bell Pacific Telesis Group .
Bell Atlantic Corp is in the process of acquiring NYNEX Corp. And British Telecommunications Plc is in the midst of buying No .
2 long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp.It 's reported that a merger of AT & amp ; T and SBC would have combined revenues of some $ 80 billion and a workforce of 240,000.SBC 's regional phone system includes California and Texas , following the carrier 's purchase of PacTel.I 'm surprised that somebody wants to put Humpty Dumpty back together , said Judge Green , adding that any new corporate monolith would run counter to the intent of the new telecom law.Certainly I think it was the spirit of the act that there not be a return to monopoly conditions , he said .
Federal regulators and television broadcasters Thursday moved closer to agreeing on a stepped-up timetable for TV stations to begin providing high-definition digital broadcasts within 18 to 24 months.The issue has been a stumbling block in the Federal Communications Commission 's plans to dole out to stations free digital TV licenses in the next two weeks .
The new service promises crystal-clear pictures and CD-quality sound.Under pressure to jump-start the digital age , the National Association of Broadcasters and another industry group , the Association for Maximum Service Television , proposed that 31 stations in the 10 largest metropolitan areas begin broadcasting digital signals in 18 to 24 months.In some markets , up to four stations would be on the air in the shortened time frame .
The top 10 markets include New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Philadelphia and other cities.Broadcasters previously had suggested more time was needed , with many stations saying it would take six years to install the needed equipment and put the digital signals on the air.I welcome the increased level of commitment for launching digital television , said Commissioner Susan Ness , who is trying to broker a pact between the FCC and the broadcasters .
She said the broadcasters ' plans move the ball forward in a very substantial manner.FCC officials stressed , however , that key details must be worked out -- in particular , how many digital broadcasts would begin over 18 to 21 months , something that is important to TV makers trying to offer digital sets in the key Christmas buying season .
Twenty-four months would fall after Christmas 1998.TV set makers have said they would postpone offering digital sets an extra year if stations delayed significant introduction of digital broadcasts until 1999.Ness , as a result , said she has asked broadcasters to better detail TV stations ' plans to be offering digital transmission by Christmas of next year.The roll-out schedule has been a key hurdle .
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt had proposed that big network-owned stations in the top 10 markets start providing digital signals within the next year .
That would translate into 26 large stations.Broadcasters said that was too quick .
Hundt 's office gave the broadcasters ' latest plan a cautiously upbeat response.We 're evaluting it .
But obviously this is a very healthy dialogue between us and the industry , said Hundt 's chief of staff , Blair Levin.Earlier this week Hundt sharply criticised broadcasters , questioning their commitment to digital TV.I 'm beginning to wonder if broadcasters really want these licenses , Hundt told a meeting of the National Cable Television Association in New Orleans .
A cynic would think that broadcasters just do n't want someone else to have them.An official in Commissioner James Quello 's office endorsed the new proposal as an agressive roll-out .
Officials with Commissioner Rachelle Chong 's office could not be reached for comment.Meanwhile , the FCC still must determine the level of public-interest obligations to impose on TV stations in exchange for the digital licenses , as well as other issues .
The Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday it approved Time Warner Inc. 's $ 6.5 billion purchase of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. after the deal was restructured to meet antitrust laws.The FTC , in a 3-2 vote , agreed to permit the revised transaction after the agency had alleged the original merger proposal would have allowed Time Warner unilaterally to raise cable-TV prices and limit the choice of programmes.The two commissioners who voted against the agreement -- Mary Azcuenaga and Roscoe Starek -- said there was no reason to order the deal to be restructured in the first place because it did not violate antitrust laws.Once formally completed , the merger would create the world 's largest media and entertainment concern.The Federal Communications Commission is expected soon to give its approval .
Time Warner and Turner have scheduled separate meetings for Oct. 10 to allow their shareholders to approve the transaction , first announced nearly a year ago.In response to FTC charges , the merger was restructured to curb cable-TV giant Tele-Communications Inc. 's influence over the new company that is to be formed.TCI , the nation 's largest cable-TV operator , now owns 21 percent of Turner stock and would own about 7.5 percent of a combined Time Warner-Turner under the merger , said the FTC .
Time Warner is the No .
2 cable-TV operator.Under the FTC accord , TCI must spin off its Turner stake to shareholders of Liberty Media Corp. , a TCI subsidiary .
The spin-off is contingent on a tax-free ruling from the government .
Otherwise , TCI 's stake would be capped at a 9.2 percent non-voting interest in Time Warner.TCI 's chief , John Malone , and other top TCI officials would be barred from participating in the management of the new Liberty Media corporate entity that is to control the shares.The accord requires Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel to compete with Turner 's Cable News Network.It also bars Time Warner from discriminating in how much it charges competitors for Turner programmes.This settlement would preserve competition and protect consumers from higher cable service prices and reduced programming choices by ensuring that competing cable operators , new technologies and future programmers can gain access to Time Warner/Turner 's customers and programming , said FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky.Aside from being the No .
2 cable-TV operator , Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. movie studios and Time , People , Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines .
In addition to CNN , Turner also owns film and TV studios , a cartoon cable-TV channel and the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks sports teams.We 're disappointed that the FTC did n't block the overall deal , said Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Unions .
But he added that he was encouraged by certain provisions of the agreement that should limit anti-competitive behaviour .
After years of delay , regulators are set to announce approval of plans to create a new type of radio service that offers CD-quality sound and can be heard by listeners coast-to-coast , government officials said Friday.The four members of the Federal Communications Commission have resolved long-standing differences over allocating the two available radio licenses to the four companies seeking to offer so-called Digital Audio Radio Service , or DARS .
The four are : CD Radio Inc. ; American Mobile Radio Corp. , a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. ; Digital Broadcast Satellite Corp. ; and Primosphere.An official who requested anonymity said the FCC approval is expected to be announced soon , possibly later Friday or on Monday.Despite reservations from two commissioners , the agency has decided to limit an auction of the two licenses to the four companies -- which had filed applications with the FCC in the early 1990s .
On Monday , FCC Chairman Reed Hundt had raised the specter of a potential snag .
He insisted an auction should be open to any company that wants to bid , instead of the existing four.Such a wide-open auction could have raised a more money for the government by attracting more bidders.Hundt noted that MCI Communications Corp last year paid $ 683 million to win the last remaining satellite slot to beam television programs nationwide.But the government officials said that the commissioners finally decided to allow the limited auction to proceed , given that the applicants have been waiting for years .
A year after the ValuJet Inc. crash , the top airline regulator suggested Thursday it would be impractical to force air carriers to install fire-safety equipment in passenger cargo holds in less than three years.Under fire for not moving more quickly to promote airline safety , the Federal Aviation Administration plans next month to propose the installation of smoke detectors and fire supressers in all passenger cargo holds over three years.House lawmakers , however , accused the agency of dragging its feet on the installation issue , despite years of warnings from safety regulators on the need to do so .
Lawmakers raised the possibility of a speedier timetable.It could be done in a very short period of time if we want to ground the fleet , Barry Valentine , acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration , told a House panel.That 's the decision .
How much disruption do we citizens want to have in our air transportation , he said.But Representative John Fox , a Pennsylvania Republican , responded , I think we want to have as safe as flights as possible .
And if they have to be a little slower , the public probably would like them to be a little slower.Airline executives on Wednesday announced plans to place both smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in their aircraft , after initially balking at the dual requirement.FAA officials came under attack at the hearing -- from both lawmakers and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -- for not moving more aggressively to implement new safety rules in the wake of the ValuJet crash.This is pathetic .
The FAA is pathetic .
The industry is pathetic , said Representative Peter DeFazio , an Oregon Democrat .
Any more needless deaths and we 're going to crucify you.The FAA announced six months ago plans to issue the fire-safety equipment rules , which will affect about 3,000 aircraft .
But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal.Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we 're in today ?
Or is there really going to be improvement this time ?
asked Representative John Duncan , a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee.Valentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the final assembly.ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May , killing 110 people , because of a fire in the cargo hold .
Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire .
Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners.The head of the NTSB disclosed this week , however , that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident.NTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident .
Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24.It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week .
You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place , that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States , Hall said.An FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB .
Regulators are considering extending consumer safeguards for 900-number phone calls to other pay-per-call services that have zapped unwitting consumers with sky-high phone bills for overseas calls.The Federal Trade Commission Wednesday said it will seek public comment on whether to apply the rules to information and entertainment services that callers dial though a prefix other than 900 .
The 900-number rules require clear cost disclosures and a means for settling billing disputes.The newer services offer callers astrological and travel information , psychic advice and phone sex , among other things .
Scams among audio information or audio entertainment services are a growing problem , according to one official.Officials say providers of the services evade the 900 rules , adopted in 1992 , by diverting calls to numbers in such countries as Guyana , the Dominican Republic , the tiny African country of Sao Tome , or the former Soviet Republic of Moldova.In some cases the first three digits of the number -- such as 809 , 758 or 664 -- resemble area codes in this country.The difference : The overseas calls wind up in countries where the local phone company levies a charge of more than $ 2 a minute for completing the call .
The rate far exceeds costs.Government officials said this allowed the overseas phone company to provide a kickback to the pay-per-call service for each call sent abroad , payments that can drum up business.It has probably helped them to establish a modern telephone system , one FTC official said of the foreign phone companies.Last year 's overhaul of U.S. telecommunication law gave the FTC the authority to expand its 900-number rules to cover similar services not accessed by dialing 900.Those rules give consumers three seconds to hang up after listening to a message disclosing the cost of the service.A service also must spell out its costs .
Calls that cost more than $ 2 must start with a message disclosing the price and identifying the name of the service.The rules also ensure that consumers will not lose their phone service if they fail to pay for a 900 call .
They also establish a mechanism for settling billing disputes.The FTC recently brought a number of cases against alleged international pay-per-call schemes and has issued consumer alerts warning of the costs and risks of such services.Last month it closed three steamy sites on the Internet after consumers complained of huge phone bills to Moldova.The agency alleged that Audiotex Connection of Long Island , N.Y. , and others distributed a sophisticted computer programme that -- unbeknownst to consumers -- caused a computer user 's modem to disconnect from their local Internet access company and dial an overseas pay-per-call number to the former Soviet Republic .
A lawyer for those involved denied wrongdoing.Tim Elliott , president of the TeleServices Industry Association , said new rules were not necessarily needed for his industry .
We police ourselves .
It 's pretty effective.He conceded , There are a lot of folks involved in the industry that are -- I do n't want to say shady -- but who push the envelope .
The bold advice some Baby Bells gave foreign regulators on how to open overseas phone markets now haunts the regional phone companies in the struggle over their own monopolies here at home.Consumer advocates and long-distance carriers such as AT & amp ; T Corp. have jumped on the statements as ammunition in their high-stakes effort to pry open the $ 100 billion local phone market controlled by the regional Bell phone companies.They said the comments , to European and Asian governments in recent years , not only contradicted the Bells ' current views on key matters in the United States but also backed the position of the Bell companies ' rivals.It 's an amazing example of hypocrisy , said Gene Kimmelman , co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union , a consumer group .
Everywhere they 're in as a challenger , they make the very same arguments that consumer advocates and competitors make against their monopoly status in this country.Overseas units of BellSouth Corp. and U S West Inc. , for example , endorsed in 1995 an arcane but important method for putting a price on an existing phone network.The price applies when a new competitor wants to hook up to the network to create their own phone service .
But the Bells oppose that method when it comes to pricing their own networks for long-distance companies and others seeking to offer local phone service under the 1996 communications law.The Bells are asking a U.S. court to overturn landmark Federal Communications Commission rules designed to spur competition through a similar pricing system , saying the rules are counterproductive and would hurt them financially.AT & amp ; T Vice President Mark Rosenblum said the overseas comments underscore that the FCC 's rules reflect sound economic and public policies.But the Bells called the statements ancient history -- some go back more than five years -- and argued it was like comparing apples and oranges .
Telecommunications markets and regulation abroad can differ sharply from practices at home.The arguments were made at a time before there was a need for a single corporate policy , says BellSouth spokesman Bill McCloskey.McCloskey said new laws and rules to open the local phone market here -- such as last year 's communications act -- were not on the books at the time .
They 're digging pretty deep , he said of the critics.Billions of dollars in profits are at stake in the fight.Here 's a sampling of some of the advice : -- BellSouth 's New Zealand unit warned in 1995 that if a monopoly fails to accept the benefits of competition , it can and will use the negotiations on opening its local network to delay and restrict the benefits of competition.Ironically , consumer advocates , AT & amp ; T , MCI Communications Corp. and other potential rivals charge that the Bells have been dragging their feet in the United States. -- BellSouth Europe the same year urged European officials to require monopolies to price their networks to competitors at levels based on the cost of new , more efficient facilities .
Competitors would use the network , or parts of it , to complete their own phone system.The Bells , by contrast , oppose the FCC 's endorsement of forward-looking prices .
Instead , the Bells have said they should receive payments that take account of the higher cost of their existing phone facilities. -- U S West told British regulators in 1995 that the use of forward-looking costs was a fair basis .
The carrier said the formula means new competitors do not have to pay for inefficiencies in the local company 's phone network.We 're comparing apples and oranges , countered U S West spokeswoman Nanci Bernstrom .
She said the accounting rate structure in Britain was vastly different from the one here.Ameritech Corp. spokesman George Stenitzer called comments the company made to Australian regulators in 1990 or 1991 pretty irrelevant .
Critics have cited the statements.Anything we said before 1993 does not reflect our position today , he said .
This was a time when AT & amp ; T said it had no interest in offering local service , he added dryly .
Regulators are expected Wednesday to adopt a landmark overhaul of the nation 's telephone charges to better spread the financial pain of ensuring affordable phone service for Americans.The Federal Communications Commission also hopes its controversial revamp will spur the $ 200 billion phone industry to compete more fiercely for residential customers -- and not just wealthy businesses.We 're trying to reform the system of charges and subsidies to make it more compatible with competition , said FCC Chief Economist Joseph Farrell.The new rules , which stem from last year 's communications law , are designed to keep basic residential phone rates at current levels .
Businesses and residences who make plenty of long-distance calls would see their monthly phone bill drop the most , according to industry officials.Residential and business customers with more than one phone line but who make few or no long-distance calls are expected to see their costs rise .
That would mean an added $ 1 or more a month to maintain a home computer on a second line.Aside from jump-starting competition , the rejigging in charges is meant to cover the $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion cost of wiring schools , libraries and rural hospitals to the Internet , while also keeping phone service affordable for the poor.Progress occurred this past weekend after AT & amp ; T Corp. promised to lower its long-distance rates 5 percent to 15 percent if the FCC agreed to a hefty cut in the charges long-distance carriers pay to access the local phone network.AT & amp ; T Corp. sought a $ 1.7 billion upfront reduction in the $ 23 billion a year in access charges long-distance carriers pay the Baby Bells and other local phone companies.Industry officials expect the FCC to ratify the reduction , paving the way for AT & amp ; T to offer its first big rate cut since 1992 .
Other long-distance carriers are likely to follow suit.The AT & amp ; T pledge -- while drawing criticism from members of Congress and small businesses -- was applauded by consumer groups who until then had attacked the FCC 's plans.This calms the waters more than otherwise , said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group.Industry executives also expect the rules will : -- Keep the monthly subscriber line charge customers pay to the local phone company at $ 3.50. -- Boost the charge for residential customers with more than one line to $ 5 a month from $ 3.50 , and to roughly $ 7 from $ 6 for for multi-line businesses. -- Require long-distance companies to pay local carriers a new pre-subscribed line charge for each long-distance customer .
The charge could be passed on to customers and is expected to range from 75 cents a month for single-line residents to $ 4.50 for multi-line businesses.Second phone lines for home-based business or Internet use and small businesses will be saddled with the brunt of these increases , complained the Small Business Survival Committee , a small business advocacy group.The FCC plan also is drawing flak from members of Congress anxious to see that local phone rates do not rise -- especially in reaction to AT & amp ; T 's weekend announcement.Any local telephone rate increases resulting from the ( FCC 's ) actions to modify access charges would be sharply contrary to congressional intent in passing ( last year 's law ) , Sen. John McCain ( R-Az .
) and Reps. W.J .
Billy Tauzin ( R-La .
) and John Dingell wrote FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.Analysts said that Congress , in passing last year 's bill , saddled the FCC with a mammoth task .
They 're trying to bring about a system that will be more conducive to competition while navigating around some very perilous political shoals , said Dwight Allen of Deloitte & amp ; Touche Consulting Group .
Regulators are considering ways to make it easier for cash-strapped winners at last year 's $ 10.2 billion wireless phone auction to pay Uncle Sam for their licenses , government and industry officials said.Congress is counting on the proceeds to trim the deficit.But many of the companies that won licenses to offer a new generation of cellular phone service are now in financial hot water , raising doubts over whether the government will collect all the money owed .
Any steps the Federal Communications Commission takes will send a message to future bidders and affect future airwave sales .
The FCC is going to be setting a new precedent , a government official said.Government and industry officials said the FCC is considering restructuring the payments that last year 's auction winners must make to the government .
The agency is expected to seek public comment soon on various proposals.The bids have become loans from the government , with the winners paying interest on the money that 's due for licenses to offer personal communications services ( PCS ) .
The companies paid what were considered high prices .
Many have since found it tough to raise financing.The options under study at the FCC include : -- Handling each company in a case-by-case manner .
That way , payments could be restructured on an individual basis. -- Deferring payments for a number of years -- say five , for example -- after which companies would make their interest payments and then pay off the remaining principal amount due .
The breathing space would give companies time to build their PCS networks and make some money .
-- Letting winners pay , up front , a discounted lump sum based on interest payments otherwise due in the future.The FCC also has been negotiating with the Treasury Department for help and advice .
The FCC is not particularly expert in this area and never expected to be in it , the government official said.In addition , several winners -- including top bidder NextWave Telecom Inc. -- have asked the FCC for permission to make interest payments yearly , instead of quarterly .
Last month , the FCC suspended the quarterly payments while it mulled the request -- a move that , according to one estimate , is costing the government $ 1.5 million daily.Government and industry officials said the FCC is in a tough spot , especially because Congress is depending on the auction revenues to help balance the government 's books.If companies were to default on their payments and the FCC were to reauction the licenses , the new prices probably would be far less than the original amounts bid , analysts agreed .
Many of the auction winners will soon face financial crises if the FCC does not act swiftly and decisively to change the license payment terms , MCI Communications Corp. told the FCC earlier this month.The No .
2 long-distance company -- which has signed a deal to lease NextWave 's PCS network to provide wireless services to MCI customers -- wants the FCC to handle the companies ' problems on a case-by-case basis.But others urge the FCC to reject that approach .
They want the agency to develop a general rule -- through its usual rulemaking process -- that would apply to all companies .
We are concerned that whatever the FCC does , it does it fairly and equally across the board , attorney Mark Tauber of Piper & amp ; Marbury said .
It 's bad 'PR ' for the commission if they give the idea that special deals are available.AirGate Wireless , which won four PCS licenses at an auction that ended early this year , wants the FCC to take more aggressive action : reinstate the quarterly interest payments ; declare companies in default if they fail to make payments ; and reauction the licenses of those in default.Anything less sends a message to existing licensees and future auction bidders that the FCC will provide a financial safety net for bidders that bid beyond their financial capabilities , the Washington-based firm told the FCC.Meanwhile , the companies are expected to get some help from a recent global trade agreement that will make it easier for foreign communications companies to invest in U.S. carriers .
The FCC is developing a proposal to implement the agreement , which could pave the way for foreign sources of money .
Opponents of U.S. trade concessions to China are expected to mount the fiercest congressional battle in years to overturn President Bill Clinton 's decision to renew China 's favoured trading status.While supporters of the president 's decision on Monday to renew China 's most favoured nation ( MFN ) status for another year remain confident of victory , opponents -- ranging from social conservatives to organised labour -- are revving up for a fight.The unusual coalition is blasting the move from both sides of the political spectrum , hitting China 's policies on human rights , labour rights , religious rights , trade and abortion.Opponents are also gathering strength from worries over the transfer this summer of Hong Kong to China , as well as the brouhaha over charges that Beijing tried to sway U.S. elections through illegal campaign contributions.With Hong Kong and campaign finance lurking in the background , it will definitely be a tougher fight , a congressional aide , who requested anonymity , said .
A lot depends on what happens between now and the vote.Another congressional aide said , The coalition of the AFL-CIO and social conservatives makes for a potent force.House Speaker Newt Gingrich said this year 's decision would be closer than last year 's 286-141 vote in the House to back Clinton on MFN .
But advocates and even opponents expect the president 's policy ultimately to survive.Even if lawmakers muster enough votes to reject the president 's decision -- which is considered unlikely -- opponents doubt they could round up the two-thirds vote needed to override an expected veto from Clinton.Congress later this summer will vote on whether to overturn Clinton 's decision , with the House voting first.The opponents have a better chance than they have had in the past several years .
But it still may not be enough of a margin to withstand a veto , said Thea Lee , international expert at the AFL-CIO , which opposes MFN status for China.But even a defeat for MFN 's opponents could amount to a sort of victory if the vote is close enough.It represents an important turning point in the growing uneasiness among both Democrats and Republicans over the current China trade policy , Lee said.Gary Bauer , president of the conservative Family Research Council , said : The president 's action represents the high-water mark of the pro-MFN forces .
As the truth of the human rights violations in China reaches the American public , the case for MFN collapses.A sign Clinton will face tougher sledding emerged a week ago , when an influential House Republican leader urged the president to revoke China 's MFN status , citing Beijing 's record on human rights , weapon sales and trade.Representative Bill Paxon of New York , a Gingrich ally who chairs meetings of the Republican House leadership team , said current U.S. policy had yielded only a Chinese regime which thumbs its nose at the United States and places its heel on the neck of freedom.Democratic lawmakers echo that view.Since Clinton delinked trade from human rights three years ago , the human rights situation in China and Tibet has deteriorated , the U.S. trade deficit with China has soared , and China 's authoritarian government has continued its sale of nuclear , chemical , missile and biological weapons technology to dangerous countries , including Iran , Representative Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , said.But supporters of the administration 's policy remain confident .
In the end , the votes will be there for MFN , said Calman Cohen of the Emergency Committee for American Trade , representing the heads of big U.S. corporations .
Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd reported healthy 1996 earnings in line with expectations on Wednesday , but analysts warned the outlook remains mixed despite upbeat comments from tycoon Li Ka-shing.Basically it was in line with what the market was forecasting , propped up by the HK $ 4.1 billion exceptional from the Orange flotation earlier in the year , said ING Barings analyst Nam Park.But the outlook is pretty mixed , he said .
I think I 'll be revising my numbers downwards.Hutchison is 48.9 percent owned by Cheung Kong ( Holdings ) Ltd and has interests in property , energy , telecommunications , container terminal operations and retailing.Despite weakness in most of its major divisions last year , Hutchison maintained earnings momentum by spinning off British mobile phone operator Orange Plc in April 1996.The exceptional gain -- described by one analyst as recurrent income because Hutchison maintained its dividend payout ratio -- helped to boost 1996 net profit to HK $ 12.02 billion ( US $ 1.55 billion ) compared to HK $ 9.57 billion in 1995.Although the company failed to give a detailed financial breakdown , analysts said the numbers suggested the company 's telecoms and property divisions performed poorly last year while parts of the container business did reasonably well.The outlook is slightly better in 1997 thanks to Orange , which has been performing better than expected , and the spin-off of a Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd holding into subsidiary , Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd.It 's a pretty mixed outlook , said Park .
But I think the real swing factor could be the telecoms side.Hutchison chairman Li Ka-shing said the company 's cellular telephone subscriber base is now about 340,000 and costs would plunge with the changeover from analogue to digital systems.With its solid base of recurrent quality income , strong cash flow and financial position , the Group is well positioned to move forward to the next century with confidence , Li said.But analysts said Hutchison faces an increasingly competitive telecoms market in Hong Kong , and 49-percent-held Orange remains a loss-making business despite early strength.Analysts said the property division would continue to suffer from a lack of property developments , despite Li 's comments that investment income offset any decline in property development income and rental income would remain strong this year.It 'll be 1998/99 before it 's back to property being a source of significant growth , said John Hetherington , analyst at Asia Equity.The container terminals division , however , seems set to improve .
Analysts said Li suggested that Hongkong International Terminals Ltd ( HIT ) enjoyed double digit growth.Given that other operators saw a three percent drop ( in container traffic ) HIT was obviously the other beneficiary , said Raymond Chong at Yaimichi Securities.The medium-term outlook is much more positive , thanks to Hutchison 's exposure to Chinese exports.Medium term I 'm very bullish .
I 'm bullish on China trade flows and Hutch is all up and down the coast of China , said Hetherington.He is forecasting 1997 earnings of HK $ 3.60 per share , an estimate another analyst described as very aggressive.Earnings per share in 1996 were HK $ 3.32 .
( US $ 1 = HK $ 7.74 ) While the issue of Hong Kong 's civil liberties after its return to China has grabbed the international spotlight , the territory 's people remain concerned about a more insidious threat -- corruption.Future leader Tung Chee-hwa 's efforts to cool local and international fears about plans to curb civil rights have eclipsed an issue that has persistently taken top spot in local surveys as the biggest concern tied to Hong Kong 's return to China on July 1 , analysts said.This is the thing people are most concerned about , said Michael DeGolyer , a political scientist at the Baptist University of Hong Kong.We asked people which post-1997 aspects worried them most in July 1996 , December 1996 and February 1997 .
It ( corruption ) was number one out of a total of seven various aspects ... three times in a row .
It 's been number one there for over a year.Political analysts said the implications of a rise in corruption associated with Hong Kong 's handover to Chinese rule were enormous.Fears abound that the Chinese style of doing business , called guanxi or being connected to the right people , will erode the rule of law , which is considered essential to confidence in Hong Kong and its longer-term competitiveness.The prosperity of Hong Kong is very much based on upholding the rule of law , its respect for due process .
These are very important factors for Hong Kong to function as an international and regional financial centre , said Professor Joseph Cheng of the City University of Hong Kong.Political analysts said that while there was clear evidence of growing Chinese influence in Hong Kong 's business , people were less concerned about guanxi seeping across the border than they were about individual Hong Kong businessmen exploiting the new style of doing business to their advantage.The business community sees the establishment of relationships in China as very important business assets , and we all know corruption facilitates the establishment of such relationship networks , Cheng said.Businessmen usually say they support fair competition while they make relationship contacts .
So we could see this spread of relationship networks and the willingness to use bribery to seal business deals.DeGolyer said it was essential that Tung started to promote Hong Kong 's continued integrity aggressively , with a strong focus on the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) .The anti-graft agency has been widely acknowledged as crucial to Hong Kong 's reputation as a respectable place to do business.He should be incessantly beating the drum about the ICAC , DeGolyer said .
He should be hammering away about its independence , its being above board , that he will support it.The powerful ICAC was set up in 1974 when corruption was endemic in Hong Kong.Cheng added that corruption , while not an immediate risk , could be devastating over the longer term.The whole process is a very gradual one .
Corruption spreads gradually , and you do n't just say 'There 's corruption and I withdraw my investment .
' It takes time , he said .
One of Asia 's most powerful women is drawing up a battleline in Hong Kong ready for an era of political uproar unseen elsewhere in the People 's Republic.Twenty-seven days before Britain hands the colony back to China , Hong Kong 's top civil servant , is targeting a powerful group of businessmen surrounding future leader Tung Chee-hwa.She is tough , charming Anson Chan .
The 57-year-old Chinese administrator , dubbed an iron fist in a velvet glove , is one of Hong Kong 's most popular personalities.Headlines daily feature her in a tug-of-war for the political soul of the billionaire ex-shipping magnate , a China appointee under pressure to win the confidence of Hong Kong and the world.A conservative without a political track record , he was suddenly called on to be Hong Kong 's future chief executive , replacing the departing , reformist colonial governor Chris Patten.As part of the colonial legacy , civil servants rather than elected politicians run the Hong Kong government , so the voice of Chan , their chief , carries unusual clout.She acts as Patten 's deputy and is also to become Tung 's second-in-command.Chan has chosen to assert her sweeping authority in the dying days of colonial rule in a face-off against a group of influential pro-China business cronies chosen by Tung to advise him on how to run Hong Kong.The 6.4 million people of Hong Kong , unsure of the future under the red flag after the July 1 handover , are anxiously watching to see if an imminent showdown will crack open the new power structure.Both Chan and the advisers will sit on the Executive Council , an inner cabinet positioned between the Chief Executive and the legislature.She 's not exactly cracking the whip over Tung , but raising the flag over her own continued centrality , said Michael DeGolyer , political analyst at Baptist University of Hong Kong.She 's saying Tung is ours , and he 's not going to belong to , basically , sycophants and plutocrats.Chan , in a Newsweek interview this week , said she was less concerned about direct interference by China in Hong Kong 's autonomy than she was about groups who might court interference either for misplaced motives or , worse still , for narrow , selfish , vested interests.Maybe some people feel that decisions affecting business are not in their interest .
They may feel they should go up and appeal to various leaders .
That would be very bad for Hong Kong , Chan said.Pro-China politician Lau Siu-kai said the comments indicated that disagreements between Tung and his senior civil servants had reached crisis levels.It shows some senior officials are sceptical over the integrity , capability and poiltical orientation of the people appointed by Mr Tung , Lau told the South China Morning Post.But DeGolyer dismissed speculation that her words signalled a widening rift between Tung and his senior civil servants.It 's not so much a rift as it is ( a demonstration ) to other civil servants that she is the person in charge , and she will remain in charge .
There will be no change , DeGolyer said .
( She is saying ) there is no difference between a governor appointed by far-away London and a chief executive appointed by far-away Beijing .
They will continue on with business as usual.He described the new government as an engine going nowhere without a civil service to kick the transmission into gear.The engine can sit there are rev .
all it wants but if the gears are not engaged , they 're not going anywhere .
And that 's where she sits , he said.Analyst Bob Broadfoot of the think-tank Political and Economic Risk Consultancy , said Chan significantly decided to speak out now because Executive Council rules will prevent her from doing so once the new government takes power.Tung 's decision to reappoint Chan , along with the entire top echelon of Hong Kong 's civil service , was welcomed by the business and international community for its stabilising effect.But in the Newsweek interview , Chan warned that Tung was unfamiliar with the way government machinery works .
Europe 's envoy in Hong Kong on Thursday said the European Union had lost credibility by falling into public disarray over a resolution at the United Nations designed to censure China for human rights violations.We are now not as credible an interlocutor matching the commercial clout we have because we are not united , Etienne Reuter , head of the European Commission in Hong Kong , said in an interview with Reuters.We have n't helped our own image , and we have n't helped the cause of furthering human rights in China ...
It has certainly weakened our position here , the envoy said.The Geneva resolution , sponsored by Denmark and backed by the United States , failed to win EU support when France said that recent human rights improvements by China suggested dialogue was better than confrontation.This is the first year the EU has failed to back the resolution since the 1989 Beijing massacre , when China crushed democracy protesters in a bloody crackdown around Tiananmen Square.This means that ... when ( people in Hong Kong ) look for help or support they will tend to look first to North America or maybe even to Japan , rather than believe the Europeans have the cards to play .
That is , I think , the sad reality , Reuter said.Denmark , the United States and human rights activists condemned the EU 's silence , which fell in the year that Hong Kong reverts from British to Chinese rule.The United States is also usually seen as the most outspoken defender of human rights in Hong Kong , but Reuter argued Europe also should have a role to play.Under the one country , two systems formula , Hong Kong will retain considerable autonomy for 50 years as a Special Administrative Region within China.But as the July 1 handover nears , concern is rising that many key freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people will soon be lost.Moves by future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa to trim civil liberties have provoked condemnation from many sides in Hong Kong and prompted criticism from the United States.Beijing responded by telling the United States to stop meddling in China 's internal affairs.The EU 's Reuter said he hoped the Geneva debacle reminded Europe that its future influence in Hong Kong depended upon unity , particularly as the handover approaches.The indications for a smooth transition ... are good , so I would not like to paint a dark scenario for the future , but I certainly think it is important for the Europeans to realise they can only be effective here if they are united , he said.The incident also had drawn attention to Europe 's urgent need for a common foreign policy , one geared more to common interests rather than values.You will always have realists versus idealists , and people thinking , 'Why should it be our job to be the world 's policeman or the world 's preacher ?
' ( This ) is a discussion which concerns everybody in Europe and not only France , he said.An outstanding deal by an Airbus Industrie-led consortium to build a 100-seat plane in a Chinese joint venture had little to do with France 's objection , Reuter said.I do n't think people should think it 's only because of a couple of Airbuses that France did not support the concept of the resolution in Geneva , he said.French President Jacques Chirac is due to sign the deal during a visit to China in May , although Beijing said recently that more work was needed to finalise the contract and called upon the European side to offer better terms .
Asian stocks face a jittery week , anticipating a rise in the U.S. Federal funds rate at the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting on Tuesday.Concerns about interest rates caused the U.S. Dow Jones index to fall this past week .
The index fell 15 points on Friday to 6805 although rate fears were n't seen as a major factor for the day.But the rate jitters are expected to be exacerbated in Asia by local factors ranging from Taiwan 's ban on all pork exports due to an outbreak of deadly hog foot-and-mouth disease to continued gloom in Singapore because of poor export figures.- - - -HONG KONG - Share prices have taken a beating over recent weeks due to uncertainty over whether the U.S. interest rates will go up , but analysts said stocks could move higher once Tuesday 's FOMC meeting is out of the way.The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 247.23 points , or 1.94 percent , in the past week to close at 12,489.30 on Friday.If they announce a 25 basis point rise , Hong Kong will probably recover to around the 13,000 level because I think it ( selling ) is just overdone , said ING Barings sales director James Osborn.Analysts said earnings growth was strong and that , whatever the Fed meeting brought , the uncertainty would be cleared and investors could focus on local fundamentals.- - - -TOKYO - Tokyo stocks are expected to plough higher as investors try to ensure the indices finish the fiscal year ending March 31 on a positive note , brokers said.Hopes that the government plans to revive the stagnant property market will provide psychological support and the start of a new trading month will make it easier -- for dealers especially -- to buy , said Hisao Suzuki , Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd deputy general manager.The 225-share Nikkei benchmark index closed up 139.45 points , or 0.75 percent , at 18,633.16 on Friday , capping a five-session winning streak in which it gained 3.5 percent.Brokers said the market will await any hints on details of a government scheme to improve land liquidity , which would help financial firms dispose of their bad property assets .
The final plan will be unveiled on March 31.- - - -TAIPEI - Taiwan share prices are expected to consolidate in the week beginning March 24 following Taiwan 's ban on all pork exports due to an outbreak of hog foot-and-mouth disease.The ban sent the island 's food and livestock shares tumbling on Friday .
Brokers said food shares can expect more losses and recent government attempts to cool what is seen as an overheated stock market will also dampen sentiment.The weighted index plunged 262.60 points to 8,230.07 on Friday , compared to an 8,275.57 finish a week earlier .

It 's not a problem with me , Tung told reporters.But he cautioned that he prized public order.Hong Kong society is now very stable , very good .
It is something we are very proud of and I said it would be sad if in such a successful and peaceful society , lives started to change , he said.Tung 's relaxed approach and easy demeanour belied the storm of controversy created by his proposals , which would require police permission for public demonstrations and prohibit foreign funding for local political parties.While defending his proposals as really far less restrictive than laws in most North American cities , Tung stressed the importance of good Sino-U.S. relations - a subject that surfaced in his talks in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and chief of Hong Kong policy Lu Ping .
( Qian ) has been in the United States recently , and I 'm very glad that the relationship is developing well .
It is a very positive development and that has very important implications for Hong Kong 's future , Tung said.His inner cabinet has already started to draw up legislation to change the laws - just hours after one of Tung 's key advisers hinted that some relaxation of the original plans was possible after a three-week public consultation period.There are many proposals that have been put forward to us , Henry Tang told reporters earlier on Wednesday .
In the consultation exercise , there are more liberal ( proposals ) than what is in the consultation document.Tung said he told Qian that handover arrangements were going well , and said they had agreed that there should be no change in existing tourist visa arrangements for all countries with Hong Kong consulates.We have talked about quite a few things but basically its been some time since we saw each other and ... he would like to know how everything is and I was able to assure him that everything was coming along very nicely , Tung said.In a television broadcast earlier on Wednesday , Tung repeated his commitment to a democratic society in Hong Kong.Actually over the next 10 years , we have a very progressive but orderly development of a political structure which will become increasingly democratic , Tung said in an interview with CNBC Asia Television.He was referring to the gradual democratisation envisaged in the Basic Law , Hong Kong 's post-handover constitution promulgated by China in 1990.Tung said Hong Kong was following a path of development set by other Asian nations.In Asia ... economic success and freedom has preceded political development , he said .
And in Hong Kong , of course , we have tremendous economic success and economic freedom , and political freedom ... is something as a colony we really never had until about six years ago ... we are now developing it .
With the memory of Thailand 's banking sector implosion still fresh , alarm bells are starting to sound about banks ' property exposure in Hong Kong.Massive capital inflows into the territory , most driven by optimism about Hong Kong 's reversion to China at midnight on June 30 , have fuelled an explosion in bank loans for property.The enthusiasm evokes memories of the building boom that helped push Thailand to the brink of economic collapse earlier this year , with banks weighted under by bad loans.Widely viewed as Hong Kong 's most accurate confidence indicator , soaring property prices are considered by many people to be yet another sign that all is well with the territory 's handover to China just around the corner.But others are urging officials to check out the foundations on which the boom is built.There appears to be an assumption among Hong Kong bankers -- not to mention their clients -- that they can print as much money as needed to keep property and other asset prices in orbit indefinitely , said Hugh Peyman in a recent report by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson ( DKB ) .David Lui , director at Schroder Securities , took up the same issue at a public forum on Tuesday.If property prices continue to rise , that will affect the soundness ( of the financial sector ) , Lui said.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority ( HKMA ) , the territory 's de facto central bank , warned late last month that additional restraints in mortgage lending might be required , taking some of the steam out of Hong Kong 's hyperactive stock market.Profit-taking hit property counters on Wednesday despite the Hang Seng Index 's overall recovery from early lows .
The blue-chip index was up 105 points , or 0.73 percent , at 14,545 at midday , while the property sub-index was down 0.48 percent.DKB dismissed the HKMA 's warning as tepid.The horse may already have bolted , Peyman said .
The pressure on the HKMA not to ( do ) anything to stop the current asset price orgy is clear enough , particularly with the handover only a month away.Outstanding property lending has risen 26 percent in one year .
Property and construction now account for 47 percent of all Hong Kong lending , Peyman said.These massive increases in property lending have taken place against a backdrop of the lowest new supply of residential flats in 23 years , he said.Mortgage loans now account for 22 percent of all loans , and loans to developers have hit HK $ 363 billion ( US $ 46.5 billion ) -- up 18 percent over six months and 30 percent over one year.Hong Kong 's fixed exchange rate and open capital account leave the HKMA very little room to manoeuvre to calm the frenzy , except to resort to aggressive hands-on lending restrictions.Local banks are already restricted to a 40 percent property exposure , but the HKMA has no control over foreign banks who usually enter late in a boom and give the biggest boost to lending as they grab for market share at any cost.DKB said the figures are worrying enough to suggest tougher HKMA action to dampen down credit expansion before the September International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting in Hong Kong.But other analysts adopted a more sanguine view.The start-up of a new mortgage corporation later this year will eat up some of the banks loans as property debts are securitised , said Clive McDonnell , economist at SocGen Crosby.More important than lending restrictions are plans already announced by the new Hong Kong government to increase supply.There has been a level of excess liquidity and that 's been feeding through into property prices , McDonnell said .
However , long-term trends will affect the short term .
People will not pile into property if trend supply increases.Financial Secretary Donald Tsang has already pledged to release 51 hectares of land for development over the next five years , which translates into about 30,500 units each year. -- Hong Kong newsroom ( 852 ) 2834 6441. http : //www , hk97.com Fears are rising in Hong Kong that a symbolic gesture by the Democratic Party early on the territory 's first day under China will turn nasty despite the Democrats ' commitment to peaceful protest.Hong Kong 's largest party says it will occupy the chamber of parliament , expressing anger at the elected assembly 's death as a globally-televised handover ceremony and gala takes place nearby.I 'm really afraid ( if ) something goes wrong at this time , and it 's not anybody 's fault , said Bob Broadfoot , who manages the think-tank Political and Economic Risk Consultancy.That would be such a bad thing for Hong Kong right now and who wants that ?
If something like that happens , fingers will point and everyone will be blaming everyone else.In a move bound to irritate China , which regularly warns against subversion , Democratic Party vice-chairman Yeung Sam confirmed a plan to protest the swearing-in of a new legislature after Hong Kong returns to Chinese control at midnight June 30.The protest will highlight the most contentious issue of Hong Kong 's return to China -- the Beijing-appointed interim legislature will replace the existing , democratically-elected parliament , to the dismay of democrats and the West.Yeung said a delegation of Democrats is determined to enter the Legislative Council ( Legco ) chamber and , in a symbolic gesture , pledge support for democracy as well as China 's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong through speeches issued from the chamber 's balcony.The protest will take place just as the new provisional legislature is being sworn in - a ceremony Western leaders including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have pledged to avoid.Future leader Tung Chee-hwa and police chiefs were not available to outline how they would respond.Yeung on Wednesday reiterated his party 's support for peaceful , non-violent protest but repeated earlier statements threatening radical action if the delegation was obstructed.I think it 's better we wait and see , Yeung told Reuters , when asked what radical meant.I can only say we are determined to go back to Legco ... .We want to declare our determination in a symbolic gesture but we hope this can be carried out in a peaceful manner .
So I will stop from speculating what we will do.He did , however , reveal that negotiations were still under way with Tung 's office , which has apparently advised the Democrats against holding rallies.The thing is , can we come back to the Legco building ?
We are still talking about that , Yeung said.The protest plans confirm expectations long held in Hong Kong that the Democrats would use the presence of more than 6,000 journalists from around the world to lobby for democracy in China 's newest Special Administrative Region.The plans are restricted so far to the Democratic Party , Hong Kong 's loudest political group , but independent Democrat Emily Lau said other legislative groups had been invited to take part.We appreciate people have different ways of expression , Lau said .
Is that confrontation ?
I certainly do n't think that 's confrontation ... They just want to do some gesture .
I do n't think it 's something that is really that intolerable .
So I do n't see why ( the police would ) want to create a scene .
Hong Kong 's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang took a political gamble by accepting a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth in the last days of British colonial rule , political analysts said on Monday.Some believe his acceptance of the honour could antagonise China and ensure his early resignation from a sensitive post as the second most powerful bureaucrat in executive-led Hong Kong.All these guys are going to be transitional figures .
Call me in a year and see if he 's still around , said one leading political scientist who declined to be identified.But others argue that China ignores such honours , which have been liberally bestowed upon members of Hong Kong 's old and new elites.So I do n't think it 's that big an issue , especially given this environment where the Chinese are trying to absorb the British establishment , said Joseph Cheng , professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong.Tsang , effectively finance minister , has made little public reference to the award , except to say that he remains committed to Hong Kong after 30 years in the civil service.But some analysts said his decision to accept the honours , routinely given to top civil servants in Hong Kong , was significant just a few days before Britain hands back the colony on July 1.Tsang 's acceptance of the knighthood was thrown into high relief by civil service head Anson Chan 's decision to decline the same honour , which would have made her a Dame in line with his Sir prefix.The popular Chan , widely considered one of the most powerful women in Asia , first declined to be knighted in 1992 when her name cropped up as a possible contender for chief executive , an appointment she chose not to pursue.The post went to Tung Chee-hwa , the billionaire shipping tycoon who will replace departing colonial governor Chris Patten at midnight on June 30.Not giving ( Chan ) a knighthood will probably protect her as she is the leader of the civil service , said Sunny Lo , professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong.But it could also be an attempt to cement a relationship between Tung and Chan , who has very publicly announced her readiness to resign on principle if necessary after July 1.The British administration support the alliance between Anson Chan and Tung Chee-hwa and this seems to be confirmed in giving the knighthood to Tsang and not Chan , Lo said.But he declined to be drawn on whether Tsang 's acceptance of the award would make him vulnerable to Chinese antagonism in the same way Chan 's refusal might protect her from it.City University 's Cheng argued that the issue was , to all intents and purposes , irrelevant.The vast majority of these people accept them , he said , referring to Hong Kong 's honoured elites .
Such titles are so common they are virtually meaningless , Cheng said.The knighthood will not affect Tsang 's future career .
He 's already reached the top level so having the knighthood wo n't make any difference , Lo said .
Merging the Hong Kong dollar with China 's renminbi is impossible in the short-term and unlikely in the long-term , a panel of experts said on Monday.A currency merger could only be contemplated once China 's capital account is fully open , allowing for free movement of financial assets in and out of the country , they told a conference organised by the Far Eastern Economic Review .
They said this could take at least five years.Economically , the fact that the Renminbi is still not a fully-convertible currency also argues against a possible merging of the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi as Hong Kong needs a convertible currency to maintain its status as an international financial centre , said T.C .
Chan , head of investment banking for Citibank in Hong Kong.But Hong Kong can still look forward to 50 years of autonomous control of its monetary system , as enshrined in agreements governing Hong Kong 's reversion to Chinese control and the Basic Law , Hong Kong 's mini-constitution.If we set aside the political considerations , which are largely judgmental , the merging of the Hong Kong dollar with the Renminbi is simply legally not possible , Chan said.Reforming state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) will be key to convertibility for China , said Andrew Freris , Bank of America managing director in Hong Kong.The SOEs , plagued by debt , have compromised China 's banking sector .
SOEs must be reformed to return integrity to China 's banks , Freris told the conference.Only when the banking sector has reduced its exposure to the SOEs will China be able to establish a fully-functioning interbank market , which can then act as the vehicle to establish market-determined interest rates , Freris said.The market must have the capacity to allow domestic rates ( to ) rise far enough to attract or repel capital , he said .
If you do not have fully operational market-determined interest rates , convertibility is a non-starter.Instead of anticipating the eradication of its own currency , Hong Kong should look forward to convertibility of the Chinese yuan for the opportunities it will present , Freris said.Hong Kong will be able to derive more business from fund flows in and out of China , he said .
But I do think that two monetary systems will remain separate .
The fact the renminbi becomes convertible will not affect the separateness of the two systems.The idea of two monetary systems co-existing within one sovereign state is not unusual , Freris argued.Argentina countered hyperinflation for many years by allowing its freely convertible peso to function alongside a U.S. dollarised economy.Brazil and Uruguay are similarly dollarised , with U.S. currency used for all major transactions , he said .
An army of financial market regulators were poised on Sunday to descend on NatWest Markets , the investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank , which on Friday announced a 50 million pound ( $ 81.4 million ) hole in its options trading book.The Securities and Futures Authority , which licenses options traders , and the Bank of England , which regulates banks generally , both said they would be working closely together to establish what had gone wrong at NatWest Markets.Supervisors work closely together and there is no doubt that we will talking about what has happened at NatWest , a Bank of England spokesman told Reuters.But the spokesman could not confirm a formal joint investigation with the SFA , reported in some newspapers on Sunday.The Serious Fraud Office , which investigates large fraud cases in Britain said it was not yet involved.We are not investigating the case , it has not been referred to us and it 's not appropriate to speculate about whether it will be , an SFO spokesman said on Sunday.It also remained unclear on Sunday whether the operations of interest rate options trader , named by banking sources as Kyriacos Papouis , who now works for U.S. securities house Bear Stearns , included any element of fraudulent behaviour.At the moment , this looks like a trader trying to trade his way out of a loss , a banking source said , but it 's not clear how or why , or how it took so long to discover.A spokeswoman for NatWest Markets said the deals had taken place over a period of time in 1996 and had come to light only in the last few days.She confirmed the suspension of a senior options trader at NatWest Markets , named by sources as Neil Dodgson .
A spokesman for Dodgson said he could not comment on the case but would be co-operating fully with any investigations.The case is sure to raise again the question of supervision of derivatives trading , especially as all City firms went through an apparently exhaustive review of their risk management control systems in the wake of the Barings collapse in 1995.Investment bank Barings collapsed under losses of 800 million pounds after rogue trader Nick Leeson embarked on a spree of unauthorised derivatives trading.While the current case does not compare in terms of scale and does seem to have been nipped in the bud , it will still cause major waves around the City.We are making a very thorough review of our control systems -- both internal and external , the NatWest Markets spokeswoman said .
This is a business that requires constant scrutiny , you can never be complacent about the control procedures.The question in the NatWest case is whether the mis-pricing of the options was done for personal gain or to hide the real position or was just hopelessly bad trading.NatWest is also likely to face criticism in the coming days over the suspicion that it already knew of the loss when it announced its 1996 results last week.NatWest has vigorously denied this , saying it brought the matter to light as soon as possible and has kept regulators fully informed.NatWest also said no client has been affected .
Some sources said Natwest should perhaps have said no client has been adversely affected since the 50 million pounds must be showing up as a gain in a trading book somewhere .
( $ = 0.614 British Pounds ) Interest rates on British home loans may rise this year due to upward pressure on savings rates , even if a new government does not immediately tighten monetary policy , analysts said on Thursday.This is a separate issue from the question of whether the government should raise interest rates to nip inflation in the bud after the general election on May 1 , they said.The flotation of four building societies and the takeover of another will free as much as 140 billion pounds ( $ 225 billion ) of savings locked in nearly 30 million accounts in the societies , which provide home mortages.This is around 25 percent of British retail savings and analysts expect a good proportion of this to be moved.I expect 15 billion pounds to be moved as a conservative estimate , said UBS building societies analyst Rob Thomas .
The effect will be to push up savings rates and , since mortgage lending is largely funded from savings , mortgage margins will come under pressure and rates may rise.Halifax , Britain 's largest mortgage lender with 20 percent of the market ; Woolwich ; Alliance & amp ; Leicester and Northern Rock are ending their mutual society status and floating on the stock market.Savers had to deposit money in these building societies to qualify for free shares .
But once the societies have floated , savers can move their money where they want.The societies will have to fight hard to keep hold of the money as other institutions such as Abbey National and Cheltenham & amp ; Gloucester , part of the Lloyds TSB Group want to grab a big chunk of the cash.Analysts expect a fair proportion of the money to flow into pure spending or to other financial products such as unit trusts .
But they also expect a large amount to be up for grabs within the savings and loan industry.On Wednesday , Abbey National , which converted to bank status and floated in 1990 , pointedly noted that much of the money can already be moved as members have already qualified for shares.The Bradford & amp ; Bingley Building Society , proclaiming its continued mutual ownership , said it would effectively raise savings rates and cut mortgage rates.Thomas of UBS said the spread between mortgage rates and base rated was low historically following mortgage rate cuts in 1995 which outstripped an easing base rate.Pressure on savings rates could trigger a rise for borrowers if institutions want to maintain margin which has already been difficult to do .
This might even result in a round of mortgage rate rises not associated with a base rate rise , Thomas said.David Poutney , banking analyst at Panmure Gordon expects the situation to be an opportunity for banks such as Abbey National .
While competitive pressure will increase , the freeing up of the market will increase new business opportunities for the likes of the Abbey , he said .
( $ = 0.624 British Pounds ) Barclays Plc shares dived on Tuesday as the bank reported 1996 pretax profits at the lower end of expectations and a slump in its investment banking unit BZW.Barclays shares were down 55-1/2 pence at 1144p in afternoon trade , having hit a low of 1131p , after the news that pretax profits at the bank rose by 13 percent to 2.36 billion pounds ( $ 3.8 billion ) , including an exceptional 70 million pounds gain on disposals.The shares took a further tumble as analysts returning from meeting the company moved to downgrade the stock .
Analysts at SBC Warburg cut the stock to hold from buy , market sources said , and others were cautious on the outlook for the share.The profits were at the lower end of forecasts and included a 29 percent fall in operating profits at BZW to 204 million pounds.The company , which has repurchased over one billion pounds of shares in the last 18 months , said it would return 500 million pounds to shareholders in the next twelve months , and raised its dividend by 21 percent to 31.5 pence , in line with forecasts.But even the buy-back news failed to cheer the market.The basic message is that there was disappointment about the headline profits and dividend , the mix of profits and the potential size of any buyback , said Michael Lever , analyst at HSBC James Capel.The figures were disappointing relative to expectations and everyone will be pulling their numbers back .
I do n't think they will make much more in 1997 than they did in 1996.Market sources said estimates for Barclays pre-tax profit in 1997 were being trimmed by about 200 million pounds.Barclays chief executive Martin Taylor mounted a spirited defence of the results and his strategy at BZW , saying that the UK banking figures were cracking and that Barclays was investing for the future at BZW.You have to be careful not to be frightened by your own shadow , Taylor told Reuters in an interview .
The reason that the returns are depressed ( at BZW ) this year is that we 're spending so much.BZW chief executive Bill Harrison said he plans to improve links between BZW 's key areas to build profitable business .
He added that the bank 's markets division had needed a significant upgrade , but had now been re-tooled ... and is strongly placed to make a significant earnings contribution.In a statement earlier , Barclays admitted underperformance by BZW in the fixed income market , with the exception of sterling , and foreign exchange area.Taylor said BZW would continue to incur quite high costs in the first half of the current year and would then face the disruption of moving its offices to Canary Wharf in London 's Docklands.I would hope that the second half would be a lot better , he added.BZW has had had a turbulent time in the past year which started with the death of its chief executive David Band and has included high-level management shake-ups.On top of this , BZW has also been involved in what have been perceived as some high-profile disasters with its clients .
The biggest of these was its takeover defence for Northern Electric against U.S. energy group CE Electric which is being investigated by Britain 's Takeover Panel .
The late disclosure by BZW of a 250,000 sterling discretionary fee clause meant that CE 's offer was extended and it captured Northern by the slimmest of margins.But Taylor said that well-publicised events last year such as the Northern Electric defence had not done BZW damage.I think Northern Electric showed BZW behaving very energetically to try and prevent a client being taken over and almost succeeding , Taylor said .
We very nearly saved it.But the head of quity sales at another investment house said , The trials and tribulations at the investment banking arm look as if they will probably be continuing into the next year.Taylor said Barclays was looking for the best way to return the bank 's excess capital to shareholders but rejected the idea of a special dividend , saying that share repurchases help non-sellers to concentrate their position.He noted that earnings per share had risen by 25 percent to 104.2p per share.Taylor also rejected the notion that Barclays was devoid of ideas because it wanted to return capital.He said the bank would make acquisitions if they added to shareholder value but could see none on the horizon at the moment .
London-based international bank HSBC Holdings Plc sees 1997 as a challenging year amid increasing competition , its chief executive John Bond said on Monday.But Bond said HSBC 's strong capital position and balance sheet makes it feel as able to compete as anyone.We see 1997 as a challenging year wherever we look whether it be Asia or the UK , the competition continues to increase , Bond told Reuters in an interview.Earlier , HSBC announced a 23 percent rise in pretax profits for 1996 to 4.52 billion stg -- around the middle of market expectations -- and a hefty 9p rise in annual dividend to 41p which bettered most forecasts.Bond said the bank 's capital ratio 's were strong with tier one capital rising to 9.9 percent from 9.5 percent at the end of 1995 and said he did not see surplus capital being generated.As long as we 're making a respectable return on capital , we regard capital strength as an asset in our business , Bond said .
It helps you with the ratings , it helps with deposits in Asia and to have a strong capital position shows in the bottom line.HSBC had a 21.3 percent return on capital in 1996 compared to 20.7 percent in 1995.Bond said HSBC continues to be confident over the transition from British to Chinese rule of Hong Kong.Last year , HSBC was granted a license to trade in the Chinese yuan and Bond said the bank was in talks with the Chinese authorities to see how this would work in practise.Bond said HSBC was looking at this massive potential business opportunity in the long-term , I think it will take time , of course it will , but the signs are all positive.Bond said the rise of sterling against the dollar had not had a great effect on the group 's results in 1996 where the average rate for the pound against the dollar was below that of 1995.He said that , very roughly , for every cent the pound goes up against the dollar , the bank loses 13 million stg in profits.Bond said HSBC 's UK unit Midland Bank would continue to grow organically as the price of acquisitions was impossible to justify to shareholders.Bond said the unit had put in a strong performance with pretax profits up over twenty percent and costs controlled to a rise on less than one percent. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864 Northern Rock Building Society said on Monday that 900,000 of its members would get 500 free shares when the society floats on the stock exchange later this year.The estimated market price of the shares will be between 260p and 295p , valuing the society at a maximum of 1.3 billion pounds ( $ 2.1 billion ) .The value of the shares will be between 1,300 and 1,475 pounds based on a valuation by the society 's advisers J. P. Morgan .
The flotation day is expected to be October 1.The society has assets of 13.7 billion pounds and is the seventh largest in the country with roots going back to the 1850s.Adam Applegarth , Northern Rock executive director , said the society could remain independent and would grow organically .
We do n't plan to make any acquisitions , he said .
We have a good track record of organic growth and plan to take that forward.Draft legislation before parliament means that converting societies which make acquisitions in the financial sector will lose their five-year protection from takeover.The bill could become law before an election which must take place by May and is , in any case , supported by the Labour Party which is expected to form the next government.Applegarth said the new law would hit societies which had based their conversion strategy on growth by acquisition .
Those converters who have a strategy based on acquisition are going to find life a lot harder , he said in an interview.At a special general meeting to be held in the northeastern city of Newcastle upon Tyne on April 15 , 75 percent of investing members must vote in favour of the proposal for it to go forward while a simple majority is required from borrowing members.Newcastle-based Northern Rock said it would also pay a statutory cash bonus of around 8.8 percent of balances held in accounts on December 31 , 1996 to those members who are not entitled to vote including those under 18 years of age.Northern Rock confirmed it planned to set up a foundation to receive five percent of the company 's pretax profits which would have been the equivalent of eight million pounds in 1996.This money will be used to support charitable causes mainly , but not exclusively , in the northeast of England.The Northern Rock Foundation has been asked to pay a donation of one million pounds to disabled charities to compensate for the loss of benefit from the flotation to those disabled members who are second-named on accounts and do not get shares .
( $ = 0.615 British Pounds ) National Westminster Bank Plc on Tuesday reported a jump in operating profit but the bank 's shares dipped after it warned of an economic slowdown in 1998 and did not perform an expected share repurchase.Underlying profit rose by 27 percent and NatWest , one of Britain 's biggest banks , said the headline profits figure was hit by one-off items.Profit before tax was 1.12 billion pounds ( $ 1.8 billion ) after exceptional items , with operating profit from continuing operations up by 339 million to 1.61 billion pounds.The bank said it expected the pace of British economic growth to slow in 1998 , however , and as a consequence was adopting a more cautious approach to lending.We do n't want people to get carried away by 3.5 percent ( economic ) growth this year which is what me might still see , NatWest chief executive Derek Wanless told Reuters in an interview.Our belief is that whoever wins the election , rates will rise and the fiscal position could well be tighter.He added that NatWest was putting the lending policies in place now for people who will be paying back in that economic climate.Wanless said NatWest expected British base rates to rise to 7-1/4 percent by the end of the year compared to their current six percent level.NatWest increased its general provisions against bad debts by 50 million pounds and made specific provisions of 499 million pounds.Analysts said the market would be disappointed that NatWest had not performed a further repurchase of shares following its 451 million pounds buyback last July.Wanless said NatWest will perform further share repurchases if it generates more surplus capital.Some analysts had expected NatWest to use its remaining shareholder authority to buy back 28 million shares which would have cost it some 220 million pounds but the bank made no announcement.If we 've got surplus capital we will return it to shareholders , Wanless said .
That 's still the policy and will remain the policy.He said NatWest would ask shareholders to return its buy-back mandate to 100 million shares at its AGM in April but declined to give any clues on when a repurchase might actually be performed.NatWest 's pre-tax profit figure came after a loss of 719 million pounds on sale of businesses such as its U.S. banking operation Bancorp , costs of 186 million on the redesign of its UK retail bank and a gain of 224 million on the sale of its stake in venture capital company 3i.Pre-tax profits at NatWest Markets , its investment banking arm , rose to 462 million pounds from 304 million , although this included a fall in bad debt provisions to 18 million pounds from 114 million.Wanless said the group would not bid in the auction currently under way for mutually-owned life insurer Scottish Amicable but added that it was still on the look out to bolster its operations in the area of long-term savings.Wanless said NatWest UK saw a six percent rise in income and a two percent fall in costs despite the fact that it was spending large amounts on new systems.He said an additional 100 million pounds would be spent on this in 1997.NatWest is paying a final dividend of 19.4 pence , raising the total for the year by 14.6 percent to 29.0p.By 1130 GMT , NatWest shares were 25-1/2 pence lower at 787 having rallying from a low earlier of 762 .
( $ = 0.611 British Pounds ) Royal Bank of Scotland has seen its corporate and institutional banking ( CIB ) unit show good growth in recent years using a strategy which rejects any idea of competing in the increasingly crowded investment banking world.Its managing director Iain Robertson told Reuters in an interview that CIB now produces some 30 percent of the banks profits , a figure expected to rise to around 40 percent.We are not an investment bank and we 're not a securities house , Robertson said , and frankly , I do n't have the billion pounds that I would actually have to spend to become one , nor have I any desire to do so.Royal Bank 's strategy contrasts with some others which have been devoting large amounts of capital , investment and other resources in fully-fledged investment banking with , to say the least , questionable returns.Royal Bank 's success has been based on its traditional features which have been updated by Robertson who insists that it will persist along its current profitable line.CIB has seen those profits rise to 207 million stg last year from 43 million in 1991 and they are expected by analysts to rise again in the 1996/97 results to be announced soon.These figures produce a return of over 20 percent on risk adjusted equity -- highly respectable and a lot better than some higher profile investment banking operations.Since October 1 last year , Royal Bank has been running all of its corporate relationships , big and small in CIB whereas previously only large corporates , financial institutions and companies with a turnover of over 100 million stg , were grouped there.The transfer of small and medium corporates will immediately raise CIB 's share of profits of the group to 40 percent and Robertson sees this staying fairly stable given that the retail side will also grow.The move to bring in the small and medium corporate sectors into CIB stemmed from the fact that Royal Bank 's retail operation has developed a much stronger personal focus in the last few years and managers perceived that the smaller corporate customers no longer identified with the retail side.Robertson , a Glaswegian who came to Royal Bank after being deputy chief executive at County NatWest , the forerunner of NatWest Markets , is delighted that , in the homogenous world of modern banking , CIB has some unique features to offer.He said Royal Bank was well known among its clients for having probably the shortest management lines in the business and has brought in staff with a big diversity of experience outside banking.In areas like property , we have brought in professionals who know the terms and conditions of property investment -- what will stick and what will not stick.Robertson says he wanted CIB to be the leading independent provider of corporate banking services in the UK.We have no axe to grind in terms of providing equity or securities or anything else .
We will tell them what we think they can achieve in the debt markets and we 'll put our corporate reputation behind what we say , he added.CIB 's major business groupings are Treasury and Capital Markets including foreign exchange ; bond sales ; securitisation , Structured Finance , which includes syndicated loans ; project finance ; and credit trading and Risk Finance which includes acquisition finance and development capital and Trust Bank which is substantial investor services business.The group has main offices in Edinburgh and Manchester as well as London.Robertson said the bank wanted to develop its niche products outside the UK possibly with joint ventures such as that in project finance with Banco Santander in South America.Royal Bank has a high quality book of around $ 1.0 billion in the US but sees little opportunity for indigenous major growth.In the core business , he also sees the opportunity to grab market share from competitors by adopting the same strategy seen in its large corporate business of cross-selling products .
Britain 's big banks look set to raise profits by some two billion pounds in 1997 , taking the aggregate above 14 billion pounds ( $ 22.6 billion ) , but volume-based revenue growth could be storing up problems , analysts said on Thursday.The big six -- Lloyds TSB , Barclays , HSBC Holdings , National Westminster , Abbey National and Standard Chartered -- drove profits up to 12.6 billion pounds in 1996 from 10.8 billion in 1995 but analysts were still a little disappointed.John Aitken , banking analyst at UBS , expressed concern at a loss of momentum in underlying profit growth in the second half of 1996.Operating profit grew by an aggregate 17 percent in 1996 but there was a worrying loss of momentum in the second half which saw growth of only 12 percent , compared to 22.5 percent in the first , Aitken said.Aitken does not anticipate a similar dip in the first half of this year but expects the momentum to continue to be lost as banks see their margins under pressure in 1997.There will be downward pressure on underlying margins in 1997 but growth in higher-margin business such as credit cards and consumer finance will largely offset that , said David Poutney , banking analyst at Panmure Gordon.But , as Aitken noted , high-margin business has high margins for a reason -- it carries a higher risk , which is likely to result in an increase in bad debt charges in years to come.Also affecting margins in the second half of 1997 will be the end of a so-called deposits lock-in.Large amounts of money are currently tied up in accounts at four mutally-owned building societies which are floating on the stock exchange this year .
This has meant that banks and building societies have been able to pay lower rates for deposits because the market has been less competitive than normal.Faster loan growth of the last three years will also mean that bad debt charges will begin to edge higher this year.Analysts see even greater pressure on margins in 1998 when the lock-in effect is over.While many sectors would be keen to have the problems of the banks , the warning signs look to be building up.All the major components of the profit and loss account are headed the wrong way , Aitken said .
The only thing that is higher is volume growth and that carries both a capital cost and a potential risk cost.Some banks will show a sharp acceleration in pre-tax profit growth but their underlying performance will need watching , they said.NatWest , for example , could see profits rise to two billion pounds from 1.12 billion , the latter figure heavily affected by losses associated with its sale of Bancorp , analysts forecast.Abbey National will have a full-year contribution from National & amp ; Provincial , while Lloyds TSB is expected to continue its surge , said John Leonard of Salomon Brothers.Costs look to be fairly stable with certain major exceptions.Barclays and NatWest will continue to spend money on their investment banking operations , which still provide low relative returns , and Standard Chartered has signalled a major boost to its investment programme , widely welcomed by analysts.StanChart and HSBC , with their large Asia/Pacific region franchise , will continue to be dependent on those economies.Both continue to be relaxed about the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule .
The Hong Kong economy looks to be improving after a slowdown although problems in Thailand seem set to persist , analysts said.For the future , both banks are well placed for the potentially huge Chinese market .
But they are not letting market expectactions get out of control , Leonard added .
( $ = 0.620 British Pounds ) Martin Owen , under intense pressure as his NatWest Markets operation admitted a 90 million pound ( $ 144 million ) loss on derivatives trading , is at first glance an unlikely character to lead an investment bank with global aspirations.The investment banking unit of British banking giant National Westminster Bank plc is run by a friendly , talkative man with a soft Welsh accent who trained as an accountant and takes an active role in the Salvation Army.Doubts have persisted about NatWest 's investment banking strategy which has expanded aggressively in the last 18 months through several acquisitions which some analysts have criticised as too expensive.The big spending has included major expansion in the United States with the purchase of Greenwich Capital , a bond trading house , for $ 590 million and mergers and acquisitions specialist Gleacher for $ 135 million.But by all accounts , Owen , 49 , has made a good job of bringing the disparate parts of NatWest Markets together although , like its investment banking peers , this has meant a big rise in costs with more to come.Some market observers say Owen does have difficulty with the mergers and acquisitions side of the business.His background would support this view as Owen came to the top via NatWest 's treasury and capital markets operations.After working for American company Dow Corning Corp in Wales , Owen joined Welsh independent TV company HTV before starting his own accountancy and insurance business which he sold in 1979.Three years of full-time work for the Salvation Army followed although Owen did manage to squeeze in an external doctorate in , ironically enough , risk management from the University of Southern California.Thus qualified for the financial markets , Owen joined NatWest in 1983 only pausing for a short stint as a financial supervisor in the Isle of Man.Analysts do not doubt Owen 's ability to make the business bigger but they do question the wisdom of trying to emulate the big Wall Street investment banks.Even under 1996 's relatively favourable market conditions , NatWest Markets profits rose by 158 million pounds to 462 million .
But when a big 96 million drop in provisions is taken into account , the 62 million pounds left have been more than wiped out by the options loss.Owen , who has headed NatWest Markets since 1992 , appears genuinely shocked that the options problem could have begun as long ago as the end of 1994.That is clearly unacceptable against the background of incidents at other firms as well , Owen said on Thursday .
Fortunately it does seem to be isolated to this area.Some would say that fortune should not really come into the equation but at least these losses -- 77 million pounds after provisions and bonus cuts are taken into account -- are dwarfed by those posted by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell or Barings.Owen will perhaps sleep more soundly after NatWest Group chief executive Derek Wanless expressed his confidence in him.Wanless told Reuters in an interview that he had complete confidence in Owen , who will give up 200,000 pounds of a 500,000 pound bonus because of the options affair.It is a set-back for Martin in one area .
We 'll learn a lot from it , get those lessons put into practice and that will make us much stronger , Wanless said .
( $ = 0.626 British Pounds ) British insurance and financial services company Legal & amp ; General Plc on Thursday posted a larger-than-expected rise in operating profit to 134.3 million pounds ( $ 208.9 million ) after 111.1 million in the first half of last year.The insurer also weighed in with a 13.6 percent rise in its interim dividend to 8.75p per share after 7.7p last time.Legal & amp ; General said it could also benefit from the recent investment management problems at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management ( MGAM ) .Chief executive David Prosser told Reuters he did not expect the negative impact of the debacle at MGAM , a unit of Deutsche Bank , to be very great.I do n't think there will be much ( negative impact ) , Prosser said .
It 's a well-regulated market and IMRO will make sure investors do n't lose out.The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation has launched an enquiry into how investment funds at MGAM were managed following their temporary suspension last week after MGAM said it had found possible irregularities.Prosser added that Legal and General could actually benefit.We could have some benefit , Prosser said .
We are a strong company with a triple-A ( credit ) rating , one of the few life houses to have one.He added that , given Legal & amp ; General 's strong brand name , it could see some positive backlash from the affair.Prosser said the first half results had been achieved in a market which remains highly competitive.The strong increase in new business , especially in life and pensions income , enhances the group 's future profit potential.The company 's pre-tax profit was inflated to 1.51 billion pounds compared with 119.1 million last time by changes in reporting standards as required by a European Union directive.The figure for the first half of this year includes 1.402 billion pounds reclassified from its shareholders ' retained capital within its UK long-term fund.The operating result was at the high end of analysts ' forecasts and the dividend higher than expected and L & amp ; G shares stood 16.5 pence higher at 745p per share by 1000 GMT.Looking to the future , Prosser reiterated that growth by acquisition does not form part of Legal & amp ; General 's strategy.I would never say never but an acquisition is not part of the strategy , Prosser said.He said Legal & amp ; General 's strategy consists of organic growth from multi-channel selling approach which , in turn , is based on good value for money products and advice-based selling.The strategy is not dependent on buying anyone or merging with anyone , Prosser added.Prosser said second half trading had continued the good results but noted that the very good performance of the company 's bulk annuity business is unlikely to be repeated in the second six months.L & amp ; G said it would perform a five-for-two share split of its ordinary shares subject to shareholder approval , which a spokeman said was being done to aid market liquidity .
( $ 1=.6430 Pound ) - Chip designer Mosaid Technologies Inc will see earnings bounce back in fiscal 1998 as the chip market re-ignites , Chief Executive George Cwynar said on Wednesday.Cwynar told Reuters in an interview that he saw profit and revenue growth accelerating to the 20 percent range in fiscal 1998 from about two percent in fiscal 1997 ending April 30.This calendar year we 're in , is going to be a slow recovery year , he said.Mosaid last week reported that earnings per share for the third quarter ended January 31 fell to C $ 0.06 from year earlier C $ 0.32 due to the collapse in memory chip prices in the past year and delayed orders for chip testing systems .
Cwynarsaid he expected the memory chip market to come back in 1998 as personal computer users snapped up the backlog of cheap chips and increased demand for Mosaid 's bigger , faster designs.Analysts predicted that Mosaid , based in Carp , a town about 35 km ( 21.75 miles ) west of Ottawa , would recover from its recent slump , aided by ACCELERIX , a single component that would combine the functions of memory and logic.Mosaid spokeswoman Sue Rutherford said that up to five analysts planned to start coverage of Mosaid , which posted revenues of C $ 37 million in fiscal 1996.One analyst who declined to be identified said : All the ingredients are there for a big comeback.Mosaid increased its work in memory/logic design after acquiring a large stake in ACCELERIX Inc in October 1996 .
Cywnar said the ACCELERIX design could increase speed and cut space demands , making it ideal for portable products that are rapidly capturing buyers ' interest.We expect to have the design finished this spring sometime , said Cwynar , adding that Mosaid anticipated a production-ready design by the end of this calendar year.Mosaid shares were down 0.35 to 14.25 in late trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday .
( ( lydia.zajc @ reuters.com , Reuters Toronto Bureau ( 416 ) 941-8109 ) ) Toronto stocks gained nearly one percent on Wednesday , powered by a rally in the conglomerate and banking groups as investors cheered strong first quarter earnings.The Toronto Stock Exchange 's key 300 Composite Index climbed 55.27 points to close at 5789.82.Trading was moderate with turnover of 78.9 million shares worth C $ 1.27 billion ( $ 909 million ) .I think this surprised a few people , said ScotiaMcLeod senior vice-president Fred Ketchen .
The overriding influence in the market is moving away from inflationary problems to satisfaction with earnings , he said.Toronto and New York have corrected about 10 percent since mid-March amid fears of further U.S. interest rate hikes.But investors have put those concerns aside as companies report stronger-than-expected earnings , Ketchen said.Canadian steel maker Stelco Inc on Wednesday posted first quarter earnings of C $ 0.27 ( $ 0.19 ) a share compared to C $ 0.13 ( $ 0.09 ) a share in the same period a year ago.Of Toronto 's 14 sub-indices , 11 gained ground led by consumer products , banks and conglomerates .
The three weak sectors were media , real estate and golds.The expectation is that the banks are going to have another year of record earnings , Ketchen said.Advancing issues edged out declines 482 to 468 while another 285 stocks traded flat.In individual stocks , Bre-X Minerals Ltd. continued to attract attention , slipping 0.06 to 2.17 on 3.9 million shares .
Bre-X was the most-active stock of the session.Royal Bank of Canada , the country 's largest bank , jumped 1.20 to 53.05 on 2.8 million shares.Gold producer Placer Dome Inc. fell 0.35 to 23.05 on 1.6 million shares ahead of an announcement by Crystallex International Corp.Crystallex was expected to make an announcement regarding its effort to claim a part of Placer Dome 's Las Cristinas gold property in Venezuela , analysts said.Crystallex gained 0.81 to 4.01 before the stock was halted pending news on Wednesday .
Toronto 's key stock index set new highs on Wednesday , powered by glittering gold stocks as gold futures soared on precious metal markets.The Toronto Stock Exchange 's 300 Composite Index jumped 38.46 points to close at 6165.38 , its seventh record close of 1997 .
The index also set an intraday high of 6172.13.Trading was heavy with 119.6 million shares changing hands worth C $ 1.9 billion ( $ 1.4 billion ) .The gold sector , which makes up 10.5 percent of the key index , gained nearly 2.4 percent by the end of the session.April gold prices on COMEX turned around from their losing position to close $ 3.50 higher at $ 345.40.But Canada 's largest equities market was kept in check by unexpected losses in the heavyweight banking sector .
Investors decided to jump on the golds bandwagon and sell bank issues , take profits after the sector hit new heights this week.A little bit of the helium has escaped from that sector today , said ScotiaMcLeod 's senior vice-president Fred Ketchen .
Everything else 's showing strength , mirroring New York.All of Toronto 's 14 sub-indices rose except for banks and real estate .
Golds led the surge , followed by retail , utilities and consumer products.Advancing stocks raced ahead of declines 545 to 437 , while another 284 traded unchanged.Gold stocks were active , including Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp. , the world 's second largest gold miner.Bre-X President David Walsh said he was positive the prospector would reach an agreement with its Indonesian partners by the February 17 deadline , set by the Indonesian government .
This will allow Bre-X and Barrick to develop a huge gold discovery in Busang.Bre-X stock rose 0.45 to 22.70 while Barrick added 1.05 to reach 36.25 , both in heavy trading.Retailer Sears Canada Inc. topped Toronto 's most actives , rising 0.40 to 11.95 on 2.6 million shares.Automobile parts maker Magna International Inc. lost 1.45 to 71.35 on more than two million shares after an agressive U.S. seller shed a very large amount of stock .
Toronto stocks ended weaker in brisk turnover on Tuesday , pulled down by weakness on Wall Street and a tumbling financial sector.The Toronto Stock Exchange 's key 300 Composite Index lost 25.26 points to 6129.28 .
Trading was active as 106.6 million shares worth C $ 1.8 billion ( $ 1.3 billion ) changed hands.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58.92 points to 6896.56 and Canada 's banking group dropped almost one percent.Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels said Toronto 's market had traded in a narrow range recently as investors debated a possible hike in U.S. interest rates.Once rates go up , bond yields increase and bond prices drop , attracting investors who then sell interest-sensitive issues such as banks .
The bearish players believe rates will rise , while others think Canada 's key index will sustain only a temporary setback before resuming its upward march.I feel there has been a constant fight recently between the bulls and the bears , Meisels said .
He forecast Toronto would soon reverse its downward trend as investors hunted for bargains.Of Toronto 's 14 sub-indices , nine fell , led by consumer products , base metals , banks and transports .
Gaining groups included conglomerates , oils and golds.Declining stocks outnumbered advances 561 to 397 , while 299 traded unchanged.Among individual stocks , Wascana Energy Inc. topped Toronto actives after Tuesday 's news that Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd. said it planned a C $ 20.50 ( $ 14.97 ) a share all-cash bid for Wascana .
Wascana jumped 1.10 to 20.45 on 15.8 million shares and Canadian Occidental rose 1.70 to 25.15.Wascana was seeking a white knight after a hostile bid from Talisman Energy Inc.

Toronto stocks sank to their lowest level in four months on Friday after unexpectedly high U.S. producer price data heightened fears of further U.S. interest rate hikes.The Toronto Stock Exchange 's 300 Composite Index plunged 106.47 points , or 1.84 percent , to end at 5683.64.Nearly 88 million shares changed hands worth C $ 1.23 billion ( $ 879 million ) .People are finally doing a bit of panicking here , said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels.The key index closed at its lowest point since December 6 when it dipped to 5672.21 points.U.S .
producer prices slipped 0.1 percent in March , but the core rate , which excludes food and energy prices , jumped 0.4 percent .
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an average increase of 0.1 percent in the core rate.The data sparked fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates at a meeting in May , analysts said .

The selling was sparked by investor concern over the company 's financial liquidity after its failed merger with Avenor Inc. Toronto 's key stock index rocketed almost 100 points higher on Friday as earnings euphoria soared and fears of a U.S. interest rate hike waned.The Toronto Stock Exchange 's key 300 Composite Index climbed 97.01 points to 6106.91 and extended its winning streak to a fourth day.Trading in Canada 's largest equities market totaled 109 million shares worth C $ 2.2 billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) .All of a sudden people are coming back to rational expectations , said Calgary , Alberta-based portfolio manager Josef Schachter .
Earnings have been fantastic.Stock market gains in Toronto and New York were also powered by news of a long-awaited agreement between the White House and congressional Republican leaders to balance the U.S. budget , Schachter said.A balanced U.S. budget means the government will offer fewer bonds , boosting demand and prices for fixed income instruments and reducing yields.There were also growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not hike interest rates at its May 20 meeting since this week 's U.S. economic data pointed to minimal inflation growth.This week , Toronto 's key index jumped by almost five percent as strong corporate earnings rolled in.Of Toronto 's 14 sub-indices , 12 rose on Friday , including media , utilities , consumer products and banks .
Real estate and gold groups slipped.Advancing issues led decliners 616 to 358 , while 254 were unchanged.In individual issues , telecommunications conglomerate BCE Inc. jumped 4.20 to 69.95 .

Canadian grocery chain Loblaw Cos Ltd is set to see earnings per share soar by 50 percent by 2000 as sales grow , President Richard Currie said on Friday.Earnings per share will jump about 50 percent over the next three years , Currie told the annual meeting .
First- quarter profit rose to C $ 0.15 a share for the period ended March 22 from year earlier C $ 0.12.Currie also told shareholders that 1997 earnings per share would rise to C $ 0.85 to C $ 0.89 , the range of predictions by analysts .
My expectations are ( that ) the analysts are about correct , he said.Last year , Loblaw , which is 70 percent-owned by bakery group George Weston Ltd , earned C $ 0.72 a share or C $ 173.7 million on sales of C $ 9.85 billion.Currie forecast 1997 sales would expand by 10 percent .
Sales have been very solid , up seven percent last year , and with this year being a 53-week year , it might hit to 10 percent , Currie added .
That would represent a stellar year.Loblaw ended its previous fiscal year in December 28 but because it reports in 12-week increments , it must add a few days this year.The earnings have a potential to increase more if we can get our costs down to where they could be , Currie said .
In 1996 , Loblaw streamlined warehousing and distribution systems.Loblaw , which owns retail and wholesale stores including Loblaws , Valu-Mart , Extra Foods and Lucky Dollar Foods , has seen sales grow steadily over the past few years as it expanded in Atlantic Canada and other regions.The grocer plans to unveil its first Quebec stores , outside of its outlets in the Ottawa/Hull region , in late 1997 or early 1998.Loblaw has also benefited from the strike of unionized workers at 73 Safeway Inc stores in Alberta , which began on March 26 , Currie added .
Loblaw sales have jumped 30 percent in the province.Safeway is based in Pleasanton , California.Currie said Loblaw would have C $ 450 million in capital expenditures in 1997 , up from about C $ 350 million in 1996 .
He said Loblaw planned to open or renovate 64 outlets.Loblaw shares edged up 0.05 to 17.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange today , below its 52-week high of 17.60 and well above its year low of 10.40.George Weston shares rose 0.50 to 78 in Toronto .
( ( lydia.zajc @ reuters.com , Reuters Toronto Bureau ( 416 ) 941-8109 ) ) iStar internet inc 's new chief executive Craig Wallace said on Wednesday that the Internet service provider would post a reduced third-quarter loss on Friday , following a heavy second-quarter loss.Earnings will be in better shape than Q2 and will even be better in Q4 , Wallace told Reuters in an interview.iStar 's net losses widened to C $ 10.5 million or C $ 0.50 a share in the second quarter ended November 30 from a first-quarter loss of C $ 8.1 million or C $ 0.43 a share .
It did not give previous year comparisons because aquisitions changed the firm 's make-up.Wallace , who took the helm in January after joining the company last June , declined to elaborate .
Before moving to iStar he was director of marketing at Microsoft Canada Inc.Analysts and investors have been less optimistic .
One analyst , who declined to be identified , noted that iStar has not posted a profitable quarter since going public in November 1995 and said the performance could not get much worse.iStar 's shares have tumbled as low as 2.06 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after soaring to 22 at their opening in late 1995 .
On Wednesday they slipped 0.15 to 2.55.Last year iStar was busy snapping up Internet providers across Canada , but the company has now shifted its focus to providing Intranet software solutions for corporations.The Ottawa-based firm , which has about 65,000 personal and corporate subscribers across Canada , is now concentrating on growing revenue and containing costs , Wallace said.Soon after Wallace took over from founder Rainer Paduch , who became chief technology officer , iStar chopped about 20 percent of its staff , or 45 employees.The lay-offs cut C $ 500,000 from iStar 's monthly expenses and came on top of 100 layoffs last year.Wallace said revenue will rise but costs will fluctuate instead of increasing as iStar 's infrastructure is already in place .
We have significant improvement in our gross margin percent in Q3 and it will only get better in Q4 , he said , again declining to elaborate.He forecast that iStar will reach profitability in fiscal 1998.However , the analyst disagreed , citing a lack of credibility on the street .
It does n't really matter what their margins are , he said .
If they do manage to get their act together , it 'll be too late.Wallace said iStar is not actively seeking new acquisitions , but he would be willing to have discussions with any firm .
He dismissed past rumors that iStar might merge with rival HookUp Communication Corp.Wallace also brushed aside suggestions that iStar could be swallowed by larger companies , saying that he believed iStar would emerge on top from a consolidation in the industry .
( ( lydia.zajc @ reuters.com , Reuters Toronto Bureau ( 416 ) 941-8109 ) ) Toronto 's key stock index ended softer in light trading on Monday , depressed by weak gold shares and fears of a Canadian interest rate hike.The Toronto Stock Exchange 's 300 Composite Index eased 4.31 points to close at 5679.33 , down more than 10 percent since its life-time high of 6348.02 on March 11.Turnover was thin with 63.6 million shares changing hands worth C $ 965.6 million ( $ 689.7 million ) .The TSE was restrained on Monday by a weak Canadian dollar which prompted concerns that the Bank of Canada may have to raise Canadian rates to prop up the currency , said Dunnery Best , Midland Walwyn 's director of private client investing.Canada 's dollar closed at C $ 1.3994 ( US $ 0.7145 ) on Monday after the central bank intervened to support the sagging unit.In New York , the Dow Jones Industrial Average recouped some of Friday 's 148-point loss , rising 60.21 points to close at 6451.90 on Monday.Fears of rising U.S. interest rates , which dragged North American markets lower last week , appear to have subsided , Best said.Has it run its course ?
I would say largely , he said.Other stock analysts suggested the threat of higher U.S. rates is not over and they predicted the correction would resume.Of Toronto 's 14 sub-indices , nine weak groups were led by gold , consumer products and real estate .
Gainers included media , oils and base metals.Declining stocks outnumbered advances 581 to 351 with 290 unchanged.Hot stocks included Ballard Power Systems Inc. which jumped 3.25 to 39.50 after German industrial group Daimler-Benz AG said it bought a 25 percent stake in Ballard.The two companies plan to jointly develop fuel cells for electric vehicles.Among gold stocks , Bre-X Minerals Ltd. slipped 0.05 to 2.45 on 5.6 million shares , the heaviest trader on the TSE.Golden Rule Resources Ltd. fell 0.65 to 5.15 in heavy dealings .
Toronto stocks extended their winning streak to end higher on Thursday , powered by surging banks as fears of a Canadian interest rate hike eased.The Toronto Stock Exchange 's key 300 Composite Index rose 33.27 points to 6009.90 .
Trading was heavy at 95.3 million shares worth C $ 1.7 billion ( $ 1.2 billion ) .In the past three sessions , Canada 's largest market jumped by more than 2.5 percent.Banks led 12 of Toronto 's 14 sub-indices to higher ground , rising almost 1.8 percent as investors put aside worries that Canada would raise interest rates to match U.S. hikes.Investment advisor Ira Katzin with RBC Dominion Securities said : Financial services benefited from the expectations that interest rates would stay stable or ease off a bit.But market watchers were eying Friday 's U.S. employment data , Katzin said.The numbers could provide more indication of whether U.S. inflation was on the rise , which could prompt rate hikes by U.S. and Canadian central banks.The U.S. government will report April 's non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate.Toronto 's stronger sub-sectors included media , pipelines and real estate , while conglomerates and forestry products fell.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 500 to 447 and 301 were flat.In active issues , gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. lost 0.44 to 3.04 in heavy dealings .
Investors continued to consider the worth of its controversial Busang project in Indonesia.Royal Bank of Canada , the nation 's largest bank , rose 1.35 to 57.20 and third-ranked Bank of Montreal also rose 1.35 to 52.05 .
China 's financial markets breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday as the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping removed a major element of uncertainty that had overshadowed them for years , analysts said.The single most sensitive and volatile factor for the markets in and around China in recent years had been the health of Deng.Suddenly , it 's not there any more.The official announcement has finally removed the main disturbing factor in the markets for the past few years , said a Hong Kong stock analyst based in Shanghai.It 's the start of a new era .
The new focal point of concern will hopefully be more economic fundamentals , the analyst said.Local Chinese brokers agreed that Deng 's death late on Wednesday removed a key negative factor from the markets.His health has long loomed large on the markets , said one stock analyst in Shanghai.Bruce Richardson , Shanghai representative of HG Asia , said traders were relieved the wait was over.For years , people have been saying that when he goes there will be a deep drop which will present a buying opportunity .
I 'm a little surprised that the markets have digested the event so quickly , Richardson said.It shows that people are taking a forward-looking attitude .
sentiment is very positive all around , he added.Stock markets in China , Hong Kong and Taiwan moved higher on Thursday after gyrating wildly at the opening after the news.Hong Kong stocks had jumped 1.96 percent or 256.96 points , by midday after an initial loss of 92 points .
The weighted index in Taiwan rebounded from an earlier fall to close 21.19 points , or 0.28 percent , higher at 7,678.04.The Shanghai foreign currency B index was up 0.29 percent or 0.188 points at 65.318 while Shenzhen was up 0.63 percent or 0.89 points at 142.64.Some analysts have predicted a power struggle in the wake of Deng 's demise while others viewed the current leadership structure headed by Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin as being basically stable.China markets would now be looking for signs to indicate which group of pundits was correct , analysts said.The main concern is political instability , said a broker in Shenzhen .
People will be watching to see what measures the government takes over the next few days .
After an initial kneejerk fall in stock prices , China financial markets handled the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping calmly on Thursday , but analysts warned that trading could be volatile for some time to come.Some foreign brokers predicted strong buying by foreign investors over the coming days with the removal finally of the shadow of the Deng factor.Nearly all Shanghai 's shares opened in the morning at the 10 percent limit-down level with their Shenzhen counterparts also falling sharply on initial jitters over Deng 's death.But the markets quickly rebounded and by the end of trading , Shanghai 's domestic A share index was up 0.28 percent at 1007.731 points and the foreign currency B share index edging down 0.7 percent to 64.675 points.Shenzhen 's B share index ended up 1.26 percent to 143.53 points while the A share index lost 2.11 percent to 350.59 points.Alex Conroy , stock analyst with ING-Barings in Shanghai , said the sequence of a fall followed by a rebound in the aftermath of Deng 's death had long been expected , but the speed of the reaction was surprising.It 's happening a bit faster than I expected , she said.Brokers said prices were supported by widespread bargain hunting and heavy support-buying by domestic institutions.But they said investors would be watching Beijing for a clear indication that the final transition of political power to the next generation of leaders , led by Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin , was as smooth as most market analysts expect.On China 's largest state debt market in Shanghai , most treasury bill spot contracts ended up after an initial sharp loss with most investors expecting no big changes in policy despite Deng 's death , traders said.The foreign exchange market was unaffected by Deng 's death with the central bank firmly in control of price movements , traders said .
The Chinese yuan closed up at 8.2939 on Thursday from Wednesday 's 8.2945 against the U.S. dollar.China 's commodity futures markets were also untouched with technical factors dominating , traders said.Despite the first day 's calmness , we expect some volatile trading on thin volumes on the financial markets in the next few weeks , said a Chinese banker.The most important market stabiliser will be signs from the central government that the power transition is progressing smoothly , he added.Deng died late on Wednesday from respiratory failure .
He was 92 .
China is planning major reforms of its government debt markets in 1997 to make them more responsive to market forces and their rates more flexible , officials and analysts said on Tuesday.Reforms this year will focus on creating a more market-driven secondary market after a series of measures taken last year to improve the primary market , including the introduction of a public tender for setting coupons , they said.In a speech on this year 's plans for state debt markets , a senior official said reforms in 1997 will aim to improve coordination between the primary and secondary markets , the Shanghai Securities News said on Tuesday.We will actively strengthen the role of underwriters as market makers on the secondary market to promote the coordinated development of the primary and secondary markets , Deputy Finance Minister Liu Jibin was quoted as saying.Market makers -- major brokerages or securities houses -- would be required to invest consistently in the state debt market and help to stabilise prices when they fluctuate sharply , industry analysts said.A market maker system and off-floor trading will be introduced in 1997 , the newspaper on Monday quoted Gao Jian , director of the ministry 's state debt department , as saying.China began state debt issues in the early 1980s with purchases made compulsory for many people such as government employees and staff of state-run enterprises.By the early 1990s , purchases of government debt were voluntary , but state-run banks were still forced to underwrite whatever amount they were allocated by the authorities.Real market forces did not come into play until 1995 when Beijing for the first time used a public tender system to set the coupon rate on a debt issue.The system was used for all issues in 1996 -- an indication the primary market has been largely freed from administrative control , traders said.With the changes to the primary market now in place , reforms this year are expected to give more priority to the secondary market , said Lu Weiming , a state debt trader with China Guotai Securities.They are looking at reforms to the secondary market now largely because of the increasingly active trading there after three successive years of record debt issues , said a second trader.China issued a record 195.2 billion ( $ 23.52 billion ) yuan worth of state debt last year and industry sources expect this year 's issues to hit another record of 250 billion yuan.In other reforms , the People 's Bank of China at a meeting in Beijing last week ordered commercial banks to withdraw from trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets , traders said.The banks , which have accounted for more than 80 percent of the money supply on the repurchase market alone , have been ordered not to build any new positions and to gradually offset their existing positions.The state debt market will gradually move to being dominated by securities brokerages as a result of the withdrawal of the commercial banks , said a trader with J & amp ; A Securities.Other significant changes will include more issues of treasury notes and bonds which pay interest on an annual basis instead of on maturity , officials have said.The introduction of state debt paying annual interest will allow Beijing to one day open trading on the annual interest rate to pave the way for a possible start of financial derivatives , industry analysts said.China issued two experimental batches of state debt paying annual interest in 1996 .
( $ 1 = 8.3 yuan ) The Great Leap East in Shanghai real estate has begun with the property market in the Pudong zone beginning to look up thanks to official pressure on foreign banks to move over there , property analysts said.But the overall outlook for Shanghai 's office property market remains grim from the developer 's point of view -- vacancy rates are around 30 percent and likely to rise to 60 percent by the end of 1997 due to a forest of new buildings , the analysts said.Pudong 's Lujiazui district has been designated by the Chinese authorities as the future Wall Street of Asia.But the office space glut and transport difficulties have kept people away , until now.The great leap east is in progress , said Sam Crispin , senior manager with real estate firm First Pacific Davies in Shanghai.There 's been a rapid shift in interest with the banks moving over there .
The service sector will then follow , he said.Leading the leap to Pudong are the foreign banks which have been bluntly told by the Shanghai city government that they will not be able to do local currency business unless they put their headquarters in Pudong.Eight foreign banks have been given approval to do local yuan business in the past month , and they are busy setting up their Pudong operations , while other foreign banks with full branches in Shanghai are lobbying hard to gain the same privilege.Crispin said Lujiazui 's office vacancy rate was probably around 75 percent at present , and would probably remain at that figure for the rest of the year.I do n't see any significant decline by the end of this year because there 's significant amounts of stock coming onto the market , he said.James Hawkey , research manager for Jones Lang Wootton in Shanghai , said that while vacancy rates in Pudong were high , the take-up rate was accelerating.The vacancy rate ( in Pudong ) is currently 69.7 percent , but that 's to be expected for a newly-developed area , he said.There 's a lot of new supply in 1997 , but vacancy rates will probably start to move down , he said.With supply far in excess of demand for the foreseeable future , the analysts said they saw Shanghai real estate prices overall sliding further.The foreign banks are paying $ 20-24 per square metre per month for prime Pudong office space , compared to rates double that or more on the other side of the river in central Shanghai , analysts said.Rates ( in central Shanghai ) are likely to slide over the next couple of years .
They may come down to about $ 30 , but what the market is seeing now is that companies that want quality space are willing to pay for it , said First Pacific Davies 's Crispin.Another real estate broker said he saw the price floor for quality office space in Shanghai at somewhere close to $ 10-15 per square metre per month.The bottom of the pit is the limit , there 's too many buildings , the broker said .
But there 's still a shortage of really good properties .
China 's stock exchanges remain the most open and most market-driven financial markets in the country despite recent official pressure to rein them in , analysts said on Tuesday.The foreign exchange , interbank and treasury bill repurchase markets are kept under incredibly tight control by the Beijing authorities , with even tiny movements achieved only with official approval.Unlike the stock markets , the funds moving on the money markets are directly linked to China 's currency stability and money supply , said one interbank market trader.The central bank is afraid that any chaos on the markets could result in financial turmoil at either a national or local level , he added.China 's futures markets , once home to frenzied , casino-like trading , have been ruthlessly brought to heel over the past year with the authorities forcing speculative funds out to the stock markets , analysts said.Stocks are the most open of all China 's financial markets , said a stock analyst with a major Chinese brokerage .
There was the crackdown in late 1996 , but in fact the central government rarely intervenes in the markets.China 's stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen plunged in mid-December after the official People 's Daily published an article warning of over-heating .
Prices are now about 30 percent below their mid-December levels.Current rules allow for a maximum 10 percent rise or fall in a share price over one trading day , but information flow , while still behind the standards of advanced stock exchanges abroad , is relatively free , analysts said.On the nation 's interbank foreign exchange trading market , by contrast , the People 's Bank of China intervenes heavily on a daily basis to keep movements in the Chinese yuan against other currencies within very strict guidelines.The central bank has its own trading room on the market , which has access to all transaction details , while dealers from other players on the market can only see trades done by their own bank.Daily volumes are not posted on the market and rate movements of the Chinese yuan against other currencies are strictly limited , traders said.We feel very much that we are in an infair position with the central bank knowing everything and us knowing so little , said a Chinese foreign exchange trader.The tendency therefore is for us not to bother to think or analyse the markets too much .
Most of the trading is done in the dark with us just guessing at the central bank 's intentions , he added.Traders said the same situation existed on the Chinese yuan interbank market , launched just one year ago , and on the nation 's state debt repurchase markets.They said another factor was that the bulk of funds moving on the money markets were state assets.The central bank will not stand by and let them get lost in uncontrolled trading , said one trader .

The service sector will then follow , he said.Leading the leap to Pudong are the foreign banks which have been bluntly told by the Shanghai city government that they will not be able to do local currency business unless they put their headquarters in Pudong.Eight foreign banks have been given approval to do local yuan business in the past month , and they are busy setting up their Pudong operations , while other foreign banks with full branches in Shanghai are lobbying hard to gain the same privilege.Crispin said Lujiazui 's office vacancy rate was probably around 75 percent at present , and would probably remain at that figure for the rest of the year.I do n't see any significant decline by the end of this year because there 's significant amounts of stock coming onto the market , he said.James Hawkey , research manager for Jones Lang Wootton in Shanghai , said that while vacancy rates in Pudong were high , the take-up rate was accelerating.The vacancy rate ( in Pudong ) is currently 69.7 percent , but that 's to be expected for a newly-developed area , he said.There 's a lot of new supply in 1997 , but vacancy rates will probably start to move down , he said.With supply far in excess of demand for the foreseeable future , the analysts said they saw Shanghai real estate prices overall sliding further.The foreign banks are paying $ 20-24 per square metre per month for prime Pudong office space , compared to rates double that or more on the other side of the river in central Shanghai , analysts said.Rates ( in central Shanghai ) are likely to slide over the next couple of years .
They may come down to about $ 30 , but what the market is seeing now is that companies that want quality space are willing to pay for it , said First Pacific Davies 's Crispin.Another real estate broker said he saw the price floor for quality office space in Shanghai at somewhere close to $ 10-15 per square metre per month.The bottom of the pit is the limit , there 's too many buildings , the broker said .
But there 's still a shortage of really good properties.A Chinese real estate broker said grade A real estate in Pudong was already renting for around $ 15 per square metre per month.The overall occupancy rate is about 30-40 percent , although some of the better buildings are over 50 percent .
But it will be three to five years before Pudong property is really fully absorbed , the broker said .
China 's stock markets rose calmly on Tuesday reflecting signs of political stability seen since paramount leader Deng Xiaoping died last week , analysts said.Stocks rose in Hong Kong and fell in Taiwan , but for reasons that had little or nothing to do with politics in giant neighbour China , they said.Signs are clear during ( China 's ) six-day official mourning period ( from last Thursday to Tuesday ) that political conditions are stable , said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage in Shanghai.The markets expect no sensational political news to shake them , at least for a few weeks , he added.President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday offered unstinted praise for Deng during a funeral oration , saying the future lay with economic reforms pioneered by the strongman who died last Wednesday , aged 92.Modern China 's stock markets , established in 1990 under Deng 's direction , only officially emerged from an experimental phase last year , with many investors still worried that Beijing could decide to close them down , brokers say.With Deng 's death , investors are nervous about the continuity of policy , said the stock analyst .
Normal trading today serves to stabilise sentiment.Shanghai 's domestic A share index closed up 8.752 points , or 0.83 percent , at 1,063.83 while the foreign currency B share index ended up 0.589 points , or 0.9 percent , at 66.296.In sothern Shenzhen , the A share index rose 6.02 points , or 1.66 percent , to 368.7 points while the B index edged up 0.14 points , or 0.09 percent , to 150.87.A sense of stability dominated the markets today partly due to the normal trading ( hours ) , said a senior B share dealer .
This helped the indices move up.Trading on China 's two stock markets continued through the funeral ceremony for Deng in the morning , although volumes dropped significantly as traders and investors alike watched the live television broadcast.The central government wanted to tell millions of investors on the stock markets that they were determined to let the markets continue as before even though their creator is gone , said a stock analyst .
All markets closed up today , which shows they succeeded.Traders said share prices were likely to rise steadily for at least the next few weeks on strong national economic prospects.Technical factors will prevail in the coming weeks , said a broker .
Investors will buy blue-chip firms expected to post strong 1996 results .
They have confidence in the national economy this year after its good performance last year.In Hong Kong , share prices rallied on Tuesday , with the Hang Seng Index closing up 144.57 points , or 1.08 percent , at 13,520.26 mainly due to gains in HSBC Holdings.Brokers said China-related shares continued to attract keen interest and investors had been encouraged by Jiang 's vows to push ahead with market-oriented reforms.This morning Beijing reiterated the open-door policy will still be maintained , said Edwin Cheung , dealing director at Taiwan Securities.In Taipei , analysts said Deng 's funeral had no impact on stock trading , with the weighted index falling 21.25 points , or 0.27 percent , to 7,887.36.Nobody talked about it , said Allen Huang , fund manager for National Securities .
China 's first and only non-state bank , the China Minsheng Banking Corp , is planning major growth in 1997 but will always be a niche player beside the country 's huge state banks , a senior official said on Thursday.Minsheng was founded in Beijing a year ago , opened Shanghai and Guangzhou branches last month , and plans to open branches in at least six other Chinese cities over the next 12 months , Shanghai branch manager Lu Jiashan said.The plan is to set up branches in Shenzhen , Dalian , Hangzhou , Wuhan , Chengdu and either Qingdao or Jinan .
If it 's completed , the scale of the bank by the end of 1997 will be quite significant , Lu said in an interview.But he said the bank 's ambitious growth plans posed no threat to the state banks that dominate the country 's banking sector.We will grow fast , but we are in a weak position compared to the state banks , we 're no threat to them at all , he said .
The private banks will always be small players.The Minsheng Bank is an anomaly in China 's tightly controlled banking system.The bank does n't seem to quite rate the title private , but it has 59 shareholders , mostly private Chinese firms including the Hope Group , a feed grain producer based in Sichuan province , and the Xiamen Fuxun Group based in Fujian province.Lu said that the bank had complete freedom to make loans , in terms of both recipients and amounts , a huge difference from the state banks who have strict loan quotas they must stick to , and instructions on how much they must lend state enterprises.All our loans are based purely on commercial considerations , there are no quotas , no administrative interference in the loan process at all .
There are also no policy loan responsibilities , he said.Lu said the central bank viewed the Minsheng Bank as an experiment.Whether there will be more non-state banks or not is not for me to answer , but one thing we can be sure of is that there will be a lot more banks in China in the future , and many of them will be share-based companies , he said.The bank announced a small profit of 11 million yuan for its first year of operations and already has more than seven billion yuan in assets , Lu said.We have been open in Shanghai for only 18 days , but we already have assets of one billion yuan , which is much better than my expectations .
We have 150 to 160 enterprises that have opened accounts with us , he said.He said the bank 's target was to triple the assets of the Shanghai branch to three billion yuan by the end of 1997 and open several branch offices around the city.The bank 's main focus , he said , would eventually be loans to private companies , although at this point only 10 percent of its customers are private firms with state enterprises and listed companies making up the lion 's share.In the past , it has not been so easy for private firms to get banking support , Lu said .
Now there is a bank specialising in this sector , helping them with their businesses , which I am sure will give a boost to the economy as a whole.He said the branch had so far made 12 loans of which three were to private companies.There are risks involved , and we need to make the right choice of companies that will promote the market economy as a whole , so we do n't invest blindly , he said .
Foreign banks in Shanghai do not expect to start local Chinese yuan business for several months due to regulatory uncertainties and the requirement that they move operations to Pudong first , bankers said on Thursday.Four banks have been given approval to do local currency business , and the Business News reported on Thursday that other banks , starting with Hong Kong and European banks , will be added to the list during the year.For now , the four banks chosen to lead the experiment -- the Hongkong & amp ; Shanghai Banking Corp , Citibank , Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan -- are still largely in the dark , bankers said.It will take more time to organise , said a senior manager with one of the four banks .
The regulations issued so far are very general .
We need much more specific rules , and I 'm not sure they have even started to write them yet.The manager said he expected local currency business to begin by the middle of the year.The manager of a European bank waiting in the wings to enter local currency business said he thought the first trading would not come until at least March.In terms of the technical points it is now clear that the announcement ( on the foreign banks doing local currency business ) was premature , he said.He said the People 's Bank of China , the central bank , had made it clear that banks would not be allowed to start up until their main operations are physically located in the Pudong development zone across the river from central Shanghai.The requirement that the banks not only have an office registered in Pudong but also locate their main operations there , only made clear recently , has led to a sudden scramble for office space in Pudong , a real estate broker said.People have been charging over there , looking for places , while three months ago no one would touch it , the broker with a foreign real estate firm said.A senior manager with another of the four chosen banks said the requirement to move to Pudong was a major headache in getting local currency business going.Just working out the wiring in the Pudong office is taking a lot of time , this ca n't be done in one day , he said.Another key issue is the need to train up staff to handle the local business , the European bank manager said.Major foreign banks in Shanghai , currently restricted to doing business in foreign currency , have staff on training courses organised by the central bank to help them learn the procedures for local currency business , he said.But one of the bank managers said that beyond the technical issues , the major problem facing the foreign banks was one of how to get hold of enough Chinese yuan to lend out.The banks have been told they can basically only lend and borrow to foreign-invested enterprises registered in Shanghai , which generally speaking do not have large surpluses of Chinese yuan on hand , bankers say.Funding is going to be the major problem , said the bank manager .
Foreign business people said on Friday they expected Deng Xiaoping 's death to have almost no affect at all on either economic policies or the immense problems they face in making money in China.Analysts said foreign money had now become an indispensible part of the government 's efforts to keep unemployment down and the economy growing , and there was no prospect of any fundamental shift.Lance Browne , Standard Chartered Bank 's China manager , said he expected no change in policy toward foreign banks , nor in the speed and extent to which they can expand their business in China.It could hardly be any slower , and speeding it up , that 's unlikely too , he said.Business people at this point see virtually no impact on their operations , either with regard to policy or the problems they face , said a Western diplomat in Shanghai.Foreign businesses have been placed under ever-greater profit pressure in the past year as various preferential policies applied previously have been cut back or abolished to give domestic companies greater room to manoeuvre.There could be a further tightening of policy on the privileges applied , but that was going on before and has nothing to do with the death of Deng , the diplomat said.Deng , China 's paramount leader , died late on Wednesday aged 92.An American businessman in the automobile sector in Shanghai said he saw no impact from Deng 's death , but reported an increasing sense of concern among foreign business about the problems of getting approvals and making a profit in China.People are investing heavily , but there is a great sense of disappointment and unhappiness , he said.This has nothing to do with Deng , but it will be important to see how the leadership absorbs this , he said.Hoong Yik Luen , investment analyst with ING-Barings in Shanghai , said foreign funds had become a key part of government efforts to keep the economy growing and unemployment down.They would n't be able to change the policy on foreign investment , they could n't afford it , he said .
Unemployment would probably be 20 percent now instead of 15 percent if it was n't for foreign investment.An investment analyst based in Hong Kong said major foreign corporations were committed to investing in China almost regardless of what happens.The fact that there has been almost no impact on investment flows from the roll-back on the preferential policies shows how much momentum investment has , and there 's no reason for the Chinese to shift their policy on taking in money , the analyst said.I see no change at all in the short term , said Standard Chartered 's Lance Browne.There has n't been a sense that the reforms are controversial inside the leadership for years .
Had it been controversial , it would be different , he said.But Chinese officials appear to be concerned about the topic.One foreign businessman said he had been visited by officials asking for his view on the possible impact of Deng 's death on foreign investment in the country.They are asking the same questions you are asking -- what effect Deng 's death will have on investment decisions , the businessman , who declined to be named , said.I told them the feeling was that there would be no effect , he added.But of course it could be the calm before the storm .
We 'll have to see how strong the leadership looks in six months .
There are always people in the wings who would like to replace them , he said .
Business demands for cheaper telephone services will propel liberalisation in the telecommunications markets of the APEC region , a U.S. telecommunications official said on Friday.Larry Irving , a telecommunications adviser to U.S. President Bill Clinton , said the biggest advocates of change of telecommunications law were business leaders looking for better service and lower prices.The biggest proponent is not the telecom companies it is the industrialists , who are demanding better services and cheaper prices , said Irving , who is head administrator of the National Telecommunication Informational Agency ( NTIA ) .It is becoming a competitive edge , countries can not afford not to liberalise their telecom markets , Irving told Reuters at a meeting of APEC telecommunications ministers in Australia.Countries that liberalise telecommunications markets would create more telecom-related jobs than those retaining state-owned monopolies , he said , citing Chile , Mexico and New Zealand as APEC countries with open telecommunications markets.Irving said 400,000 jobs were created in the United States last year in telecommunications and information technology industry or about one-fifth of all new jobs in the U.S. economy.Chile 's Undersecretary of Communications Gregorio San Martin Ricci said more jobs have been created in his country 's telecommunications industry since the South American nation deregulated the market in the late 1980s.There are now nine companies providing local telephone services and six firms provide long distance calls , compared with two companies in the late 1980s , which has meant more jobs , San Martin told Reuters in an interview.A deregulated telecommunications market has also made Chile more internationally competitive , the Chilean minister said on the last day of the three-day meeting of ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) .Before our markets used to be so far away , because we are right down the bottom of South America , but with good telecommunications our customers are now very close and distance is no longer a problem , San Martin said.Fellow Latin American delegate , Carlos Mier Y Tieran , director general of Mexico 's telecommunications department , said his nation also took steps in the 1980s to deregulate its telecommunications market in order to become more competitive.There is no question that it has made us more competitive , but we realised we had to open it to private investment because we could not afford to do it ourselves , Mier Y Tieran said in an interview.Mier Y Tieran said about US $ 11 billion had been invested in Mexico 's telecommunications market over the past six years.In many ways Mexico has a geographical advantage , we are a neighbour to the biggest market in the world , the United States , we are part of APEC on the Pacific coast and Europe on the Atlantic side , and we are historically connected to the rest of Latin America , but to take advantage of this we need good infrastructure and if we do n't we will lose out , he said.APEC groups Australia , Brunei , Canada , Chile , China , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Japan , South Korea , Malaysia , Mexico , New Zealand , Papua New Guinea , the Philippines , Singapore , Taiwan , Thailand and the United States .
Muhammad Yunus may have the travel itinerary and packed schedule of an international banker , but that is where the comparisons stop.He does not wear a banker 's pinstripes , but the traditional , billowing Bangladeshi panjami .
He eschews five-star hotels and stays instead with friends and supporters around the world.Yet Yunus is Bangladesh 's most successful banker , a man who has gained international renown for doing the unthinkable.Yunus is head of Grameen Bank , which makes money out of lending money to some of the world 's poorest people .
Ninety-four percent of Grameen 's borrowers are women , and the bank makes loans to people with no collateral or credit rating.To the traditional banker this may sound like financial suicide , but Grameen has attracted more than two million customers since it started in 1976 and its lending philosophy has spread to over 50 countries.Yunus , founder and managing director of Grameen Bank , says his strategy works -- 98 percent of loans get repaid , a banker 's dream , and most borrowers escape from their poverty trap.Our goal is to take the poor people out of poverty as many ways as possible , Yunus said during a visit to Australia to meet Grameen supporter groups and politicans.Some of the world 's biggest bankers are now listening to Yunus 's cry against poverty .
The World Bank has appointed him chairman of its policy advisory group in its lending programmes to the poor.The world 's first Micro-Credit Summit , held last month in Washington , set out to ensure that 100 million of the world 's poorest families , especially women , receive credit by the year 2005 .
A large part of the credit programmes will be based on policies used by the Grameen Bank , which is 92 percent owned by its borrowers .
The rest is owned by the Bangladesh government.The formation two years ago of CGAP ( the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest ) , with the financial backing of the World Bank and European Commission , is an endorsement by the World Bank of Yunus 's vision.The CGAP has a budget of $ 291 million to set up micro-lending banks around the world .
Yunus wants to make sure all of this money reaches the people that need it and that it is not chewed up by bureaucracy.We are saying exactly $ 291 million should reach the hands of the poor people and you make the minimum out of service charges and we are suggesting a mechanism to do that , he said.Most of the aid money gets dried up in the servicing of the aid .
I am not blaming the bureaucracy itself .
I am simply saying the design is wrong , said the former economics professor.The world aid system also has its faults , Yunus said in an interview before a public lecture to a packed unversity audience.If he is not giving lectures in foreign countries he is receiving prizes or honorary degress and meeting supporters.Each year about $ 60 billion is given in aid by the World Bank and other government agencies , but these funds fail to meet their market -- the poor , Yunus said.This aid has been given to large infrastructure projects on the trickle-down economic theory rationale , but these do not create sustainable employment , said the U.S.-educated banker.Yunus ' idea for Grameen Bank came when he returned to newly-independent Bangladesh in 1972 to become head of the economics department at Chittagong University .
He found that the theories he was teaching were not working -- just outside the university walls people lived in squalor.Almost half of Bangladesh 's 112 million people live below the poverty line and about 68 percent of the population are illiterate.The 57-year-old banker knew that poverty was not due to laziness or lack of intelligence but a lack of capital needed for agriculture or industry.Grameen Bank now has a staff of 12,600 who visit 36,000 of Bangladesh 's 68,000 villages each week to meet their 2.1 million customers .
In 1996 the bank loaned about $ 400 million with the average loan at $ 150 .
The bank has two loans -- a one-year self employment loan and a 10-year housing loan.It ( capital ) is a very important part of alleviating poverty , but it is not the only one , said Yunus , who has been mentioned as a possible future Nobel Peace Prize winner.But other pieces become easier to fit in when you have created this centrepiece , then you can add the health piece , you can add education , said Yunus , who also plans to provide health care insurance , solar heating and cellular telephone services to Grameen customers.Our goal is to get these 2.1 million families out of poverty in the next five years in Bangladesh , Yunus said.Worldwide we shall look for a day when all the poor people are out of poverty ...
If it can be done in Bangladesh with 2.1 million families , it can be done worldwide .
It is just a question of will .
Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd , expected to report a sharp fall in half year profit on Wednesday , is shopping around for a new chief executive just as retailing conditions are expected to turn for the better.Analysts said Chris Tideman who resigned as CEO on Tuesday was the victim of a weak retail environment at a time when David Jones was spending more on opening new stores and restructuring.David Jones has disappointed investors since it listed in November 1995 with its failure to match prospectus forecasts .
I think the cycle worked against them , a Melbourne retailing analyst said.They have underperformed the cycle and that is a bit of a shame .
That reflects the costs of the new store openings.Analysts said Tideman may have been trying to do too much at one time .
David Jones was introducing new systems to manage its inventory as well as increasing its range of private label merchandise and restructuring its buying department.The retailer had also restructured its South Australian operations and announced plans to expand into Western Australia and New Zealand .
They have committed themselves to a lot of new stores and so far the new stores they have opened up ... are loss making and they have committed themselves to other new stores so their cost structure is a bit pumped up , said Simon Shakesheff a retail analyst at Macquarie Equities.David Jones ' share price has hardly been above its A $ 2.00 issue price since the float .
The group is due to release its results for the 26 weeks to January 25 on Wednesday.In January , the retailer said it expected its results to be up to 50 percent down on a year ago .
Tideman cited personal reasons for leaving and the company said he would return to Britain.Analysts expect David Jones to report a net profit before abnormals of between A $ 20 million and A $ 22 million.The dividend is expected to be about three cents a share for the 1996/97 first half.David Jones reported a net profit before abnormals of A $ 44.2 million for the 1995/96 first half and a dividend of six cents a share .
Analysts estimate the full 1996/97 year result to be between A $ 34 million and A $ 38 million .
The retailer reported a net profit of A $ 67.53 million in the 1995/96 year , which was up on the 1995 prospectus forecast of A $ 64.6 million , but its 1995/96 sales were below forecasts.Analysts were mixed about the outlook .
Some said the new chief had a tough job ahead due to re-invigorated Coles Myer Ltd owned Grace Bros-Myer department stores and the entry into the local market by Britain 's Marks & amp ; Spencer.But other analysts said Australia 's retail outlook for 1997 had improved and that the restructuring of David Jones was almost complete , meaning the new chief should not have as bumpy a ride as Tideman since he joined the group in 1994 .
It could be a dream job , coming in at the bottom of the cycle and six months away from full systems implemention , said John Burgess , a retail analyst at Pru-Bache Securities.We have had two bad Christmases in 1995 and 1996 , Burgess said .
You will reach the bottom of the spending cycle in the next two quarters , so you have spending on the rise , albeit slowly , towards the end of 1997 , he said.Analysts said David Jones may even announce the new chief executive on Wednesday .
Investors reacted positively to Tideman 's exit , pushing up the shares by three cents to A $ 1.74 .
About 1.21 million shares had traded by 2.15 p.m. ( 0315 GMT ) .

Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd reported on Wednesday a 50 percent fall in net profit for the 1996/97 first half and said it expected to make the appointment of its new chief executive officer ( CEO ) soon.David Jones , which is currently without a chief following the resignation of Chris Tideman on Monday , reported a net profit of A $ 22.34 million in the 26 weeks ended January 25 , compared with a net profit of A $ 44.64 million a year ago.The retailer also said the 1996/97 year net profit would be lower than the previous year .
Chairman Richard Warburton said the retailer would also review five or six of its underperperforming stores , but would not say if that meant store closures , but added that David Jones was also committed to its store expansion programme.Tideman , who joined the company in 1994 , made a surprise resignation on Monday , citing personal reasons.Responding to reports that there was shareholder pressure on Tideman to resign , Warburton said Tideman left of his own will and that there was no pressure from the board or shareholders .
Tideman oversaw the refloat of David Jones in November 1995 from the corporate remains of the debt-laden Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd , which cash-starved David Jones for most of the latter part of its 15-year ownership tenure.We expect to make an annoucement within days , not weeks , Warburton said about the chief executive appointment.Warburton said the half year results were helped by a good January , but described the result as disappointing.February saw a bit of a correction from the January upturn , but we have seen a slight increase in March , Warburton said .
Over the balance of the year , the company will continue to focus on implementing initiatives in product , consumer service and systems , the company said in the results statement.However , at this stage it is anticipated that the profit before tax level in the second half will be below the same period last year , the company said.David Jones warned in early January that its first half profit would be up to 50 percent below forecast due to a lacklustre retail trading environment .
Warburton said today the company did not expect any material improvement in retail trading conditions in the second half , adding that three reductions in official interest rates in 1996 had yet to filter through to the retailing sector.Finance director Robert Wright said today David Jones ' 1996/97 profit would be within analysts forecasts of between A $ 32 million and A $ 37 million.David Jones sales fell one percent to A $ 782.58 million in the 1996/97 first half .
Warburton said the retailer would review about five or six of its 30 stores department stores which were underperforming and not returing any shareholder vale.He said about one-third of David Jones stores were performing very well , another third were making a profit , but could be improved , while the final third were underperforming and not returning any shareholder value.You have got a final third that 's just not producing shareholder value .
They are not necessarily losing money but they are not increasing shareholder value , he said .
Out of that third a half , I believe , with a bit of hard work and creative juices could take them above the line , the other half we have to look at very , very closely.So you can see we have about five or six stores to look at , that does not necessarily mean closure .
It may mean you have to look at different things to do with those stores , he said.At 2.50 p.m. ( 0350 GMT ) , David Jones shares were two cents lower at A $ 1.72 with 487,292 shares traded. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 Seven Network Ltd chairman Kerry Stokes said on Wednesday that Seven would probably sell pay-tv firm Optus Vision to an international phone company if it was successful in litigation against Optus Vision shareholders.Seven claims in its court action that fellow shareholders in Optus Vision had breached the Optus Vision shareholders ' agreement .
Seven , a two percent shareholder in Optus Vision , has said successful litigation would mean it would be allowed to acquire Optus Vision at a discount to its full valuation .
We are talking to some international companies , mainly telecommunications and informational technology companies , Stokes told Reuters in a telephone interview.Stokes , who owns about 20 percent of Seven , said Seven would have 12 months in which it would be required to sell Optus Vision , which is spending A $ 3 billion on a fibre optic cable network around Australia carrying pay TV and telephone services.Stokes said there was more interest from companies in using the Optus Vision assets for telephone services than for pay TV.He added that none of the firms he had spoken to have any existing interest in Australia 's pay television industry .
On Monday , Seven said it had two offers to buy the rest of Optus Vision , one for A $ 648.74 million and the other for A $ 533.80 million .
It said it had 10 days to consider and respond to the offers.Asked if Seven would pay anymore than the A $ 648.74 million offer , Stokes replied : No , we wo n't have to .
He said that under the shareholder agreement , the Optus Vision shareholders would be required to sell at those prices.Australia 's telecommunications industry is to be fully deregulated on July 1 .
Stokes said there had been a lot of interest in the Optus Vision assets.You would n't be able to build that kind of infrastructure for the prices we will be able to get it at , Stokes said.Other Optus Vision shareholders involved in the battle with Seven are Optus Communications Pty Ltd and U.S. West unit Continental CableVision , each of which own 46.5 percent , and Kerry Packer 's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd , which has a five percent stake in the pay TV group.Ligitation between Seven and the other Optus shareholders is to be heard in the New South Wales Supreme Court on February 24 .
Optus Communications is 25 percent owned by Mayne Nickless Ltd .
The balance is owned by Australian institutions.Seven earlier on Wednesday reported a 31.5 percent drop in net profit in the 26 weeks to December 28 as the company started to account for income tax after exhausting its tax credits from operating losses racked up by previous owners.Seven is also 15 percent owned by News Corp Ltd , which owns 50 percent of pay television network Foxtel , which is a rival to Optus Vision.Shares in Seven closed five cents up at A $ 4.18 on Wednesday. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 APEC ministers agreed on Friday to further trade and investment liberalisation in the telecommunications sector , but recognised they can not drag China into the forum 's agenda of trade liberalisation.There has been an agreement by all economies to adopt the strategy of going towards open trade and liberalisation in trade in telecommunications , Australian Telecommunications Minister Richard Alston told reporters.Alston , who hosted the second Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) ministerial meeting on telecommunications and the information industry , said APEC could not push member countries to conform to a uniform policy.It is not a regional government .
It is not intended to drag unwilling players along a path that the majority thinks desirable , Alston said when asked about reports that China was reluctant to adopt telecom liberalisation.Whilst there might be some domestic reservations about particular aspects , the overall guiding principles are well recognised .
You simply do n't find a member economy that does not espouse the principles of the reforms in this area , he said.Alston said China was connecting 15 million telephone lines a year but still had one of the lowest penetration rates of fixed telephone lines among the 18 APEC nations.The challenges and the enormity of scale of operations of that country can hardly be compared to countries such as PNG ( Papua New Guinea ) and Brunei ... and so that is why you would have to allow for different views , he said at the end of the three-day meeting.Alston said he was hopeful Malaysia , the only member of the forum not to attend , would be at future meetings .
Malaysia also did not attend the initial APEC telecommunications ministers meeting in Seoul in 1995.We would all hope Malaysia will over time see the benefits that derive from collective discussions , Alston said.Although there were no tangible projects from the meeting , ministers agreed on further collaboration on working groups to look at telecommunications for rural development , distance education , information sharing and the environment.It would be very short-sighted if we simply committed ourselves to physical rollout without taking into account the effect on the natural environment , Alston said.Rapid technological change has brought new challenges such as dealing with the acceptance of electronic commerce and the taxation issues that go with it , he said.Undoubtedly , there will be a reluctance to fully embrace electronic commerce and all of its manifestations until we do solve problems of privacy , Alston said.He said he expected electronic commerce to be a growing industry once encryption and security issues had been resolved , but taxation issues will start become more important.It has n't yet reached the stage of being an avalanche of siphoning off the revenue from the taxation authorities , but it clearly has some potential in that regard and I think all member economies are aware of the need to handle the issue , he said.The next telecom ministers ' meeting is set for Singapore in mid-1998 .

The Australian government appointed stockbrokers on Thursday to manage the proposed sharemarket float of its telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp , which will be the nation 's largest privatisation.The float is estimated to raise a minimum of A $ 8.0 billion ( US $ 6.32 billion ) -- and perhaps much more.Finance Minister John Fahey said he wanted the Telstra float , through the sale of a third of the government 's 100-percent stake , to go through by the end of the year.I want it ready to go to the market this year , this calendar year , Fahey told reporters.But I am not saying it will , he said .
He added it was unclear whether the float of other international telephone companies would affect the float timing .
France Telecom and Italy 's state-owned Stet are also planned for sale this year.Australian brokers J.B Were & amp ; Son , U.S.-based CS First Boston and European based ABN AMRO/Rothschild had been appointed global co-ordinators for the float , Fahey said.He said J.B Were , Ord Minnett of Australia , CS First Boston , U.S.-Australian consortium Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank , Daiwa of Japan , ABN AMRO/Rothschild and German owned Deutsche Morgan Grenfell were appointed joint lead managers.The float would not be underwritten in Australia , where 65 percent of the offer is to be sold .
But the shares offered in the United States would be underwritten and listed on the New York Stock Exchange , the minister said.Two percent of the offer is set aside for Telstra employees and foreign investors are entitled to 35 percent.Fahey would not comment on how much the government expects to raise from the partial sale of Telstra .
I want to get optimum value for taxpayers of Australia , Fahey said.Australia 's Liberal-National Party coalition government was elected just over a year ago promsing to sell one-third of Telstra , with A $ 1.0 billion of the sale proceeds going to set up an environment fund.The float of Telstra will far exceed other privatisations by the Australian government in recent years .
The sale of Commonwealth Bank of Australia raised a total of A $ 8.0 billion , in two separate tranches , and the 1995 float of Qantas Airways Ltd raised A $ 1.45 billion.The announcement was a boon to Australia 's stockbroking community whose Christmas bonuses will be swelled by the Telstra float .
The bidding for the Telstra deal was contested by 30 broking firms , which were invited to lodge proposals .
( A $ 1 =US $ .79 ) Australian television broadcaster Seven Network Ltd said on Monday the advertising market was fairly tough but the group was meeting its budget targets.It 's a fairly tough market but we are going all right .
We are on track for our budgets , Seven managing director Gary Rice told Reuters in a telephone interview.Seven , which is 15 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd , reported a jump in net profit to A $ 115.13 million in the year to June 30 from A $ 41.26 million in 1994/95.Last year 's result was hit by an advertising rate bungle .
Rice described the 1995/96 year result as satisfactory .
But Rice said it was too earlier to forecast earnings for 1996/97 .
He said there was unlikely to be much of an impact from its Australian broadcast rights to the Atlanta Olympics in July.There is no short term gain or advertising dollars from an event like the Olympics , Rice said.Seven has focussed on building up its news and current affairs programming over the past year , which should increase costs , but also increase revenue.I have said that would have a net impact on costs , he said .
Asked if the costs associated with the news and current affairs programming initiatives had cut into margins , Rice repiled : Not substantially , because it has also had a revenue benefit.Seven , which is also 20 percent owned by its chairman Kerry Stokes , reported a 15.2 percent rise in sales to A $ 671.15 million in 1995/96.In July , Seven teamed up , in a surprise move , with United States billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian to back a management buyout of Hollywood film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc ( MGM ) for US $ 1.3 billion from French bank Credit Lyonnais .
Rice said there would be nothing in the short term coming out from Seven 's link to MGM , but in a few years there may be some joint efforts .
I think you will see down the track some joint promotion and the marketing of certain things.There will probably minimal returns out of MGM in the short term , but it is not a major cost in terms of potential payback , Rice said.Hopefully from a shareholder point of view , you will see some benefits flowing to Seven as we go down the track .
We are looking at three or four years before we get maximum benefit from MGM , he said .
Rice said the company had made not a decision yet about exercising its option in Optus Vision , which would increase its stake in the pay television and telephony group to 15 percent from two percent.We do n't have a view one way or the other , we do n't have to make a decision until then , we do n't have enough information at the moment , Rice said.Seven shares closed six cents lower at A $ 3.75 on low volume. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800 Tabcorp Holdings Ltd managing director Ross Wilson said the betting agency and gaming group was on track to meet its forecasts for the 1996/97 year and was eyeing the New South Wales ( NSW ) Totalisator Agency Board ( TAB ) .Typically , you have a slight downturn in the second half , because you have n't got the Spring Carnival , Wilson told Reuters in a telephone interview .
But certainly we are still looking okay and on track for our forecasts for the year.Tabcorp earlier reported a 17.5 percent rise in net profit to A $ 51.21 million in the six months ended December 31 , 1997 .
Wilson said January and February are up on the same period a year earlier but were down on the November and December period.You always have a downturn in gaming in January , February and March as people flock to the beaches and it has happened again this year , said Wilson from Tabcorp 's head office in Melbourne.Tabcorp , which was floated by the state government of Victoria in 1994 , reported a net profit of A $ 87.17 million in the year to June 30 , 1996.He said Tabcorp has a strong balance sheet to fund any major acquisitions and maintain high dividend payouts .
We have no debt , we have about A $ 90 million in cash and the business is a strong cash flow business so with a balance sheet like that you have significant funding capacity , Wilsons said.Wilson said Tabcorp had a market capitialisation of A $ 1.8 billion and shareholders funds of A $ 800 million.He said the group was interested if the NSW government decided to sell its TAB betting business .
The Labor government in NSW has yet to say publicly whether it would privatise the TAB , but it is expected to announce plans to sell this year.Obviously if the terms were right we would be very interested being involved in it , he said .
Wilson said Tabcorp would also be interested in any privatisation by the Queensland government of its TAB business.Queensland , New South Wales and Victoria are Australia 's three major racing states .
He said he did not expect any slowing in the growth rate of Australia 's booming gaming industry.Whilst we have had significant growth over the last few years , both nationally and in Victoria , we see that growth being maintained , with compound growth of 10 percent plus through to at least 2000 , he said.However , he said there would be some effect from the opening of the permanment Crown Ltd casino later this year .
There is no doubt that when you have a brand new venue like the casino opening up and it is very large it will attract a lot of lookers ... and it might have some initial impact but we do n't think it will have any long term impact , Wilson said.The A $ 1.6 billion Crown casino complex is expected to open in Melbourne around April-May.Tabcorp surprised the sharemarket last year with a special dividend of 12 cents a share for the 1995/96 second half on top of a 10 cents a share final dividend.Wilson did not rule out another special dividend in the 1996/97 year .
We closed last year with A $ 110 million in cash , we paid something like A $ 66 million in this last period and ... I always said we are happy to pay out a high dividend pay out ratio based on our cash flow forecasts , Wilson said.Then clearly if opportunities do not arise , then we are happy to continue the high pay out ratios , he said.Tabcorp raised its first half dividend to 11 cents a share in the first half , up from nine cents a year earlier.Tabcorp shares ended six cents lower at A $ 6.02. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 Confusion mounted on Monday when British electricity company Northern Electric 's fight against a hostile takeover from the U.S. prompted the Takeover Panel watchdog to launch an inquiry into the bid.Just one day before a new bid deadline , the Takeover Panel said it was investigating the circumstances in which it had received information from Northern 's advisers during the 782 million pound ( $ 1.3 billion ) bid by America 's CE Electric.Following the investigation , the executive will consider what , if any , further action is appropriate , it stated.The role of Northern 's adviser , investment bank BZW , has been under scrutiny since it failed to disclose until last Friday a 250,000 pound payment from Northern for its services in addition to its 1.5 million pound fixed fee.BZW has denied any wrongdoing .
A spokesman told Reuters : We have absolutely nothing to hide from an investigation and we expect to be fully exonerated.But asked whether the investigation may last into the New Year , the spokesman added : I would think so , yes.The Panel noted that it may also look into the acquisition by BZW and investment bank Schroders of 2.32 percent of Northern Electric 's shares last week.Although U.S. energy group CE Electric complained about the share purchases , the Panel cleared the deals last week .
Advisers are allowed to buy shares under British takeover rules despite the move being aimed at defeating takeover bids.Newcastle-based Northern Electric 's independence has been on a knife-edge since last Friday , when the bid timetable ticked to a close and CE Electric , which is controlled by energy utility CalElergy , fell fractionally short of winning control.But in an unusual twist , the Takeover Panel decided to extend the bid until 1300 GMT Tuesday for unspecified reasons.Gallingly for Northern Electric , CE Electric had by Monday boosted shareholder acceptances for its bid to just over the 50 percent mark needed for victory from 49.77 percent on Friday.Consequently , Northern Electric launched an appeal on Monday into the decision to extend the bid deadline and requested that its shares be temporarily suspended.Immediate details were unavailable about whether the Takeover Panel 's decision to investigate the bid indicated that it was willing to reconsider its decision to extend the offer -- or may allow late bid acceptances.We are not able to clarify anything at the moment , a spokeswoman said , adding that comments would be available in due course.CE Electric officials declined to comment .
Northern , which says institutional investors including the Prudential , Foreign & amp ; Colonial and M & amp ; G support the board , said it was awaiting the Panel ruling more in ignorance rather than in confusion.We are in uncharted territory , a spokesman told Reuters , adding that it remained unclear whether the Panel had decided to allow Northern 's appeal or not.Meanwhile , Northern 's shares have stopped trading at 638 pence , 12 pence short of the 650-pence-per-share that CE Electric is offering for control of the electricity company.It is the second time that Northern 's fate hangs in the balance since it was privatised along with its 11 regional electricity company ( REC ) peers in 1990.It was the first of the cash-rich RECs to face a takeover in 1994 and became the only one to successfully fight off , partly with the help of an extraordinary 560 million pound defence package , a bid by conglomerate Trafalgar House , now owned by Norway 's Kvaerner.Three U.S. utilities , attracted by Britain 's regulatory regime that curbs prices rather than profits , have already snapped up RECs .
Two other bids have yet to be completed.If CE Electric wins control of Northern , only two of the 12 original RECs will remain independent -- Yorkshire Electricity Group and Southern Electric .
( $ 1=.5973 Pound ) Dixons Group Plc became the latest British retailer to report a boost in Christmas sales on Wednesday but market watchers said there was no 1980s-style boom as discriminating buyers kept shops competitive.There is n't a big consumer boom but there is growth in the consumer economy , Dixons managing director John Clare told Reuters as the electronic goods firm reported sales up eight percent in the period over Christmas.There is certainly a return to the feel good ' factor , but it is n't a return to the spend , spend , spend culture of the eighties , said Clive Vaughan , retail consultant at research group Verdict.Analysts pointed out that as Christmas fell on a Wednesday in 1996 , many shoppers left purchases to the last minute and retailers were likely to have seen a late flurry of buying.At the same time , consumers are more discerning than in past years , preferring to pay for quality and investing in durables , which has favoured the higher end of the retail sector.Consumers are more discerning , so the high street is still very competitive on price and quality , said Hugh Clark of the British Retail Consortium , which represents over 90 percent of retailers and will release its December sales figures next week.British money supply data released on Monday showed a higher than expected increase in December month-on-month figures , suggesting continuing buoyancy on the high street , analysts said.Leading British department store Harrods , kicking off its January sale , said on Wednesday sales during the Christmas period were up 10 percent and two percent ahead of budget.It was a very strong , very consistent Christmas , said Michael Cole , Harrods director of public affairs.On the Monday before Christmas , Harrods had sales of three million pounds ( $ 5 million ) , compared with average daily intake of 1.2 to 1.5 million , he said , record Monday takings for the group.Meanwhile , Merchant Retail Group said on Wednesday its specialist Perfume Shop chain saw same store sales soar 18.6 percent in the Christmas period.Department store chain John Lewis said last week that sales in the week ending December 28 were up 8.8 percent on a year ago , while jewellers Goldsmiths said sales from existing stores jumped 9.8 percent in the Christmas period.Aspreys , jewellers to the Royal Family , told a newspaper last week that Christmas sales had been substantially better than last year , a double-digit increase.Clothing retailer Next Plc is expected to report Christmas sales by mid-January but analysts pointed out that its strong brand image should bolster performance.Indications are that the polarisation of stronger versus weaker retailers continues , said Roy Maconochie , analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite .
The consumer is more discriminating so stronger brands win out , Verdict 's Vaughan said consumer demographics were also influencing product sales as the youthful buyers of the eighties become the more cautious over-30-year-old consumers of the nineties and have more disposable income .
( $ 1=.5922 Pound ) The fate of an acrimonious battle for British utility Northern Electric was still in the balance on Saturday after the panel supervising a bid by U.S. predator CE Electric extended its offer until Tuesday.The outcome of the bitterly fought two-month contest had been expected by midnight on Friday , eleven hours after CE 's deadline for investors to accept its 782 million pound ( $ 1.30 billion ) offer.But a brief statement by CE 's advisors said that following a full hearing of Britain 's takover panel the 650 pence a share offer was being extended until 1300 GMT on Christmas Eve.Officials at the Takeover Panel declined to comment , but the Financial Times reported in its Saturday editions that the watchdog had effectively stopped the clock amid allegations of irregularities in the conduct of the bid.The paper said it was beleived CE Electric , which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the United States , had been close to declaring victory when the takeover panel launched a late-night inquiry into the allegations.The nail-biting bid has sparked furious arguments , with both companies protesting to the panel about each other 's tactics.Prior to Friday 's deadline , CE Electric already held nearly 30 percent of Northern , bought on the open market , and had previously declared acceptances that brought its holding up to around 34 percent.Northern has claimed it has the backing of its largest institutional investor , the Prudential , which holds around 11 percent , as well as other funds including M & amp ; G and Foreign & amp ; Colonial.The bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds fending off Trafalgar House , now owned by Norway 's Kvaerner , last year.Northern has consistently claimed the CE bid undervalued it and called for a higher price.It said 700 pence per share was indicated in talks before CE Electric launched the offer on October 28 , a claim that the U.S. bidder denied .
It says it is offering a fair price.If Northern falls to CE , it would be the tenth of the 12 cash-rich Regional Electricity Companies ( Recs ) set up at privatisation in 1990 to be taken over since the government 's protective golden share expired in March 1995.It would also be the fourth to be taken over by an American company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London respectively currently under way.American companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining Recs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful English-speaking springboard for expansion into Europe .
U.S. group Entergy finally agreed a 1.267 billion pound ( $ 2.11 billion ) takeover of British regional electricity company ( Rec ) London Electricity on Wednesday , after talks between them were called off in November.London 's chairman Sir Bob Reid did an excellent job of extracting a generous price out of us , Entergy chairman and chief executive officer Ed Lupberger told Reuters.Entergy and London , which supplies power to the capital and the City financial district , said in a joint statement that the bid valued London shares at 705 pence each and that shareholders would retain the right to receive a 14.3 pence interim dividend.Reid said the offer represents fair value for London Electricity and is in the best interests of London Electricity 's shareholders , customers and employees.London 's shares leapt to a high of 690 pence but later eased back to be up three pence at 685 pence by 1135 GMT.Lupberger declined to comment on the process leading up to the bid.The two companies conceded in a statement in November that talks between them had broken down after the Wall Street Journal Europe reported that Entergy was considering a 1.2 billion pound bid at around 700 pence per share.Entergy said Wednesday 's offer , made through bid vehicle Entergy Power UK Plc , would create a partnership through which both companies can pool expertise and working practices to further improve operating efficiencies.Entergy joins two other U.S. companies which are currently pursuing Recs .
Dominion Resources has agreed a $ 2.15 billion takeover of East Midlands Electricity and CalEnergy 's CE Electric unit has made a hostile 650 pence per share bid for Northern which closes on Friday.The floodgates for further bids in the sector were opened last Friday when the British government decided CalEnergy 's bid , which the market had seen as more contentious than the agreed offer , could go ahead with some conditions.Dominion 's bid still awaits UK approval but analysts said there were no immediate reasons why this offer or Entergy 's bid should be blocked after approval of CalEnergy 's offer.Entergy 's bid sparked gains in shares of Yorkshire and Southern , the only two Recs which remain independent and currently unsolicited of the original 12 cash-rich Recs created at privatisation in 1990.Yorkshire was up six pence to 765 pence on Wednesday morning while Southern gained four pence to 768.Entergy 's Lupberger said taking over London Electricity would enable the U.S. firm to build a new opportunity in the European marketplace.Reid said Entergy 's plans to use London as a platform for expansion into Europe were particularly exciting , adding that the deal would offer opportunities all round.Entergy said the bid would also enable it to gain experience for the development of its U.S. business after deregulation.Entergy , like many U.S. companies , sees the UK electricity supply sector as an attractive area to gain experience of deregulation and supply markets.Entergy is based in New Orleans and has interests there in both generation and supply of electricity .
( $ 1=.6003 Pound ) British regional electricity company ( REC ) Northern Electric Plc on Tuesday lost a bitter battle to stay independent , finally falling to a 782 million pound ( $ 1.31 billion ) bid from U.S. utility CalEnergy Co Inc.CalEnergy 's CE Electric won control with a wafer-thin majority , gaining the support of 50.3 percent of the votes , a margin of just 300,000 shares.The bid was so closely fought that it ran over its original deadline and the outcome was uncertain right down to the wire.Insurer Prudential Corp stepped in at the eleventh hour to try to thwart CE 's move by buying up nearly one million Northern shares from investors who had previously accepted CE 's bid.We look forward to working with Northern Electric 's management to put in place a smooth transition , CE Electric 's chairman and chief executive David Sokol said in a statement.Northern said it would not make an immediate statement.We will give a recommendation to shareholders after Christmas , a Northern spokesman said.Last Friday 's original bid deadline was extended to 1300 GMT on Tuesday after CE protested about share purchases by Northern 's advisers Schroders and BZW and a 250,000 pound fee to BZW not disclosed until Friday.On Monday an appeal by Northern to reverse the deadline extension was rejected by the Takeover Panel , which polices mergers and acquisitions in the City of London.Analysts said the takeover battle would leave a number of questions to be answered over the role of advisers.The bid was the second hostile takeover that Northern had faced -- it spent 560 million pounds fending off Trafalgar House , now owned by Norway 's Kvaerner.Northern , which was then the first privatised British power company to become a takeover target , initially received a billion pound bid from Trafalgar House at the end of 1994.But the offer was scuppered when electricity industry regulator Stephen Littlechild announced plans for more stringent price controls , sending electricity share prices tumbling.Northern 's fall marks the tenth of the 12 cash-rich RECS privatised in 1990 to be taken over since they became available when the government 's golden share expired in March 1995.It is also the fourth to be taken over by a U.S. company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London Electricity , respectively , currently under way.American companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining RECs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful springboard for expansion into Europe.Among potential bidders , analysts named Houston Industries , which failed in its attempt to secure control of Norweb with Central & amp ; South West Corp in October 1995.Florida Power & amp ; Light and Pacific Gas & amp ; Electric , which have both been rumoured previously to be interested in RECS , are again being eyed as possible buyers.Entergy of the U.S. has just clinched an agreed 1.267 billion pound deal to take over London Electricity , which provides power to the capital and its financial heart , the City.The electricity companies have attracted harsh criticism from lobby groups and the British media over fat executive pay packets , shareholder payouts and spiralling takeover prices .
( $ 1=.5977 Pound ) Electricity generator Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc turned in lower than expected half year profits on Thursday but hiked its dividend by 11 percent.We aim to keep on delivering dividend improvement ... doing it by expanding the business , chief executive Roger Young told Reuters in an interview.Pretax profits edged down to 61.3 million pounds ( $ 101.6 million ) from 61.7 million previously , below expectations of 63 to 70.7 million .
The dividend was 5.28 pence per share.The shares were down 1-1/2 pence at 316.5p at 1145 GMT.Scottish Hydro said low rainfall had hit profits , as hydro-electric generation had been replaced in part by coal at a cost of 6.3 million pounds.But chairman Lord Wilson said in a statement that the second half had started well and he was confident of an encouraging result for the full 12 month period.Scottish Hydro said it was preferred bidder for the 50 percent stake in Keadby power station , northeast England , owned by United Utilities , its joint venture partner there , and aimed to complete the deal by the end of the current financial year.Young said the plan would increase costs but also increase profits , adding an extra 340 megaWatt of generation capacity to the company 's existing portfolio.Scottish Hydro said the deal should increase gearing to around 50 percent if it went ahead and added that together with existing expenditure commitments , gearing should peak at 65 percent in 1998-99.We are confident of the prospects for Keadby and look forward to the opportunity to exploit its capabilities in the market place , the company said in a statement.Young said the company aimed to boost market share to seven percent from a current four percent by 1999 with a total investment in combined heat and power ( CHP ) plant for commercial customers of over 150 million pounds.The company said that action taken to raise output and cut costs would improve performance over the next two to three years and added that raising standards was a key aim.Scottish Hydro said that changes proposed to capital allowances in the British budget in November were expected to reverse a trend of falling tax rates but added it would not be possible to predict the impact accurately until full details were known.The company will be looking to expand its domestic business , Young said , but a resumption of talks with British Gas on the sale of the latter 's supply interests was unlikely , he added.I would not be optimistic of a resumption , he said.British Gas announced in September that talks on the sale of its domestic gas supply business in England and Scotland to Scottish Hydro had been called off , scotching newspaper reports that the sale would bring in around 250 million pounds.Young said the breakdown was for administrative rather than commerical reasons.There was no serious commercial difficulty that caused the project to be dropped ... British Gas had a lot of competition for its ( administrative ) resources , he said.But he said the moment for the deal might now have passed .
Deals tend to have their day , he said , adding that there .
were other discussions around , but nothing that we can talk about .
( $ 1=.6034 Pound ) British supermarket group J. Sainsbury Plc dropped a profits warning bombshell into the market on Friday , sending its own shares plummeting by 13 percent and bringing other stocks under pressure.Sainsbury said pretax profits for the current year before a provision of 50 million pounds ( $ 81.7 million ) would be 640-650 million pounds , well below consensus forecasts of over 700 million , as it admitted the cost of improving sales would hurt.It said sales from existing supermarket stores rose 4.4 percent in the eight weeks to January 11 , an improvement on the three percent gain seen in October but still behind market leader Tesco 's 7.5 percent jump , reported on Monday.Sainsbury shares slumped 53 pence to 339 pence by 1600 GMT , falling below arch-rival Tesco 's share price for the first time .
Tesco shares shed eight to 360 pence.Sainsbury 's fall has destabilised the whole sector and there are worries margins will be under pressure if competition hots up , said one analyst who asked not to be identified.ASDA , which prides itself on being the cheapest of the big four supermarkets , eased 2.75 pence to 121-1/2 pence while Safeway dropped 13 to 389-1/2.I 'm amazed that ( Sainsbury 's ) price has n't fallen further , said Nick Bubb , analyst at Mees Pierson , adding that Sainsbury still looked overpriced compared with the rest of the sector.Before profit downgrades , Sainsbury was on a forecast price to earnings ratio of 14 , according to Reuters 3000 data from Edinburgh Financial , towards the top end of the food retailing sector , ahead of Safeway and ASDA.The shares have quite rightly been marked down to a market rating but a discount rating would be more appropriate , said one sector analyst who asked not to be identified.Some observers suggested Sainsbury might be prompted to cut prices in an effort to move sales ahead , but analysts said it was more likely to look at boosting offers and advertising.Price is not in vogue at the moment , added one analyst who asked not to be named.But Dave Stoddart at Henderson Crosthwaite pointed out that any cost-additive or gross margin-reducing activity will worry the market and pressure other shares.Analysts downgraded Sainsbury profit forecasts for 1997/98 as well , with Bubb looking for pretax profits of 673 million pounds from a previous forecast of 780 million pounds.I had no idea ( sales growth ) would have cost them so much ... the cost benefit of the sales improvement is way out of line , Bubb said.Sainsbury chairman David Sainsbury said in a statement that he was disappointed that the costs of building sales across the businesses have impacted group profit.Sainsbury 's chief executive of Homebase do-it-yourself and U.S. businesses David Bremner said the company 's Reward loyalty card accounted for probably the majority of the impact on sales growth but admitted there was a short-term cost.He told Reuters the task facing management next year was to improve profits , adding that obviously , we would always like to improve sales .
Sainsbury was forced to launch Reward after the success of ClubCard helped Tesco to boost sales and leap ahead of Sainsbury as market leader .
( $ 1=.6119 Pound ) British supermarket group Safeway Plc is currently seeing a zero inflation rate excluding petrol , deputy chairman David Webster told Reuters in an interview.Inflation excluding petrol is now probably zero , he said.But Webster said the fall in prices was nothing to do with a price war .
Webster said he felt shoppers are pulling in their belts a little more than usual , and added he felt it was a sector issue.But he said he thought a price war remained very unlikely.Safeway said in a statement that price inflation had fallen in the early weeks of the new year from a modest 1.1 percent gain seen in the five weeks to January 4.It said sales growth over the key Christmas trading period had been 5.2 percent but over the first 16 weeks of the second half that had slowed to a 4.5 percent gain.In the last four weeks the sector and Safeway have come off quite sharply in terms of overall sales performance , Webster said.Safeway said in its statement that if current rates of sales growth and inflation continued , profits in the final eight weeks of its year , which ends in March , might be affected.Webster said it was very hard to judge whether the slowdown in sales would continue .
We continue to see significant deflation in produce , which is 10 percent of total sales , he said.He declined to give details of the impact on margins , however. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 The bid battle for British regional electricity company ( Rec ) Northern Electric was on a knife edge on Friday as predator CE Electric won an extension to 2400 GMT for an announcement of the result.CE , which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S. , had slapped a deadline of 1300 GMT on Friday for acceptances of its 650 pence-a-share bid which values Northern at 782 million pounds ( $ 1.3 billion ) and the result was expected by 1700 GMT.But the authorities later agreed to allow the extension under British bidding rules as counting and matching of share acceptance forms continued.CE Electric already held nearly 30 percent of Northern , bought on the open market , and had previously declared acceptances which brought its holding up to around 34 percent.Northern has claimed it has the backing of its largest institutional investor , the Prudential , which holds around 11 percent , as well as other funds including M & amp ; G and Foreign & amp ; Colonial.The bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds fending off Trafalgar House , now owned by Norway 's Kvaerner , last year.That left it with depleted resources to fight this time , but it has promised a 17 percent hike in its dividend and vowed its gearing will be down to 95 percent by March 1997 compared with previous forecasts of 175 percent.Northern has consistently claimed that the bid undervalued it and called for a higher price.It said 700 pence per share was indicated in talks before CE Electric launched the offer on October 28 , a claim which the Americans have denied , saying that the bid is fair value.Northern 's share price closed in London up 2-1/2 pence at 640 pence in a generally firm market on Friday.Northern is the only Rec to have fought off a takeover after it spent 560 million pounds to fend off Trafalgar House , now owned by Norway 's Kvaerner , last year.If it falls to CE , it would be the tenth of the 12 cash-rich Recs set up at privatisation in 1990 to be taken over since they came up for grabs when the government 's protective golden share expired in March 1995.It would also be the fourth to be taken over by an American company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London respectively currently underway.American companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining Recs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful English-speaking springboard for expansion into Europe.Among potential bidders , analysts named Houston Industries , which failed in its attempt to secure control of Norweb with Central & amp ; South West Corp in October 1995.Florida Power & amp ; Light and Pacific Gas & amp ; Electric , which have both been rumoured previously to be interested in Recs , are again being eyed as possible buyers.The UK Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang has made it clear that he will consider bids on a case by case basis and only judge whether they should be referred to monopoly investigation on competition grounds.CE Electric 's bid had been clouded by worries that Lang might block the move because of political concerns or to avoid reducing the number of benchmarks in the sector used by the industry regulator Offer.There had been worries that the ruling pro-privatisation Conservative party , which lags the opposition Labour party in the polls and must call a general election by May , might not want further takeovers in the unpopular sector.Electricity companies have increasingly attracted harsh criticism from lobby groups and the media over hefty executive pay packets , huge shareholder payouts and spiralling takeover prices.Lang 's decision to clear CE Electric 's bid on December 6 lifted a cloud from Northern 's shares , which had been languishing around 600 pence.It also indicated that other bids might not face any regulatory hurdles.In less than a week , Entergy of the U.S. clinched an agreed 1.267 billion pound deal to take over London Electricity , which provides power to the capital and its financial heart , the City .
( $ 1=.6002 Pound ) British supermarket group J. Sainsbury stunned markets on Friday and sent its shares reeling as it admitted the cost of improving sales will hit profits , wiping some 60 million pounds ( $ 98 million ) off forecasts.Sainsbury said in a statement that pretax profits for the year were expected to be 640-650 million pounds excluding a 50 million pound provision on its Texas do-it-yourself business , compared with analysts ' forecasts of over 700 million.Shares tumbled as analysts raced to downgrade forecasts , losing 43 pence , or almost 11 percent , to 349 pence.I had no idea ( sales growth ) would have cost them so much ... the cost benefit of the sales improvement is way out of line , said Nick Bubb , analyst at Mees Pierson.Sainsbury said sales from existing supermarkets rose 4.4 percent in the eight weeks ending January 11 and that trend has continued , compared with a three percent rise in October 1996.Arch-rival Tesco , which pushed Sainsbury off the market leader slot over a year ago , earlier this week reported sales growth of 7.5 percent over the key Christmas period.We are disappointed that the costs of building sales across the businesses have impacted group profit , chairman David Sainsbury said in a statement.Bubb said he was amazed that the share price has not fallen further , adding that Sainsbury still looked overpriced compared to the rest of the supermarket sector.Before profit downgrades , Sainsbury was on a forecast price to earnings ratio of 14 , according to Reuters 3000 data from Edinburgh Financial , towards the top end of the food retailing sector , ahead of Safeway and ASDA.The shares have quite rightly been marked down to a market rating but a discount rating would be more appropriate , said one sector analyst who asked not to be identified.Sainsbury 's chief executive of Homebase do-it-yourself and U.S. businesses David Bremner said the company 's Reward loyalty card accounted for probably the majority of the impact on sales growth but admitted there was a short-term cost.He told Reuters the task facing management next year was to improve profits , adding that obviously , we would always like to improve sales.Sainsbury was forced to launch Reward after the success of ClubCard helped Tesco to boost sales and leap ahead of Sainsbury as market leader at the end of 1995.Reward 's costs have edged up to around 0.75 percent of sales compared with 0.4 percent in the first half , the analyst said , which could imply a need for sales growth nearer five percent.The costs of loyalty are clearly greater than they thought , he said.Analysts were concerned that Sainsbury might have to sink more investment to improve sales and profits and forecasts for 1997/98 were also cut , with Bubb slashing estimates to 673 million pounds from 780 million previously.Sainsbury said that management was now focused on turning increased sales into profit growth , but analysts questioned how this could be achieved.What do they have to do next , what more costs need to go in ?
asked one sector analyst.Bubb added that despite Homebase 's strong sales , which bounced 7.8 percent from existing stores in the 16 weeks to January 11 , the 50 million pound provision was a concern.Sainsbury said it aimed to convert an extra 25 Texas stores , which it bought from Ladbroke in 1995 , to its Homebase format , which has given an uplift of 40 percent in sales at stores already given the new format.The full store conversion process remains the key to unlocking the potential of the Texas acquisition , Sainsbury said .
( $ 1=.6119 Pound ) China and the United States made progress on Thursday in talks on a new textile accord but negotiations could stretch late into the night on the last day before a deadline for agreement , a U.S. trade official said.We hope to complete the talks tonight , chief negotiator Rita Hayes said after talks on Thursday morning with officials at China 's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.Progress had been made on market access , she said.However , the two sides still had a long way to go on the third day of talks to renew a 1994 textile accord and resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports , she said.Washington could make significant cuts to China 's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the January 31 deadline , Hayes said.We still have a lot of issues , so that means a lot of work today , probably late into the night , she said .
We are not going to give China another extension because we have already given them another month.The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries , The United States has threatened multi-million dollar penalties and raised the spectre of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue.I am always optimistic and I am in hopes that we will complete the round today ... but that is something both sides have to work very hard on , Hayes said.If an agreement was not reached in time , past practice showed that the United States could cut China 's textile import quota significantly until a deal was struck , she said.I am in hopes that it wo n't come to that , China does n't want it to come to that -- and certainly the States does n't , she said.In Washington , acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said on Wednesday the talks were proceeding fairly well.Washington slapped $ 19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September , saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles , farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.Textiles are just one of a range of issues dogging a Sino-U.S. relationship that has long been strained by disputes over topics ranging from trade to human rights to Taiwan.A U.S. delegation arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for talks on human rights with Chinese officials , after a year in which almost all remaining members of the nation 's tiny pro-democracy movement have been either imprisoned or driven into exile.U.S .
trade official Lee Sands began talks in Beijing on Thursday to discuss China 's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , long a source of cross-Pacific friction.Beijing , which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries , has accused Washington of blocking its entry.Hayes said a key U.S. requirement was further opening of China 's protected markets .
What we are asking China for is upfront market access , before they join the WTO .
We are still working out those differences .
A Burmese minister has urged Tokyo to release a multi-billion yen loan suspended after the bloody suppression of Burma 's democracy movement , but Japanese officials said curbs on lending were still in force.Planning and development minister Brigadier General David Abel called on Japan to restart support for the upgrading of Rangoon 's airport that was suspended in 1988 after the military bloodily crushed a pro-democracy uprising.Speaking after a conference on regional cooperation held in China 's southwestern Kunming city , Abel told reporters Japan 's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund ( OECF ) had itself proposed restarting the loan , worth over 20 billion yen ( $ 185 million ) .We have signed an agreement with the OECF for them to continue the loan , Abel said on Saturday .
They proposed it , so they should agree it.Some Japanese officials have long hoped to step up financial assistance to Burma , one of southeast Asia 's poorest nations , but OECF officials said on Saturday that curbs on lending to the nation 's ruling military junta remained in force.This ( loan ) was stopped due to the political situation in Burma in 1988 , said Kenzi Yoshida of the OECF 's operations department.The situation remains the same , it remains suspended , Yoshida said , adding that under government guidelines the state-backed fund had banned all new loans to Rangoon.Differences of opinion over how to deal with Burma formed an unspoken backdrop to the Kunming meeting of ministers from the Mekong River region , which ended on Friday.Ministers from six nations -- Burma , China , Cambodia , Laos , Thailand and Vietnam -- attended the conference but the meeting was backed by Asian Development Bank , which is funded and managed partly by western nations.The leader of Burma 's democratic opposition , Aung San Suu Kyi , is spearheading a campaign for sanctions to heap pressure on the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) -- raising pressures in the west for economic action against the military rulers.Western anger at the SLORC was fuelled in May when it detained more than 260 members of Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) and in June following the death in a Rangoon jail of Danish honorary consul James Nichols.A number of major Western firms have in recent months cut or scaled back investment in Burma following intense lobbying by activists protesting against its human rights record.Burma 's neighbours in the seven-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations have rejected calls for sanctions , favouring instead a policy of constructive engagement toward Rangoon.Japan had last year considered resuming yen loans to Burma following the release of Nobel Peace prize Laureate Suu Kyi from almost six years of house arrest and suggestions that Rangoon would begin paying its debt arrears , Yoshida said.Such ideas were shelved when suppression of the democracy movement continued and the arrears were not paid , he said.Both things have to be resolved , he said , adding Japan remained involved in only a few small-scale projects in Burma 's electricity generation and transmission sectors .
Former U.S. president George Bush called on Thursday for an end to U.S. trade threats against China , saying more dialogue was needed between Washington and Beijing to mend cross-Pacific ties.The United States should give China permanent Most Favoured Nation ( MFN ) trade status to end the annual diplomatic battle over its renewal , Bush said in a speech at a seminar in Beijing.I am very concerned about the rancour that sometimes rears its head these days , he said .
There is too much China-bashing in the United States of America.Some members of the U.S. Congress had little understanding of China and how to deal with Beijing , Bush said.Threatening China does not work , he said .
It might be good domestic politics in some quarters of the United States , but it does not bring about change , and it ought to stop.Relations between Washington and Beijing have been badly strained this year by disputes over trade , copyright theft , nuclear proliferation and Taiwan.Washington needs a strategic dialogue with Beijing to iron out differences before they become major disputes and to help stabilise a bilateral relationship that was of unsurpassed importance , Bush said.We can start by granting permanent , unconditional MFN for China , he told the Chinese and U.S. businessmen and officials in a speech salted with nostalgic references to his experiences as a diplomat in Beijing during the 1970s.MFN give favourable tariff treatment to Chinese goods imported into the U.S.Sino-U.S. ties chilled in March when Chinese missile tests off the coast of rival Taiwan led Washigton to send two aircraft carrier battle groups into the area in a show of force.In June , the two sides narrowly averted a multi-billion dollar trade war over intellectual property theft in China , while alleged sales of Chinese nuclear technology to Pakistan and Beijing 's fat U.S. trade surplus have also strained ties.Both sides say relations have warmed in the last few months but Bush said more was needed , advising Beijing to value the contribution of U.S. businessmen in China -- a group that has long campaigned for better ties and permanent MFN.American business is China 's best ally in reducing the misunderstanding and suspicions that cloud our relationship from time to time , Bush said .
China 's lumbering state firms are putting more effort into making products they can actually sell , but huge stockpiles of unwanted goods remain a blot on the economic landscape , officials said on Monday.At the end of October the total amount of capital tied up in inventories of 380,000 enterprises across China had reached 540 billion yuan ( $ 65 billion ) , 80 billion yuan more than at the beginning of 1996 , State Statistical Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said.While some of the inventories were a result of normal production and marketing processes , much was unreasonable , Ye told a news conference.Of the total 540 billion yuan in stocks , 150 billion yuan is unreasonable , he said but gave no details.Many state-owned firms , long accustomed to mass-production for a command economy , have struggled to adjust to China 's new consumer-led markets and continue to churn out millions of yuan worth of unsellable goods.State media reported last week that excessive investment by enterprises in some industries had resulted in mountains of warehoused goods ranging from bicycles to wristwatches.The stockpiles included about 1.5 billion unsold men 's shirts -- about three shirts for every adult Chinese male.Chinese officials say concentration of investment in certain industries has led to cut-throat competition resulting in losses , monopolies and local protectionism.Beijing has vowed to curb blind investment by provinces in some industries , but economists say defiance from regional authorities will hamper the central government 's efforts.Ye said firms had progressively improved the quality of their investment in new production throughout 1996.Enterprises ... are paying more attention to efficiency and to the quality and variety of their products , he said .
Blind production has been reduced.The national sales rate for industrial products had risen to 96.27 percent in November from 93.04 percent in the first quarter , he said.Large stockpiles held by state enterprises have compounded their difficulties in clearing interlocking triangular debt among firms unable to pay their bills to one another.The value of outstanding accounts , or funds owed , by 380,000 state firms had soared to 900 billion yuan by the end of October , up 100 billion yuan from the start of the year , Ye said.He said state statisticians believed about one-third of the 900 billion yuan in debt was unreasonable , apparently hinting that this might not be repayable .
( $ 1=8.3 yuan ) China on Thursday ordered two 747 airliners from U.S. aviation giant Boeing Co in a multimillion dollar deal that Washington 's ambassador to China said was hastened by upcoming visits by U.S. congressmen.The two jets would be powered by engines from Pratt and Whitney , a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp , and would be delivered in 1999 to Air China , Beijing 's international carrier , officials of the China Aviation Supplies Corp said.Closure of the $ 383 million contract , which follows the purchase of three 747-400s by Air China in July last year , had been hastened by imminent visits to Beijing of about 35 U.S. congressmen , said U.S. ambassador James Sasser.This Boeing contract is something that has been under discussion for some time , Sasser told reporters .
Clearly there was an effort to try to finalise this transaction on the eve of the visit of a number of senators and congressmen.One official bipartisan delegation of around 22 U.S. congressmen is scheduled to arrive in Beijing next week for talks with Chinese officials that are expected to include touchy issues such as the Sino-U.S. trade balance and human rights.Relations between Washington and Beijing have long been battered by disputes over trade , Taiwan , copyright piracy and China 's human rights record , but both sides say ties warmed in the latter half of 1996.Chinese efforts to ease Beijing 's swelling and highly sensitive trade surplus with the United States were likely to provide a boost to U.S. exports to China , Sasser said.I think you will see over the coming months an effort on the part of the Chinese to make additional purchases of U.S. goods , in an effort to try to even up as much as possible the present trade deficit with the United States , he said.The United States says it has a trade deficit with China , reaching nearly $ 29 billion in the first nine months of last year .
Beijing insists that its customs figures show a surplus in favour of the United States.The ambassador declined to give details of the deals likely to be agreed or to say which sectors might benefit most.Some U.S. businessmen say high-profile sales are among the earliest casualties of Sino-U.S. diplomatic spats , and Boeing has in the past hinted that it has lost deals to European archrival Airbus Industrie for political reasons.Boeing officials at the Thursday signing declined to comment on whether the 747 contract had been hastened by the recent thawing in cross-Pacific ties , but Regional Director for Aircraft Contracts Arthur Abel said the deal was heartening.We are just very encouraged and optimistic about our long term relationship with China , Abel told Reuters.A Boeing statement said the two 286-passenger 747 Combis it would supply to Air China marked a strong vote of confidence in the U.S. planemaker from an airline that already operated 45 of its aircraft.Officials of the state-run China Air Supplies Corp also welcomed the deal , although they identified the ordered aircraft as 301-seat 747-400s .
After years of efforts to gain entry to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , China no longer cares whether it joins the global trade body , Tuesday 's China Daily quoted a senior customs official as saying.Accession or not , China has become indifferent and does n't care any more , the official newspaper quoted Wu Jiahuang , director-general of the customs administration 's tariffs department , as saying.Western diplomats in the capital said Wu 's comments were more a reflection of differing internal views on the importance of the global economy rather than a signal of a shift away from Beijing 's oft-stated desire to join the world 's trade club.Wu compared China 's decade-long bid for entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , and the current attempts to join the WTO that succeeded it , to a sunken boat and an ailing tree , the China Daily said in a front-page report.Beijing is seeking to join the WTO on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries , but some members -- with the United States most vocal -- argue that China 's economy is too large and powerful to be given such treatment.China 's leadership had concluded that negotiations with WTO members on its entry terms were politically tainted , Wu said.The high-profile publication of Wu 's views on WTO accession could be aimed at signalling that China was in no hurry to make concessions on terms , but was more likely an expression of internal differences , said one Western diplomat.They have their different interest groups in China , just as we have , he said .
There are those who are charged with administering the tariffs and taking in the receipts and those who have a longer-term perspective on the whole thing.It does n't change the basic fact that those who are charged with representing China in this matter do give us a different impression , he said.Customs officials declined to comment on Wu 's remarks , but officials of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation ( MOFTEC ) said they represented a personal opinion and China 's formal stance was unchanged.MOFTEC 's more cheerful view of WTO accession was reflected in the inside pages of the China Daily , which quoted assistant minister An Min as saying early entry could boost investment.Optimistically speaking , the problem ( concerning China 's WTO membership ) could be solved next year , An said.China says it must be allowed a relatively long transition period to prepare key industries for the fierce foreign competition they would face under the WTO 's freer trade rules.It was unrealistic to demand that China open its markets too wide too soon , the official People 's Daily newspaper on Tuesday quoted MOFTEC Minister Wu Yi as saying.Market opening was a gradual process that required economic stability and prosperity , she said.Tariffs chief Wu said Beijing was puzzled by the actions of developed countries such as the United States , European Union members and Canada that slapped quotas on Chinese textiles but refused to allow China time to protect its key industries.In their anxiety to carve out markets in China , chief WTO member countries have ignored China 's rightful reasons to protect its national industries , he said.China had been able to expand international trade to 44 percent of gross national product by 1995 , despite a decade of fruitless efforts to join GATT and the WTO , he said .
Washington 's top textile trade negotiator said on Thursday talks with China on a textile accord were likely to stretch late into the night on the last day before a Friday deadline for agreement.The two sides made progess but still had a long way to go on the third day of talks to renew their 1994 textile accord and resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports , negotiator Rita Hayes told reporters.Washington could make significant cuts to China 's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the January 31 deadline , Hayes said before resuming the talks with officials at China 's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.We still have a lot of issues , so that means a lot of work today , probably late into the night , she said .

Hong Kong 's leader-designate Tung Chee-hwa said on Thursday a series of meetings with China 's top communist leaders had boosted his confidence in the future of the British colony under Chinese sovereignty next year.Shipping magnate Tung also said he could foresee no problems in the territory that would require Beijing 's help after the territory returned to China at midnight on June 30 , 1997.At the moment I can see no problems that would require the special help of the central government , Tung told a news conference a day after Chinese President Jiang Zemin assured him of Beijing 's full support after he takes office.If such a situation were to arise , Tung said he would immediately ask for assistance from Beijing.Jiang on Wednesday greeted Tung with a pledge of support and a vow not to tread on Hong Kong 's right to autonomy after 150 years of British colonial rule come to an end.The appointment of the tycoon turned chief executive designate to lead Hong Kong from July 1 next year marked the dawn of a new age , Jiang said.Tung said he would return home with greater confidence in Hong Kong 's future after his meetings in Beijing with Jiang and Premier Li Peng that set the communist seal of approval on his selection as Hong Kong 's first leader of the post-colonial era.China 's leaders all stressed their sincerity in granting Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under the principle of one country , two systems , Tung said , referring to Beijing 's pledge not to meddle with Hong Kong 's capitalist system for 50 years.That gave me even more confidence in Hong Kong 's future , he said.Asked about the rank he expected to be accorded in China 's communist or state bureaucracy , Tung stressed the unique position Hong Kong would hold after its return to China.I think I will not be ranked with anybody else because we are a special sitution , he said .
We are going to exercise a high degree of autonomy.However , he urged Hong Kong 's 6.3 million people to face the fact of China 's decision to disband the territory 's existing elected legislature after the handover and to replace it with its own appointed provisional body.The best way to minimise conflict is to recognise the reality of the provisional legislature , Tung said when asked how he would deal with potential conflicts caused by the existence of a Hong Kong-elected legislature as well as a Beijing-approved body in the run-up to the handover.There is a need for the provisional legislature to start meeting before July 1 because there is work that needs to be done in order to avoid a legal vacuum , he said.Tung 's first visit to Beijing since his appointment is being closely watched by Hong Kong residents keen to know more about his plans for the first post-colonial adminstration and to learn whether current senior civil servants will keep their jobs.On the issue of civil servant appointments , Tung said this would be among his first duties when he returned , but gave no hint of his position or intentions.I do things rather methodically , step by step , and I will do that on this issue as well , he said.Tung , who has warned Hong Kong 's people to be sensitive to China 's sovereign rights , has yet to give details of his plans for the post-colonial administration.While China has said it will leave Hong Kong 's free-wheeling capitalist system intact after the handover , it has made clear that the authoritiy of the territory 's leader will have limits .
Microsoft Corp on Tuesday launched a Chinese version of its Windows NT 4.0 software , saying the network operating system was a vital advance for the U.S giant into China 's infant but fast-growing software market.Microsoft , which saw its return to official favour in China marred when anti-communist phrases were found in its Windows 95 programme in September , was determined to lead the nation 's growing software industry , company officials said.The speed at which computing is taking off here is really incredible , Microsoft Greater China Regional Director Bryan Nelson told a briefing before the launch of Windows NT 4.0.While still small by international standards and plagued by copyright piracy that was costing Microsoft millions of dollars a year , the Chinese market was developing quickly , Nelson said.The marketplace is maturing very fast , there 's a long way to go but it 's extremely exciting , he said.Windows NT 4.0 , which combines the Windows 95 interface with more powerful 32-bit software for networks of personal computers , would sell mainly to large Chinese and foreign companies operating on the mainland , company officials said.The system , released alongside Microsoft 's Workstation 4.0 and equipped with a Chinese version of its Internet browser , was a key addition to the China product range , Nelson said.Products like NT for us are absolutely vital , he said , adding that the local version of Windows NT 4.0 , which works with the simplified characters used on the mainland , was a step towards tapping Chinese enthusiasm for the Internet.The Internet in China is red hot , he said .
There are so many projects ... being done on the Internet and intranets that we ca n't service them all.Microsoft 's Internet applications would allow controls on access to particular sites on the worldwide computer network -- a sensitive issue in China where officials have said they are keen to block sites deemed politically hostile or pornographic.You could call it censorship ... ( but ) there 's nothing different in our Chinese product than in our English versions , said Microsoft Regional Marketing Director Fernando de Sousa.Demand for ways to control Internet access existed in Western markets as well , he said.Nelson said Microsoft 's ties with Chinese officials had more than recovered after the discovery of phrases once favoured by Beijing 's Nationalist rivals in Taiwan in the Windows 95 programme.Microsoft , whose negotiations with Beijing were once described by a Chinese official as a trial of strength , saw its return to favour threatened by phrases such as communist bandits and Taiwan independence.The discovery of the phrases forced Microsoft to temporarily stop shipping the system and prompted angry articles in Chinese newspapers about the U.S. firm 's cultural insensitivity.It was a challenging time ... ( but ) the follow-up has been a closer relationship , Nelson said , adding that Microsoft and Chinese officials had taken just six days to resolve the issue.The company had lost more in terms of market momentum than in the financial outlay needed to correct the software and issue free updates to previous buyers , he said.While copyright piracy continued to be a problem in China , with unlicensed use running at up to 95 percent for some applications , Microsoft had seen some improvment in the domestic market , Nelson said.The company had seen no progress from Beijing 's clampdown on pirates who exported counterfeit goods , he said .
Tsingtao Brewery built its reputation as China 's king of beers earlier this century by catering to thirsty foreign invaders.But analysts warn that after years at the top , a complacent Tsingtao today is seeing a new breed of invader -- this time in the form of nimble foreign beer makers -- eat into its once-impregnable market share.The brewery in eastern China 's Shandong province , which in 1993 became the first Chinese company to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange has rested on their laurels for too long , said one Beijing-based beer industry analyst.While Tsingtao has begun to respond to the threat from foreign-funded joint ventures and upstart domestic brewing groups , it still relies too much on its traditional brand-name prestige and is being out-advertised by thirstier rivals , he said.Company officials at the brewery 's home in the scenic port city of Qingdao -- formerly Romanised as Tsingtao -- say they feel the pressure but are ready to fight back.We do n't feel there is a crisis , said general manager Peng Zuoyi , the head of a new management team appointed earlier this year to boost the brewery 's prospects.Tsingtao plans to boost production to 500,000 tonnes this year , from 350,000 tonnes in 1995 , and hike annual output to 1.4 million tonnes by 2000 , Peng told reporters at the brewery.LIFE CAN BE HARDER IN A MARKET ECONOMYUnder communist China 's old command economy , Tsingtao was a luxury commodity in chronically short supply .
But Peng said the market economy and the arrival of foreign brands were taking their toll.Before the foreigners came to China , almost all the high-class restaurants and hotels had our Tsingtao Beer , Peng said .
In the market where we were once 100 percent , we now account for perhaps 70-80 percent.Against the glamour of foreign beers , Tsingtao touts its unique heritage as the premier domestic beer in one of the world 's fastest-growing markets.The company was founded in 1903 and initially targeted thirsty Germans living in the port city that Germany had wrested from a weak China.Company officials say the beer also thrived during the Japanese occupation before and during World War Two.The decades of state control that followed the communist revolution of 1949 were a factor behind Tsingtao 's later neglect of its home market , said Elizabeth Cheng , head of China research at HSBC James Capel in Hong Kong.Now with the new management , hopefully they will be able to do something more dynamic , Cheng said.A LACK OF TRANSPARENCYGrowing competition is not the only worry cited by analysts , who have long complained about a lack of transparency at the brewery , which is still 44 percent state-owned.In 1994 , the brewery drew investor ire when it was found to have lent out the foreign currency proceeds of its share flotations at high interest rates instead of investing them in its core business as promised.Peng said that problem was mainly a misunderstanding.In some ways Chinese methods are not quite the same as international ones , Peng said , adding that lack of a clear investment plan had caused Tsingtao to put its money elsewhere.The 4,000-strong workforce of the group , which has assets of 3.0 billion yuan ( $ 360 million ) , is another potential concern.They are vastly overstaffed , said the Beijing-based analyst , a view seemingly borne out by the relaxed approach of many workers observed during a recent visit to the brewery.Tsingtao says it still has up to 2.4 percent of the Chinese beer market , although the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) said last month that the share was now likely below 2.0 percent.While life as a listed company would never be as easy as it was under the command economy , the analysts said Tsingtao was too much of a national symbol to be allowed to fail.Tsingtao is also one of 10 domestic brewing groups that have been promised preferential loans and conditions from the government to help them compete with joint venture breweries .
( Tsingtao is ) troubled , but they will survive , said the Beijing-based analyst .
They have very powerful backing ... a lot of people do not want to see it go down the tubes .
Federal-Mogul Corp hopes to pay off $ 185 million in debt in 1997 , bringing its total debt to capital ratio to under 60 percent by the end of the year , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dick Snell said Thursday.Snell told Reuters in an interview other goals for 1997 include hitting a return on invested capital of 12 percent , although the year 's average will probably be below that.Over the last three years , Federal-Mogul has been earning from 4.5 percent to six percent on its capital -- below its cost of capital of 12 percent .
During 1998 , Snell would like the company to be earning a 10 percent return on sales .
Those are goals , he said .
I think we have a reasonable chance of making it , but I 'm not promising.The Southfield , Mich.-based auto parts supplier announced a broad restructuring Thursday that will take it out of the international retail business .
The restructuring and other one-time items resulted in a $ 264 million pre-tax charge.Federal-Mogul reduced its debt by $ 104 million in 1996 .
Debt-to-capital is 69 percent , although Snell said that will fall as the company sells off its retail operations .
Snell said the company has been in contact with possible buyers of the retail operations .
A single buyer for the whole package is unlikely , he said , noting the business could be sold in three to 10 different pieces .
The firm paid a total of about $ 125 million for the retail operations.We 're not going to give away the shareholders ' assets , he said .
We 're going to demand a good value for them.Snell said further consolidations of its North American distribution system and European operations are likely on top of those already announced .
Those will likely result in more headcount reductions over in the next few years .
Federal-Mogul plans to add a new position of vice president of marketing to improve customer relations , Snell said .
Finalsts have been selected for the job , which will also be responsible for shoring up the firm 's after-market brands.We have some very , very good well known aftermarket brands that have n't had much of any in the way of market support the past several years , which I think is sort of the hidden opportunity this company has , he said.As it digests the restructuring , Federal-Mogul will also be on the lookout for acquisitions that add to its core manufacturing businesses , said Snell .
For instance , since the firm makes engine bearings , it makes sense for it to also offer pistons , he said.Snell did not rule out the possibilty of an acquisition worth several hundred million in 1997 if the right opportunity arises.Salomon Brothers analyst Darren Kimball said Snell , who has been on the job 95 days , impressed investors and analysts with the moves announced Thursday.This is the kind of stock where if the numbers work out , the stock is going to work out because people want to like him , he said .
Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday profits jumped 82 percent to $ 1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as it rebounded from product launches that held profits down a year earlier.Ford , the last of the Big Three Detroit automakers to report fourth-quarter results , said the earnings equaled $ 1 a share .
The results reflected a total of $ 132 million in special charges , including costs related to Ford 's decision to cut 3,500 jobs last year.In the 1995 quarter , Ford earned $ 660 million , or 49 cents a share .
Sales rose to $ 38.8 billion from $ 34.6 billion.Excluding one-time items , Ford 's fourth quarter income was $ 1.10 a share -- higher than the $ 1.02 a share forecast by analysts , according to First Call , which tracks estimates.Although Ford appears to be making headway in cost reduction , analysts were not overly impressed , noting that sales of high-profit light truck products are booming.They were not great , especially in view of the fact that they are selling a lot trucks , said Maryann Keller , an analyst with Furman Selz & amp ; Co.Ford Chairman Alex Trotman said in a statement that automotive earnings will improve in 1997 , because the company has successfully completed its highest-volume launches in North America and Europe.We 're starting 1997 in a much stronger competitive position , he said.Trotman said Ford expects better results for all of 1997 in Europe , where the company is moving to cut costs .
Ford also predicted smaller losses in South America for 1997 , he added.Overall , we are on track , he said.Meantime , Ford Chief Financial Officer John Devine told reporters that cost-cutting will reach new heights in 1997 .
For the first time , Ford expects 1997 costs to be below those of the prior year.The fourth quarter results capped a mixed year for the automaker in which strong profits from its Financial Services Group were needed to offset a steady flow of red ink from overseas operations.Earnings for all of 1996 rose 7 percent to $ 4.4 billion , or $ 3.65 a share , from $ 4.1 billion , or $ 3.34 in 1995 .
Ford 's worldwide automotive operations posted net income of $ 1.6 billion , down from $ 2 billion .
Financial Services earned a record $ 2.8 billion in 1996 , up 33 percent over 1995.Revenues for the year climbed to $ 147.0 billion from $ 137.1 billion in 1995.Ford 's core U.S. automotive operations , which contribute about 65 percent of total automotive revenues , reported profits of $ 628 million for the fourth quarter , compared with $ 168 million a year ago.Ford continued to have problems overseas , but there were signs of progress in turning those operations around .
Ford 's European loss for the quarter rose to $ 88 million from $ 48 million .
But excluding $ 127 million in severance charges in the 1996 quarter , the operating results showed a $ 39 million profit , versus a $ 26 million operating profit last year.In South America , where Ford has struggled in the Brazilian market , the fourth quarter net loss was $ 287 million , compared with a $ 112 million loss a year ago.I thought the fourth quarter was an okay quarter .
What was most important was improvement on the cost front , said Ronald Glantz , an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.On Tuesday , General Motors Corp. said strike costs slashed fourth quarter earnings by 50 percent to $ 786 million .
Chrysler Corp. last week said fourth quarter earnings fell to $ 807 million , down from $ 1.04 billion.Ford 's stock lost 12.5 cents to close at 32.375 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Contract talks resumed Sunday between American Axle & amp ; Manufacturing Inc. and the United Auto Workers union after bargainers took a rest break following about 36 hours of non-stop negotiations.The two sides are attempting to hammer out a new contract for 7,200 UAW members at five plants in Detroit , Three Rivers , Mich. , and Buffalo , N.Y. A strike would force General Motors Corp. , to suspend production at its 11 North American light truck assembly plants within days , and cause more supplier headaches for Ford Motor Co..Company and union officials began talking about 6 a.m. Friday and recessed talks around the dinnertime Saturday night .
UAW leaders let a strike deadline expire midnight Friday without any picketing action .
No new deadline was set.The mood is still good .
Progress is being made , said a person close to the talks who did not want his name used.A union spokesman could not be reached for comment .
UAW members have continued to report for work and the company 's normal weekend operations of limited production and maintenance have gone on uninterrupted.American Axle , which was spun off from GM in 1994 , supplies rear axles for GM 's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles , axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars , as well as various parts for other passenger car lines.The company makes axle shafts that Ford uses in its F-150 pickup trucks , Expedition and Explorer sport/utilities and some rear-drive passenger cars .
It also makes axles for a small number of Chrysler Corp. light truck products.Tight inventories among axle suppliers means GM 's light truck plants would run out of parts about two days after a strike begins , analysts said .
A shutdown of light truck operations could cost GM $ 20 million a day in lost profits , analysts said.The American Axle talks have drawn attention because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract .
The UAW is trying to force the company to adopt the same pattern contract the Big Three automakers agreed to for about 400,000 UAW members last fall.Automakers guaranteed jobs for 95 percent of their current workforce in a contract that provides $ 2,000 lump sum payments in the first year and wage hikes of three percent in the second and third years .
The pact allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $ 19.The company claims the Big Three pattern would put it at a severe cost disadvantage with its competitors.A UAW strike against Johnson Controls Inc. , a key seat supplier for Ford , reached its 20th day Sunday with no settlement .
Bargaining between union and American Axle Manufacturing Inc. negotiators was expected to continue up to the midnight Friday deadline to avoid a strike that would quickly paralyse General Motors Corp. 's U.S. light truck production.About 7,200 United Auto Workers union members were ready to walk off the job at five plants in Detroit , Three Rivers , Mich. , and Buffalo , N.Y. , if no agreement was reached on a new three-year contract.American Axle , which was spun off from GM into a private company in 1994 , supplies virtually all of the rear axles for GM 's pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles , axles for the Camero and Firebird rear-drive cars , as well as various parts for other passenger car lines.The company also makes axles for Chrysler Corp. and axle shafts for Ford Motor Co.Tight inventories at American Axle and Dana Corp. , the other primary axle maker in the United States , means GM 's light truck plants would run out of parts by early next week , analysts said.They ca n't have more than two days supply because there is no excess capacity in the industry , said James Harbour , president of Harbour & amp ; Associates Inc. , a Troy , Mich.-based consulting firm.Burnham Securities Inc. analyst David Healy estimated GM could lose $ 20 million a day in after-tax profits if it was forced to suspend light truck production .
Labour strife cost the world 's largest automaker $ 1.2 billion in 1996.The American Axle situation is the latest labour dispute to flare up in the automotive supplier industry since the beginning of the year .
Analysts say they signal a new era as the UAW steps up efforts to organise more component workforces and bring pay levels in line with those of the Big Three.It 's the next phase of the evolution of change , said Donna Parolini , president of International Business Development Corp. , a Troy , Mich. supplier consulting firm.UAW membership among independent , or non-Big Three , suppliers has dropped dramatically over the last 20 years so that now less than 20 percent of the independent parts workers belong to the UAW , she said.The American Axle talks are notable because they mark the first time a GM spin-off has had to negotiate a new contract .
When the firm was spun off under former Chrysler manufacturing chief Richard Dauch , it agreed to uphold terms of the previous UAW contract , which expired last September.Union officials have said the company is balking at following the Big Three pattern deal hammered out last fall .
That contract guarantees employment for 95 percent of current workers , and allows automakers to pay new hires at 70 percent of the starting base hourly wage of about $ 19.Amrican Axle , however , wants to start new hires at 60 percent of the base wage -- and extend the time it takes to reach the full rate to six years .
The Big Three pact has a grow-in rate of three years.Last month , two Johnson Controls Inc. seat plants were hit with strikes by newly organised UAW workers .
As of the Friday an agreement had not been reached in the 18-day-old strike.The walkouts prompted Ford to take the unprecedented action of refusing to accept seats made by non-union replacements .
Ford later signed up Johnson Controls ' main competitor , Lear Corp. , to supply it with seats for the Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle , one of those affected by the strike.Parolini released figures Friday that showed the global supplier industry consolidating at a faster rate than previously thought .
By the end of this year , there will be about 8,000 suppliers -- down from 30,000 in 1988.In the past 22 months , there have been more than 320 acqusitions or mergers valued at a total of $ 32 billion .
The mergers will likely result in layoffs as the companies seek to gain efficiencies .
For instance , Parolini said companies such as Lear and Johnson Controls have issued internal mandates to reduce headcount by 20 percent next year .
Fearsome of injuries caused by deploying airbags , consumers polled by a market research firm gave safety a lower ranking when choosing a new vehicle for the first time in four years , according to a study released on Sunday.The biggest drop came with regard to airbags , which have been linked to the deaths of dozens of children and small adults by federal safety regulators.The number of people who gave driver and passenger side air bags a very important or important rating fell to 57 percent from 82 percent the previous year , according to the report conducted by the Dohring Co. Inc. , a Glendale , Calif.-based market research firm.Respondents who said those air bags are not at all important in their purchase decision jumped to 24 percent from 6 percent.No doubt the safety reports of physical injury have contributed to this , Rik Kinney , senior vice president of Dohring Co .
This is the first time since we started doing this study in 1993 that the importance of all safety-related equipment declined.Kinney said 96 percent of those surveyed had seen or heard media reports of potential injuries from airbags .
Harm to children ranked as the single biggest fear , with 45 percent of those listing that as a concern.The study was conducted in January 1997 from a random sample of 1,253 consumers in all 50 states .
The poll 's margin of error is 2.8 percent.In other findings , the Dohring study found the number of people who have purchased or will shop at a new car dealership have access to on-line information serivces was up 10 percent to 38 percent.But the study found that 81 percent of those talked to would still want to test drive a vehicle , even if they researched it over a computer on-line service .
Only 4 percent plan to use an on-line service to buy their vehicle.The study also found that 28 percent of the respondents would rather buy their next used car from a new car dealership that has a manufacturer 's certified program , vs. 15 percent who said they would go to a used car superstore.Kinney said the study was paid for by Dohring .
But he acknowledged the company receives 99 percent of its revenues from by selling research to automakers , dealer advertising associations and individual auto dealerships .
When thousands of auto dealers rolled into Las Vegas for their annual convention last year , there was much clamour over the looming onslaught of no-haggle superstores.As dealers prepare for this year 's gathering , which starts Saturday in Atlanta , the juggernaught is upon them.Republic Industries Inc. , the company controlled by billionaire investor Wayne Huizenga of Blockbuster Video fame , is on a buying spree that may have already made it the largest auto dealer group in the nation.Within two months , Republic , which includes the AutoNation USA superstore chain , has gone from owning no new-car franchises to six dealer groups.In the meantime , officials at CarMax , the auto superstore chain owned by Circuit City Stores Inc. , said earlier this month they would consider buying existing dealerships and adding more new-car outlets as part of their expansion plans.I think it 's got a lot of dealers rattled , said John Sinclair , owner of Sinclair Ford of Festus in Festus , Mo.The sweeping changes prompted industry trade magazine Automotive News to ask in its most recent edition : Apocalpyse Now ? Before its latest purchase , Montgomery Securities estimated Republic 's 1997 franchised dealership revenues at $ 2.5 billion .
That puts it ahead of the previous largest group , Hendrick Automotive Group , which has estimated 1997 revenues of $ 2.4 billion.The explosive growth of Republic , CarMax and others comes as Detroit 's Big Three automakers have backed off their traditional resistance to publicly owned dealerships.Ford Motor Co. Chairman Alex Trotman told dealers in Las Vegas a year ago that the No .
2 automaker had no plans to follow Chrysler Corp. and award a new car franchise to an auto superstore.But the automaker reversed its position in December when it formed an alliance with Republic that resulted in the sale of Ohio-based Mullinax Management , one of the country 's biggest Ford dealers , to Republic.Ford Chief Financial Officer John Devine said earlier this week the automaker still believes the private enterprise system is the best for the industry.But he added , We also have to recognise that changes are here and more changes are going to come.How profitable and successful the superstores ultimately become remains to be seen .
But in the short term , they are helping turn the tradition-bound retail car industry upside down .
Armed with capital , the auto superstores have taken sophisticated mass-market retail concepts honed in such places as consumer electronics stores and applied them to the new and used vehicle market.The results are huge lots of high-quality , pre-certified used cars .
Buyers who dread walking into an old-fashioned car dealerships enter the new superstores to find user-friendly computer kiosks and childrens ' play areas .
Salaried sales representatives offer low-pressure help , vehicles at no-haggle prices and 30-day bumper-to-bumper warranties.I think there 's going to be a revolution in the car business , Fred Ricart , owner of Ricart Ford in Columbus , Ohio , said earlier this month during a panel discussion at the Automotive News World Congress.Ricart , whose own dealership is structured in an auto mall format , believes traditional dealers can overcome their negative sterotypes and compete .
But he says they have to find new ways of improving and measuring customer loyalty and satisfaction.The advantage the superstores have is they 've got a clean slate going in , he said.The National Automobile Dealers Association 's 80th Annual Convention and Equipment Exposition will be held at the Georgia World Congress in Atlanta , from Feb. 1-4 .
When General Motors Corp. 's former Chairman Roger Smith forked over $ 5.1 billion for Hughes Aircraft Co. , he envisioned an industrial Goliath that would develop space-age technologies for every-day cars.Nearly 12 years the later , the verdict is mixed on Smith 's grand plan , analysts said Thursday.Raytheon Corp. 's agreement to purchase the Hughes defence operations is valued at $ 9.5 billion -- more than covering the original cost of the entire company bought from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in June 1985.If 100 percent of the Hughes-linked GM Class H stock were valued at Thursday 's closing stock price of just under $ 63 a share , Hughes would be worth $ 25.2 billion .
Under the structure before the proposed sale , about 25 percent of the Class H shares were traded publicly , with the rest held by GM.Financially , GM 's purchase of Hughes has paid off handsomely for the world 's largest automaker.But from the perspective of integrating Hughes and GM products , the experiment has not panned out , some analysts say.One attempt was a heads-up instrument display like those used on fighter jet cockpits that was incorporated into Oldsmobiles and Pontiacs -- but never went anywhere.The idea of synergistically combining aerospace technology into the automobile business , and applying GM 's advanced mass production technology to the high-cost aerospace business , was an idea straight out of cloud cuckoo-land and it never happened , said David Healy , an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.Roger Smith was a terrible manager but a great investor , Healy added.Analysts also pointed out that when GM 's industry dominance slipped in the mid-1980s , the money it tapped for Hughes was unavilable to sink into sorely needed new car and truck programmes.Indeed , Hughes Chairman C. Michael Armstrong acknowledged Wednesday that GM does not need to own Hughes to get the benefits of its radar and other aerospace technology.But other analysts argued that GM has reaped untold strategic benefits from Hughes that are not readily visible to outside observers .
One of the first benefits GM received was a vast improvement in its systems engineering capabilities , said David Cole , director of the University of Michigan 's Centre for the Study of Automotive Transportation.GM 's EV1 electric car , the industry 's first electric vehicle designed from the ground up , would not have been possible without Hughes ' Delco Electronics Corp. unit , which developed the inductive charging system , as well as the lead-acid batteries.Another Hughes product appearing on GM vehicles is the OnStar navigation and security system .
GM plans to offer the $ 895 optional system on vehicles outside its Cadillac division by the 1998 model year.Cole said there were numerous other applications for Hughes ' technology , including future electric vehicle platforms and other vehicles that incorporate hybrid technologies.Financially , it was excellent , said Cole .
The problem is that a lot of people outside do n't see the level of integration .
Ford Motor Co. Wednesday threatened to halt production at three plants in Michigan and Ohio if Johnson Controls Inc. and the United Auto Workers did not work out a solution to a nine-day strike.Ford 's action would idle about 6,800 hourly workers and suspend production of two of its best-selling and most profitable vehicles , the Expedition full-size sport utility and F-Series pickup trucks.Ford spokeswoman Francine Romine-MacBride said the automaker told UAW locals Wednesday afternoon if an agreement was not reached by Thursday , production would stop at the end of the regular afternoon shift that day.Plants that would be affected are in Wayne , Mich. , Lorain , Ohio , and Avon Lake , Ohio.About 500 UAW workers at two Johnson Controls plants walked off the job on Jan. 28 when talks broke down on a new contract with the Milwaukee-based company .
The plants , located in Plymouth , Mich. , and Oberlin , Ohio , make seats for the Expedition and Econoline and Club Wagon full-size vans.The action marks Ford 's most public and aggressive action to push the two sides toward a resolution since it refused to accept seats made by non-union replacements several hours after the strike began.David Healy , an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc , said Ford 's move could serve as a wake-up call for the union , but also could end up hurting the automaker 's first quarter earnings .
Ford makes about $ 10,000 before taxes on each Expedition , he said , and does not have much flexibility to recoup lost production.Ford is in a sense shooting itself in the foot , Healy said.Negotiations resumed Wednesday afternoon after breaking off Tuesday , Johnson Controls spokesman Jeff Steiner said.Thinking the strike would end quickly , Ford has been continuing to make Expeditions and Econolines with temporary seats and storing the vehicles in nearby lots .
By the end of production today , the company will have about 6,800 Expeditions and 6,300 Econolines without proper seats.Dealers had a 26-day supply of Expeditions on their lots at the end of January .
The industry typically considers a 60-day supply to be ideal.Ford officials expressed concern that Johnson Controls would have problems meeting Ford 's ongoing requirements in addition to catching up to Expeditions and Econolines already made.We really truly believed there would be an early settlement and that 's clearly not the case , Romine-MacBride said.In additions to Expeditions , Ford makes its popular F-Series pickups at truck plant in Wayne , where 4,000 UAW members work.The Lorain plant does final assembly of Econolines and Club Wagons .
About 1,500 workers would be affected by a shutdown .
Production of the Thunderbird and Cougar cars would be affected , although those lines already were idled for separate reasons.At the Avon Lake plant , which makes frames for the commercial vans , 1,300 workers would be affected .
Frame production of the Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest minivans would not be affected , Ford said.Ford officials declined to comment on how much the strike was likely to cost Ford.UAW spokesman Karl Mantyla declined to comment on Ford 's action .
Steiner at Johnson Controls said the company was aware of Ford 's position and was committed to settling the strike as soon as possible.The two sides were at odds over pay levels for a new contract .
The union says it wants the same hourly rate of $ 14 to $ 16 that competitors pay .
But Steiner said Johnson Controls has put forth a competitive offer.We feel we 've got a fair and reasonable package on the table that compares favourably to what the UAW has agreed to at other supplier plants , he said .
National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) investigators were preparing to examine the wreckage on Friday of a Delta Comair plane that crashed in a snowstorm on Thursday , killing all 29 people on board.The commuter plane , an Embraer Brasilia 120 en route to Detroit from Cincinnati , crashed in Raisinville Township about 25 miles ( 40 km ) southwest of Detroit.NTSB officials arrived in Michigan on Thursday and immediately set up a command post in Ann Arbor , which is near the site of the crash .
The wreckage was brought together under a tarpaulin to protect it from snow and was being guarded until the probe began.Investigators met early on Friday to plan strategy for the probe and were expected to begin combing the mangled wreckage later in the day.Cincinnati-based Comair , an independent carrier that flies commuter routes for Delta , said the 30-seat plane was carrying 26 passengers and three crew members.The three Cincinnati-based crew members were Captain Dann Carlsen , First Officer Kenneth Reece and Flight Attendant Darinda Ogden , Comair said in a statement early on Friday.The airline sent 30 members of its emergency response team to Michigan on Thursday , according to David Siebenburgen , President of Comair.They are there to assist the families , the NTSB and the FAA ( Federal Aviation Administration ) in any way they can during this ordeal , Siebenburgen said.A news conference was scheduled by the airline for 8:30 a.m. EST ( 1330 GMT ) at Cincinnati airport in Erlanger , Ky.Flight 3272 had been cleared for approach to Detroit Metropolitan Airport when air traffic controllers lost radar contact , Comair Senior Vice President of Marketing Charles Curran told a news briefing on Thursday .
No distress signals were sent , he said.Comair said the plane has been with the company since February 1992 and had its most recent maintenance checkup on Nov. 20 , 1996 .
The airline denied an earlier report the plane had been grounded two days earlier for rudder problems.Witnesses told local television crews the plane 's engines made a sputtering sound before it crashed into the ground at a sharp angle .
The plane exploded into a fireball that sent a black mushroom cloud into the air that left just pieces of the twin-prop airliner.The area and much of the region had been hit by a storm which dumped six inches ( 15 cm ) or more of snow .
While air traffic was snarled in Chicago and other cities there was no confirmation that weather played a role in the crash.In October 1994 icing caused a French-built American Eagle ATR-72 to crash in northern Indiana , killing all 68 on board .
The plane 's manufacturer later made revisions to de-icing equipment.CNN reported that the Brazilian-made Embraer-120 has been involved in 13 other crashes since 1986 where lives were lost , including an accident in Georgia that killed former Senator John Tower .
One year after Chrysler Corp. stunned traditional car dealers by granting a new car franchise to the CarMax auto superstore chain , a senior Chrysler executive said Sunday the move has been a success.We think Car Max represents us well , said Tom Pappert , vice president of sales and service for Chrysler.Pappert , who spoke to reporters at the National Automobile Dealers Association annual convention here , said competing dealers near the Norcross , Ga. , Chrysler/Dodge CarMax dealership have begun to emulate many of CarMax 's practices such as money-back guarantees and more generous warranties.It takes all of the guess work out of the used car process , and that 's exactly what needs to happen , he said , noting the dealership has added new business and not stolen it from other Chrysler dealers.Chrysler , the first of Detroit 's Big Three to ally itself with one of the new superstores , has no plans to expand any more with CarMax , Pappert said .
CarMax is a unit of Circuit City Stores Inc..Like other automakers , Chrysler has a limit on the number of separate dealership storefronts a single owner can have , although exceptions are granted .
The company limits owners to 10 separate dealerships in the country , six in a given regional sales zone , and two in a metropolitan area.But Chrysler has adopted some of the superstore techniques at three new facilities being built in Texas , Maryland and Massachusetts .
The stores will give as much exposure to used cars as new cars typically get .
They will be set up in a mall-type layout and feature a personal greeter , child playrooms and a cafe.The superstore concept , as well as dealerships owned by publicly traded companies , have been a source of concern voiced by dealers attending the convention , according to officials at both Chrysler and Ford Motor Co..However , Pappert said the capital that publicly traded companies have access to can help dealers who find their profits squeezed by increasingly thin margins.Profits are likely to come under even more pressure as more buyers use the Internet to research and purchase vehicles , said Pappert .
He cited a Boston Consulting group study that forecast 25 percent of new vehicle sales will be over the Internet by 2000 , adding he believes it will be higher than that.It 's going north -- not south , Pappert said.Separately , Ford Division General Manager Ross Roberts said the automaker has had discussions superstore groups , but has not reached any other letters of understanding like the agreement it signed recently with Republic Industries Inc. , which owns the AutoNation USA chain.Under the agreement announced in December , AutoNation can submit proposals to acquire existing Ford or Lincoln-Mercury dealerships .
The pact also covers areas that Ford does not have dealerships and wants to start one.Roberts said Ford has talked with large groups that do not meet the automaker 's financial , territorial and cooperative standards .
Britain 's Bass plc has added to its already substantial holdings in the Czech Republic by increasing its stake in the northeastern brewer Pivovar Radegast a.s..Radegast Director Jan Sikora told Reuters on Tuesday that Bass had raised its stake in the Czech firm by about 10 percent to 30.07 percent , but would not say from whom the stake was purchased.The CTK news agency , quoting unnamed sources , reported earlier on Tuesday that Bass had purchased 9.97 percent of Radegast from Raiffeisen Capital and Investment Praha.But Raiffeisen and Bass officials said they were unable to confirm the report .
Sikora would not disclose any further details of the sale.The Prague-based bank Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. is Radegast 's largest shareholder with a 34 percent stake while a fund managed by the investment arm of the Czech insurer Ceska Pojistovna , holds 30 percent.In July , Bass took an initial 20 percent stake in Radegast , one of the country 's four largest brewers , augmenting Bass 's Czech portfolio which includes a majority stake in the Prague Breweries ( Prazske Pivovary ) and two smaller provincial brew houses.Since acquiring shares in the Prague Breweries , makers of the flagship lager Staropramen , in 1993 , Bass has moved agressively to market Czech beer , namely Staropramen , abroad and especially in Britain.Bass has said it hopes to integrate their Czech operations with the other breweries which have merged with the Prague plant.Radegast , which brews a popular lager with the same name and which was a major sponsor of the Czech national football team in the European championship , is based near the northeastern city of Ostrava.Over the first nine months of 1996 , the firm posted a gross profit of some 281.5 million crowns , up from 230 million for the same period in 1995 .
The often-praised Czech economy may be starting to show cracks , as slower growth highlights concern over a widening trade gap and the pace of industrial restructuring , analysts said on Monday.Over the years , economists have hailed Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and his policies which have produced one of the lowest inflation rates in the region , good GDP growth and an unemployment rate of about three percent.Many of those same analysts , however , are now saying that while the economy is not yet in serious trouble , much remains to be done , particularly in industrial restructuring.The latest round of bad news came on Monday , when the Czech Statistical Bureau released figures showing the trade balance finished 1996 with a record deficit of 160.33 billion crowns ( $ 5.75 billion ) , up from a 95.7 billion crown shortfall the previous year.While most economists , after several mid-year revisions , had predicted the deficit , some are beginning to voice concerns over Czech industry 's export competitiveness.As far as the export of our raw materials and semi-finished products are concerned , ( the development ) is very unfavourable over the last year , Kamil Janacek , chief economist at Komercni Banka said.We are undergrowing competition from other transforming economies .
More and more we are unable to compete with some semi-finished products from Ukraine , for example , having in mind the average cost level with the Czech Republic , he added.Since 1992 the economy has moved from recession to 4.8 percent consumption-driven real growth in 1995 , as inflation fell from double digits to below nine percent.Unemployment remains around three percent , and official statistics say nearly 70 percent of the economy is made by companies in , at least nominally , private hands.Most Czechs are fully employed , buying truckloads of western goods , and living in state-controlled housing.But real economic growth has begun to wane , with third quarter GDP slowing to 3.6 percent , year-on-year , from 4.0 percent growth in the second quarter.And the spiralling trade deficit has put pressure on the current account , which showed a deficit of $ 3.1 billion crowns for the first three quarters according to the latest figures , while the capital account was in surplus by some $ 2.0 billion.Most analysts agree that a flood of funds since the beginning of the year -- an estimated 25-30 billion crowns have entered the country in crown-denominated Eurobonds alone -- should keep the situation from deteriorating this year.And , they add , foreign reserves are adequate.But , said Janacek : The problem is if in the medium-term a continuing current account deficit of about eight percent of GDP is financeable or not.Boris Gomez of ING Barings said one problem is the lack of reliable data to chart whether the wave of imports , spurred mainly by raw material and machinery imports , will translate into economic restructuring.He expects exports to become stronger this year as key west European markets wake up from their recent slumber , and other central European economies gain strength.The key period will be the end of this year when the trade deficit will have to have stabilised or there will be a lot of pressure , he said.Added one London-based economist : You can get all of the imports you want , but then you have to do something with them.There are a lot of people who talk about how this ( the imports ) will help down the road , but the assumption here is huge -- that management actually knows what it is doing with all of its structural advantages , he said .
( $ 1=27.86 Czech Crown ) The Czech Republic took both reverse singles matches from India on Sunday clinching a berth in the second round of the Davis Cup , but lost its number one player , Petr Korda in the process.Jiri Novak gave the Czechs a 3-2 victory with a straight set 6-1 6-4 6-3 victory over Mahesh Bhupathi after Korda , who announced he was retiring from Davis Cup play , had brought his team level with a 5-7 6-3 6-4 6-1 win over Leander Paes.Novak barely broke a sweat against Bhupathi , who is ranked more than 400 places lower , needing just 90 minutes to dispatch the Indian number two.Jumping out to a quick start , Novak , ranked 67th in the world , took the first set 6-1 and went up 5-0 in the second before losing his rythmn , and four consecutive games .
But he regrouped to hold serve in the tenth game for the set.He then broke Bhupathi twice in the third set to clinch the tie .
This is one of the biggest matches I have won in my life , said an elated Novak following the match.Korda , ranked 33rd in the world , also had little trouble in his matchup with Paes , overpowering the Indian at the net and unleashing powerful groundstrokes from the baseline.He squandered five break points in the first set , while Paes , ranked 105th in the world , took advantage of the only one he had to take the first set in 53 minutes.But Korda showed no signs of a cold that has plagued him throughout the week , quickly getting back on track to take the next three sets.Overall though , I am still really happy both myself and the team performed , said Olympic bronze medalist Paes.After the win , Korda said he would no longer play for the Czechs in the Davis Cup , complaining of the demands it put on a player.There was a lot of pressure on me for this match , but I showed the kind of player I am , he said.I have thought about retiring ( from Davis Cup ) for a while and it 's time to leave .
It is a very tiring , draining experience and I think you should leave at the top .
Now is the right time.Korda , who was once ranked as high as fifth in the world , has been the anchor of the Czech team since his debut in 1988 , compiling a 30-12 overall record , including three wins against India this weekend.The loss of Korda is the second setback for last year 's semifinalists , after Czech number two Daniel Vacek bowed out of action to concentrate more on his performance on the ATP tour .
Czech trading firms saw the trade deficit nearly doubling , year-on-year , in the first quarter of 1997 , while analysts said the figures were in line with forecasts and the crown firmed on the news.A survey of importers and exporters by the Czech Statistical Bureau ( CSU ) , released on Wednesday , showed the trade deficit should rise to about 45 billion crowns ( $ 1.6 billion ) for the quarter , up from a 27.1 billion crown gap for the first quarter 1996.Analysts said the survey figures were realistic given the January shortfall of 13.6 billion crowns , adding the first quarter was usually a slow period for trade and the deficit should grow substantially after the quarter.It 's more or less in line with our forecasts , but I think the deficit situation will gradually worsen throughout the year , Martin Kupka , an economist at Patria Finance told Reuters.The CSU itself has issued a forecast for the overall 1997 trade deficit to rise to between 211-219 billion crowns after last year 's record shortfall of 160.3 billion crowns , but it has not issued its own quarterly estimate.The CSU said in a statement the survey included estimates from firms which accounted for 20 percent of all import business last year , and 36 percent of exports.It said 170 firms were polled in the survey , of which 67 percent responded.The real question lies in how much the deficit will accelerate after the first quarter , said one London-based analyst .
Last year we saw a sharp increase in the pace of growth in the deficit and if that occurs again , it could be a problem.The survey showed total imports were expected to rise in the first quarter by some 10 percent , year-on-year , with raw materials , foodstuffs and machinery imports accounting for most of the growth .
Total imports in the first quarter of 1996 were 174.3 billion crowns.Import prices were expected to edge about two percent higher overall , though prices of chemicals and related products , beverages and tobacco should ease slightly.It said total exports for the quarter should remain static at last year 's 147.2 billion crown level .
Export prices should rise by about 2.5 percent , year-on-year.Ironically , the forecast reassured the foreign exchange ( forex ) market , after the crown lost ground on reports that several German banks were expecting a weakening of the currency and were not recommending clients to buy Czech state debt.Forex dealers said the crown fell by as much as 50 basis points against its dollar/mark basket midpoint because of the reports , but recovered some 30 basis points to 3.55 percent above the midpoint , or 28.430 to the dollar and 17.017 to the mark after the forecast.I think 45 billion crowns is the amount that probably all economists were expecting ... The crown began to rebound right after the forecast was released , said Jiri Ubry of ING Bank .
( $ = 28.46 Czech Crowns ) The Czech crown , battered down by central bank comments in recent days , rebounded on Friday bolstered by a wave of foreign currency selling though dealers cautioned the market remains very nervous.In late afternoon trading , the crown was at 4.70 percent above its mark/dollar basket parity , up more than 50 basis points from the open but still some 80 basis points from Tuesday 's record fixing at +5.51.Some bigger foreign players pushed the crown up , selling hard currency for crowns , said Jiri Ubry of ING Bank.Added Martin Strauch of Citibank : There were some break-even sellers in the market and the crown has now rebounded to near its peak before the central bank 's comments.One of post-Communist Europe 's most stable currencies , the crown has consistently reached record highs in recent weeks , fuelled by demand brought about from a wave of more than 30 billion crowns in Eurobond issues since the start of the year.But the market made an about face on Wednesday after the central bank said it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary.The crown fell over 200 basis points against parity as many London traders bailed out over the next two days.Petr Korous of bank CSOB said some profit taking was also pushing the crown higher , and that there still appeared to be a large number of traders with long positions of hard currency against Czech crowns that may now sell off.When there were these comments from the central bank , a couple of big players may have bought hard currency because they had never held a long position before and got nervous , Korous said.It looks like now they are slightly losing patience and getting rid of their positions at slightly higher than what we saw just three days ago , he added.Dealers said they have seen few indications that the central bank was again on the verge of intervening , adding that they did not expect any action since the crown was not likely to rise above the five percent parity level.The CNB has not intervened directly on the market since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent.Few dealers predicted the crown would rise much further since the market was so nervous , but noted the crown appeared to have good support at around 4.5 percent above parity.It 's tough to predict the crown 's direction right now becuase it 's so volatile in relation to any comments about it , said Citibank 's Strauch.Korous also noted that the current stalemate in parliament where the ultra-right Republican and Communist opposition deputies have used stalling tactics to drag out debate for four days over a sensitive post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany could create more instability.I feel that we wo n't go to the levels we saw recently because there is some nervousness over the political scene here , especially when the ruling politicians have no idea how to eliminate the obstructions they are causing , he said .
The Czech crown fell sharply on Thursday following central bank comments that it was not satisfied with the currency 's recent rise , but dealers said the crown remains attractive and should stabilise by week 's end.One of post-Communist Europe 's most stable currencies , the crown has consistently reached record highs in recent weeks , fuelled by demand brought about from a wave of more than 30 billion crowns in Eurobond issues since the start of the year.But while the crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket trading at 3.48 percent above parity , it was down over 60 basis points from its opening and some 200 points lower from Tuesday 's record fixing at +5.51.Analysts said , however , that the country 's high interest rate differential and the country 's overall economic stability should limit any further drop.For this week , we may see the crown slightly weaker , but the crown is still very attractive and I do not see space for much furthening weaking of it , said Jiri Becvar of BNP-Dresdner in Prague.The central bank 's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent , while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June.The fall comes on the heels of Wednesday 's comment by the central bank it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary.Intervention ( on the market ) is our normal instrument , and we can use it whenever we are not satisfied ( with the crown 's exchange rate ) , CNB spokesman Martin Svehla told Reuters.The other question is whether we are satisfied ?
You heard ( CNB ) governor ( Josef Tosovsky ) saying there is 'no reason ' for the crown to be like this .
It signals that the central bank is not fully satisfied with this development , he added.He declined to elaborate , and said these were just general comments.Breta Tichanek of ING Barings said he expected the crown to trade within the range plus four to plus five percent from the basket midpoint throughout the day.I think it 's partially because of yesterday 's comment ( by the CNB ) and the closing of some postions and speculative flows , he said.The depth of the fall also took the market by surprise initially , with many dealers saying they had been prepared for an early attack on +4.25 percent , but expected London dealers to take profits and then stabilise.In fact there were new buyers after some brief consolidation and the index dropped to +3.45 , said Petr Korous of CSOB.There are a lot of long positions and they have to be covered so the market may squeeze them .
If there is nothing special I am very sceptical that we can see the crown index weaken much more than to around +3.00 , he added.Some crown dealers have said the central bank had been putting out feelers in the market recently , though most did not expect to see any intervention , especially after the weakening on Thursday.The CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent .
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has thrown his support behind the creation of an independent market regulator , but analysts said on Monday it will take more than that to revive confidence in the embattled Prague bourse.Klaus , speaking after a meeting on financial market regulation on Sunday , said the market was moving from its first phase , when it was created under the mass voucher privatisation programme of 1992-95 , towards becoming a standard market.He added that everybody understood that this process would happen gradually.But analysts and traders said that while the moves are a welcome start , only concrete results will now be able to lure investors back to the market.It shows a trend that the government knows there is a problem and is working on solutions , said Jan Sykora , a broker at Wood and Company.But confidence in the Czech market has been decimated and there is a strong lack of confidence , especially among foreign investors ... who now want to see real results , and not just proclamations.Added Radim Bajgar of ING Barings : It 's positive , but we have heard these announcements before -- results will be the best medicine for the market.While markets in Poland and Budapest have posted solid gains this year , the Prague Stock Exchange has sputtered , especially since the beginning of September when a bear run triggered by a foreign investor selloff took some 20 percent out of the ailing bourse.These investors , and some local players , have been highly critical of the lack of transparency on Czech markets , and particularly about the failure of the Securites Centre , where the overwhelming majority of trades are registered , to release detailed price information.A lot international clients shudder when you mention the Czech market .
They just do n't know what real prices here are because so little information comes from the Securities Centre , where so much of the trading occurs , said one fund manager.Until now , Klaus has showed little enthusiasm for a plan by PSE Chairman Tomas Jezek to create a body modelled on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .Klaus has long believed market regulation , now conducted by a department in the Finance Ministry , should be minimal.But he capitulated on Sunday , saying there is a dominant opinion that there is little transparency on the our capital market.As a long-term solution we want to create an independent capital supervision ( body ) .
That requires legislation and an number of other things , said Klaus following the meeting.He also announced that all prices of OTC deals registered at the central securities centre ( SCP ) would be published from February 1 .
He gave no indication of whether the names of buyers and sellers would also be released.Jezek wants to create a Czech SEC by 1998 but Klaus gave no indication of when he thought it could be set up.Klaus said that as a first step the market supervision department of the Finance Ministry would be transformed into a Securities Bureau also from February 1 , 1997.It would remain under the ministry but would have more staff and an 11-member advisory commission for the bureau would also be set up including market participants .
The bureau would intensify control of investment funds and companies , he said.Analysts said that once more regulation did find its way to the market , those same investors who have shunned Czech shares will probably return.Because most foreign investors have such a poor view of this market , they are under-invested here .
So once you start to create better conditions , you should see it translate into a strong positive trend next year , Sykora said. -- Prague Newsroom , 42-2-2423-0003 The United States on Tuesday upped the ante in the battle to supply NATO aspirants in central Europe with advanced fighter aircraft , by offering the Czechs free use of seven Navy Hornet aircraft for five years.Representatives of the U.S. Navy , on behalf of the U.S. Government offered to lease the Czech Republic seven McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighter planes under a no-cost , five-year agreement , McDonnell Douglas said in a statement.The offer ( to the Czech government ) is for the no-cost , five-year leasing of six single-seat F/A-18A and one two-seat F/A-18B aircraft , said the statement , issued by the Prague representative of McDonnell Douglas Corp .The offer included the supply , at cost , of replacement parts , pilot and ground personnel training programmes and support equipment.Also competing for post-Cold War business in central Europe are U.S. Lockheed Martin , which makes F-16 's primarily for the U.S. airforce , the Anglo-Swedish consortium of SAAB and British Aerospace , which makes the Gripen , and France 's Dassault Aviation makers of the Mirage.It was not yet clear whether the aircraft in the U.S. offer would be used or new , and the Prague spokesman for McDonnell Douglas was not immediately available for further comment.Supply and service costs will be the subject of further discussions , the statement said.Czech pilots could begin training in the planes in six months , with delivery of the aircraft 18 months after the contract is signed , the statement said.To strengthen its bid , McDonnell Douglas also said that it is preparing to locate production of components for the Hornet at Czech light jet maker Aero Vodochody a.s. regardless of whether new or leased aircraft are chosen to re-equip the Czech Air Force.Cooperation could also include Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s. , it added.The Czech government , seeking to prepare for eventual membership in NATO , has been debating decisions on buying any aircraft as proposed cuts in defence spending have clouded the debate over the upgrading of the fleet.The Czechs , along with Poland and Hungary , are seen as leading candidates for early NATO membership , when the western security alliance expands.Czech defence officials have said they have the will but not the wallet to buy brand new western-made advanced fighters , but are keeping their options open as a battle over the long-term military budget goes on.They have said they would need about 24 fighters to replace their ageing Soviet made MiG-21s to be more compatible with NATO , but at more than $ 20 million per fighter , new western planes are too pricey .

The Czech Statistical Bureau ( CSU ) issued forecasts for 1997 on Monday predicting a slight economic upturn , but analysts issued warnings about the rapidly growing trade and current account deficits.After a sluggish 1996 , the CSU said it expected real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth for 1997 of 4.0-5.0 percent following an estimated 4.1 percent in 1996 .
Average annual inflation should ease to 7.5-8.0 percent from 8.8 percent , it forecast.The CSU added in its wide range of forecasts that the current account deficit , spurred by a spiralling trade gap , should grow to 137-145 billion crowns from an estimated 110.6 billion crown ( $ 4 billion ) shortfall in 1996.Analysts said the figures were more or less in line with expectations , but said that the widening current account and trade deficits -- both seen growing to record levels in 1997 -- could undermine the economy.I think they are credible forecasts , but not very encouraging , said David Lubin , an economist at HSBC Midland.It 's okay for a country to run a current account deficit of nine percent of GDP but only if you believe in the future the economy will generate trade surpluses big enough to repay the debt that 's being accumulated to finance the deficits , he told Reuters.According to the CSU estimates , the current account shortfall should be 8.6-9.1 percent of GDP in 1997 .
It forecast the trade deficit would widen to 202-212 billion crowns from a deficit of 160.3 billion last year.At the heart of the trade gap was a 12.7 percent rise in imports in 1996 , due largely to firms investing in new machinery and materials which are badly needed for post-communist economic restructuring.Exports stagnated , rising only 3.5 percent for the year .
But the CSU said it expected them to grow 4.5-6.5 percent in 1997 , while import growth should ease slightly to 9-12 percent.Some improvement ( in imports ) can be expected only in the second half of 1997 due to the influence of investment in new technologies and some pro-export measures , the CSU said.But analysts say it is still too soon to know if the vast imports of machinery and materials in 1996 will be properly put to use , and whether managers can make their new capital goods translate into a more competitive industrial sector and cover the deficit currently being run up.I 'm not sure that the Czech economy is making sufficient progress at the corporate level , the micro-economic level , to generate those trade surpluses , said one local economist.It seems to me that the Czech economy still has a sort of fundamental competitiveness problem , he added.After fighting through a recent downturn , the Czech Republic 's largest trading partner , Germany , appears poised to make a recovery in 1997 .
Government officials have often said that this should help sagging Czech exports.But if the German economy does warm up , the Bundesbank may raise interest rates to keep it from overheating , attracting back funds which have flooded into the Czech Republic and bolstered its capital account.What they gain on the current account on the balance of payments from the German upturn , they might lose somewhat on the capital account , Lubins said.The CSU said growth in average nominal wages -- a factor the central bank has said must be brought under control if inflation targets are to be met -- is expected to be 14.5-16.5 percent , down from the 1996 forecast increase of 18.4 percent.Some analysts , however , said the drop might not be enough to stem inflationary pressures.This ( wage growth ) is much more than this economy can afford -- maybe around 12 percent is acceptable , said Vladimir Kriedl , an economist at Patria Finance. -- Prague Newsroom , 42-2-2423-0003 ( $ = 27.65 Czech Crowns ) China is pressing ahead with a controversial plan to roll back civil rights and democracy in Hong Kong , with its tough line on the territory unshaken by the death of leader Deng Xiaoping.Deng , who died last week , was the architect of the one country two systems formula for the conversion of Hong Kong into a special , autonomous capitalist zone of China when British rule ends at midnight on June 30.Despite widespread misgivings about China in this bustling territory of 6.4 million people , thousands of residents paid respects to Deng for the fourth day on Monday in a mourning ceremony at China 's official mission.On Sunday night , China 's parliament approved a plan to throw out or amend a clutch of Hong Kong laws , including those that provide for democratic elections and protect civil liberties.The plan trims back a bill of rights , a law on forming political parties and another on free association which takes a liberal approach to public protests and demonstrations.The laws were part of London 's effort to create a democratic framework in Hong Kong in the twilight of more than 150 years of British rule.Beijing has justified its onslaught against Hong Kong 's fledgling democracy by accusing Britain of treaty violations with Hong Kong 's recent democratic reforms.China 's latest move means the die is now very much cast , a spokesman for the Hong Kong Democratic Party told Reuters in reference to the National People 's Congress 's ( NPC ) Sunday decision.China has shown it is not going to respect the will of Hong Kong people .
The NPC is a political body making a decision that will remake Hong Kong in blatant breach of handover agreements which say Hong Kong 's laws shall remain unchanged.He said the move violated both the internationally registered 1984 Sino-British handover treaty , known as the Joint Declaration , as well as Hong Kong 's future constitution , the Basic Law.Beijing 's move to crimp basic freedoms flies in the face of official protests by Britain.London has challenged China to go to the World Court to seek a ruling on the legality of Beijing 's plan to replace Hong Kong 's elected Legislative Council with an appointed provisional legislature.In a related development , a leading Hong Kong member of the Preparatory Committee on the handover told reporters Hong Kong would not be allowed to amend new election rules that the panel was preparing for the territory.Neither Hong Kong 's leader-in-waiting , Tung Chee-hwa , the provisional legislature , nor the post-colonial government , could change the rules , Lau Siu-kai said.Slightly over half of Preparatory Committee members are from Hong Kong and the rest are from the mainland .
Its decisions generally echo policy statements by senior Beijing officials.The rules would govern the first election of a long-term legislature some time in 1998 to replace a provisional body that China has appointed to make laws from July 1.It had not been clear how much say Hong Kong people would have in setting the rules.A Hong Kong business leader and pro-China politician set to join Tung 's Executive Council said the cabinet would play a much greater role in policy making than it had done under outgoing colonial Governor Chris Patten.But the businessman , Henry Tang , head of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries , also said he expected no big policy changes under Tung , a Shanghai-born shipping billionaire .
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind flies into a political quarrel this weekend over the future of Hong Kong 's democratic elections and human rights laws , which China plans to roll back after taking over in July.Tempers flared this week as Tung Chee-hwa , Hong Kong 's future leader appointed by China , attacked the territory 's Democratic Party , which he said had blackened Hong Kong 's name by spreading doomsday forecasts.Rifkind is due to arrive on Saturday night for what may be his last visit before Britain hands the territory back to China .
He will meet Tung and lawmakers during his three days in the colony , placing himself in the crossfire but possibly taking sides versus Tung.Public opinion has been turning against Tung due to his increasingly authoritarian policy statements.Though highly popular immediately after his December appointment , a poll last week showed his approval rating had shrunk to 58.5 percent from 64.6 percent a month earlier , falling behind colonial Governor Chris Patten , who scored 59.1 percent.There has been a palpable shift in the public mood , the Far Eastern Economic Review noted in an editorial.Not only is there public disquiet and growing unease about him in the public service , but doubts are now simmering among foreign businessmen based in Hong Kong about the way the place is to be run from July , said the Economist magazine.This is just the beginning .
The way things are going , Tung Chee-hwa and his government-in-waiting will be running out of popularity long before July 1 , pro-democracy lawmaker Margaret Ng wrote in a newspaper column on Friday.Mr Tung 's ship of state is charting a decidedly retrogressive course , she wrote .
Confidence may yet be restored provided this paranoia about democracy is put aside.Tung 's recent endorsement of a Beijing-backed move to dilute civil rights freedoms in Hong Kong was likely to incite protests , said political analyst Andy Ho .
Some back-peddling on the part of Mr Tung ... may well be the best dose of medicine to defuse current political tension.In Singapore on Thursday , Rifkind lashed out at China 's plans to install an appointed legislature in place of the elected Legco , and the steps to whittle down civil liberties.People have enjoyed a wide range of basic political rights .
Any diminution of these rights will ... have significant consequences for the confidence in the territory and for its economic success , Rifkind said.Last year British officials , praising Tung 's integrity , viewed him as a benign choice to lead the bustling capitalist territory of 6.3 million people and hoped he would form a dream team with popular incumbent civil service chief Anson Chan.But now , with all his support for authoritarian changes , they must be wondering , almost aloud , if Mr Tung is n't going to be a nightmare , a political analyst said.Tung 's attacks on Democratic Party leader Martin Lee provoked critical editorials in Hong Kong daily newspapers.The independent Ming Pao said Lee , on a tour of Europe to lobby for support against China 's planned rollback of Hong Kong freedoms , had been forced to go to the West for support.It said Tung had ostracised Lee 's party -- Hong Kong 's most popular -- and that if he did n't want Democrats to voice their views abroad , he should include them in more of the decision-making on the territory 's future.The popular Apple Daily said Tung was trying to mimic authoritarian Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and it asked why Tung was so afraid of criticism.But the daily Wen Wei Po , a local mouthpiece for Beijing 's Communist Party , applauded Tung and said freedom of speech should not extend to opinions that harm Hong Kong 's interests .
Hong Kong 's Democratic Party leaders , often seen as the arch-foes of Beijing , launched a marathon mission to North America and Europe on Wednesday to brief the West on the territory 's plight as China takes over.Britain hands the colony for over 150 years back to Beijing at midnight on June 30 , and the Democratic Party has been in the forefront of political clashes with China over Chinese plans to curb democracy and civil rights laws in Hong Kong.Party leader Martin Lee and his deputy Szeto Wah , a leading anti-communist activist , would lead the mission to the United States , Canada and the United Nations offices in Switzerland .
Fellow legislator Andrew Cheng would also be going.The three will speak to audiences in Seattle , Vancouver , Calgary , Los Angeles , Sacramento , San Francisco , Boston , Chicago , Toronto , Washington , New York , Ottawa and Geneva.The tour is the biggest ever undertaken by the Hong Kong democratic movement 's beacon organisation to convince Western opinion of the need to help safeguard the territory 's basic freedoms after communist-ruled China takes over.Lee is sharply at odds both with China and with its pick for Hong Kong 's future leader , Tung Chee-hwa .
Tung has accused Lee of being anti-China and of badmouthing Hong Kong by spreading doom scenarios about the territory 's furture.Our goal is to emphasise the vital importance of Hong Kong as the economic and trade centre of the Pacific Rim , Lee said as he left Hong Kong for Seattle late on Tuesday.We will detail latest developments in Hong Kong and their implications for the future .
I intend to give a clear , realistic picture of the situation here and encourage the American and Canadian people to take a close interest now and in the future.In a move certain to anger China , Lee will testify to the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva on April 7 , where he said he plans to discuss the threats to freedom , civil rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong.China plans to roll back liberal laws on the freedom of association , which includes rules on forming political parties , and on freedom of assembly , which covers rules on political demonstrations , as well as Hong Kong 's Bill of Rights.Beijing says the moves are needed because the liberalisation of the political scene in recent years breaches understandings reached with Britain and formal agreements on the handover.Lee said he would also raise China 's plan to dissolve Hong Kong 's elected Legislative Council upon the handover and replace it with an appointed body composed of pro-China politicians.He would argue that Hong Kong 's continued economic success and freedoms were inseparable from its political freedoms.With 19 seats , Lee 's is the largest party in the 60-member legislature .
It was in the vanguard of a victory for democratic groups who took 70 percent of the vote in free democratic polls in 1995 .
Pro-China parties were rejected at the polls.Lee said he would also lobby Washington to renew China 's most favoured nation trading status when it comes up for review this year .
Hong Kong benefits substantially from China 's trading privileges because the bulk of the trade goes via Hong Kong.In Washington on April 1-2 , Lee will address the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and governmental and congressional leaders and he would lobby for visa-free access to the United States by Hong Kong people after the Chinese takeover .
The mission was also intended to raise funds for the Hong Kong Democratic Party -- in what may be the last year when this is legally possible if China goes ahead as it intends and bans links between Hong Kong parties and overseas organisations.The party would address overseas Chinese communities , think tanks , business leaders and legal and human rights groups.After visiting Geneva Lee will return in Washington on April 9 to receive one of the country 's most prestigious political awards , the National Endowment for Democracy 's 1997 Democracy Award.Previous recipients include Czechoslovak dissident-turned- President Vaclav Havel and rights campaigner Yelena Bonner , the wife of late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov .
Human rights and political liberty took centre stage in Hong Kong on Tuesday as human rights watchdogs said China was making it easier to crush dissent , boding ill for the territory after Beijing takes over.After 156 years under the British flag , Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 -- 63 days away -- and the pace of politics is quickening.The watchdog Human Rights Watch/Asia said changes to China 's criminal code had made it easier for Beijing to stifle dissent , and Hong Kong people might even be put on trial in China.In Washington , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks on contentious issues but there was no shift in views on human rights or the future of Hong Kong , a Chinese spokesman said.A major public consultation on the future of political freedom in the colony ends on Wednesday , and the bustling capitalist outpost 's 6.4 million people are sharply divided.The pulse-taking launched by future leader Tung Chee-hwa asks members of the public and organisations to submit views on his plan to ban foreign funding of political groups and curb the right to protest in the interests of national security.Pro-democracy parties , the legal profession , human rights groups , Western-style trade unions and churches have all vigorously objected to the plan in written submissions , and there has been loud criticism from London and Washington.But organisations representing industry , commerce , pro-China political parties and pro-Beijing trade unions support Tung 's plan , which was forced on him in March by a Chinese parliamentary resolution.In the latest twist , a powerful pro-Beijing labour group , the Federation of Trade Unions , urged a widening of definitions of political groups covered by the curbs.But in an unusual move , the federation also called for a ban on funding from China 's ruling Communist Party to local political groups to be added to the restrictions.This will avoid disputes and criticisms .
Hong Kong 's political groups should stand on their own feet to fight for their beliefs , said the union 's boss , Cheng Yiu-tong.Cheng 's rival , pro-democracy trade union federation leader Lee Cheuk-yan , attacked Cheng 's bid to widen the net .
( It ) is a step backward , because they want to have more organisations defined as political groups , Lee told Reuters .
They want to pressure these organisations to depoliticise.Tung 's future Justice Secretary , Elsie Leung , said she was willing to consider calls for a ban on mainland funding.Such funding had not originally been mentioned because it was considered that the national security interests of Hong Kong and mainland organisations converged.But we will consider this proposal as so many people have raised it , she said at a function on Monday.Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a major report on Tuesday that China 's striking of the term counterrevolution , the communist code for subversion , from the law books in March did not mean easing political controls .
Quite the opposite.China has merely replaced the term 'counterrevolution ' with the equally elastic notion of 'endangering state security ' and has , in the process , actually broadened the capacity of the state to suppress dissent , the report said.Hong Kong people , who China has vowed can keep their legal system and way of life for 50 years , could suffer , it said.The new security provisions will facilitate the labelling of all domestic critics as tools of 'hostile foreign forces ' , it said .
Despite Hong Kong 's separate legal system , Beijing may have the power to bring Hong Kong people to face trial in mainland courts .
Hong Kong 's Finance Secretary Donald Tsang , set to unveil the annual budget under China 's watchful eye , is a man of conservative pedigree when it comes to economics but an outspoken liberal in the political arena.Tsang , who appears in hallmark striped business shirts and colourful bow-ties , broke a 153-year colonial mould by becoming Hong Kong 's first non-British financial secretary in 1995 , crowning a 30-year career in the civil service.So far , he has made no stunning changes to the cautious budget policies that have made Hong Kong rich , a posture that should endear him to Hong Kong 's soon-to-be sovereign power , China.The 52-year-old staunch Roman Catholic minces no words when he advertises his cautious , conservative economic approach.My policy is not to create excitement in the management of our public finances , nor do I have any appetite for thrills and spills , Tsang said when he took on the job.Last week Tsang dismissed accusations that the government was acting like a miser sitting on a cash mountain while holding back welfare spending.But he was also quick to dismiss accusations that China , due to take back the territory from Britain on July 1 , had put the brakes on social spending.In formulating our expenditure programme we had not been overly influenced , we have not been affected , by whatever they call political pressure , he told a meeting of central bankers.The budget to be unveiled on Wednesday has for the first time been worked out in hand with Chinese experts .
It was part of the Sino-British negotiations on details of the sovereignty change , and came against the political backdrop of sour relations between London and Beijing.Since he delivered his maiden budget a year ago , Tsang has landed himself in political controversy.He has spoken out against China 's plans to roll back key clauses in some of Hong Kong 's civil liberties laws -- putting himself at odds with Hong Kong 's future leader.If you ca n't convince the people of Hong Kong , people may take to the streets , some may keep their frustration in their hearts , some in the civil service may quit .
Some may emigrate.Investors are similar .
They talk about substance ( of the laws ) .
If they are happy with it , they will invest more .
If they are n't , they will leave , Tsang said in a newspaper interview.A recent newspaper report said leader-to-be Tung Chee-hwa , who has retained Tsang for the post-colonial government , now plans to sack him because he had upset China.Tsang has declined to comment on the report.In the 1997/98 budget , Tsang has made one departure from past practice by announcing some of the key data in advance.But he has not commented on experts ' predictions of a fiscal surplus of as much as HK $ 25 billion , far higher than the government 's previous forecast of HK $ 1.6 billion.Hong Kong-born Tsang sits atop one of the world 's richest low-tax economies .
In gross domestic product terms , it is equal to one-fifth of China 's economy , though Hong Kong has only 6.4 million people to China 's 1.2 billion.At US $ 66 billion , Hong Kong has the second highest foreign exchange reserves per head on the planet , and it is the globe 's eighth-largest trading economy .
Planned curbs on Hong Kong civil liberties , justified by the future government on grounds of national security , would cut chances of the territory being used to subvert communist China , analysts said on Thursday.But the proposals , launched on Wednesday and offered to the public for three weeks of feedback , drew a torrent of criticism for being retrograde and open to abuse.Citing the risk to national security posed by foreign forces , the future leader Tung Chee-hwa proposed to tighten the screws through two key laws -- the Public Order Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance -- after China takes over the British colony on July 1.The changes would bar overseas funding of local political groups and grant police sweeping powers to ban demonstrations.Currently , people notify police about planned protests .
In future they would need permission , and police could refuse it.Sunny Loh , a political analyst at Hong Kong University , told Reuters the biggest impact would be the ban on foreign funding for Hong Kong political organisations , many of which , such as the popular Democratic Party , raise money abroad.It 's a retrograde step ... Local groups will have to deal with their relations with foreign countries very carefully , he said .
There will be more sensitivity to demonstrations , protests and petitions because they will be seen to affect national security.This would cut the risk of foreign groups using Hong Kong as a base to subvert China , Loh said .
Behind China 's concern is a long history of groups doing just that.Law professor Nihal Jayawickrama said China wanted to keep a close eye on pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong , and the changes would lead to inspections of their accounts for foreign links.How do you make sure they are not being influenced in their thinking by foreign forces ?
... They 'll have to scrutinise the parties ' accounts for foreign funding , he said.In the late 19th century Hong Kong became a base of the nationalist revolutionaries who plotted and overthrew the last imperial dynasty in 1911 , creating China 's first republic.Even the Communists , before they came to power in 1949 , sometimes used Hong Kong as an offshore venue for meetings beyond the reach of Chiang Kai-shek 's Nationalist regime on the mainland.China also has vivid memories of the 1989 democracy movement which its tanks bloodily crushed in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square.The movement received material support from Hong Kong political and business groups , as well as information support through a fax war from groups based abroad .
Some of the activists who fled that crackdown live in exile in Hong Kong.China also fears that Taiwan , its arch-foe and the base of the remnant Nationalist regime which fled the mainland in 1949 , will finance and organise anti-Beijing movements in Hong Kong.After the three week pulse-taking on the plans , a China-backed interim legislature , which will replace the elected Legislative Council , will draft the relevant legislation.The changes will take effect on July 1 when China resumes sovereignty after 156 years of colonial rule and makes Hong Kong into a quasi autonomous Special Administrative Region.Tung 's plans were lashed by the democracy movement , pressure groups , departing colonial Governor Chris Patten , and a raft of editorials in the Hong Kong press.It is not as if we are on the verge of civil chaos -- in theory , at least , trouble could be made more likely by restrictive measures , said the South China Morning Post.The net has been spread so wide that human rights groups , unions , and environment protection groups may also be suppressed if they have political views , said legislator Albert Ho.Analysts said the plan raised queries as to whether foreign groups such as Amnesty International , which has its main Asian office in Hong Kong , could continue operating there.Trade unions and church groups , which receive foreign financial support , could also easily be viewed as political.How are we supposed to survive if we are banned from taking subsidies from international labour groups ?
said Leung Yiu-chung , who runs a neighbourhood labour group .
Hong Kong 's ride to Chinese rule hit a new bump on Wednesday when future leader Tung Chee-hwa put on hold a trip to the United States during which he had planned to calm fears over the British colony 's handover.Tung 's move came as the man who will effectively face him as opposition leader , Martin Lee , became the focus of media attention in the United States on a tour in which he has issued gloomy warnings of a Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong.Tung , who will be Hong Kong 's chief executive , said he was too busy at home , where there are 76 days left before Britain leaves and China 's red flag is hoisted at midnight on June 30.The chief executive believes his focus must be in Hong Kong , Tung said in a statement.Selected by a China-controlled committee in December to run Hong Kong after Beijing resumes sovereignty , Tung had planned a pre-handover visit to the United States to soothe anxiety there about planned curbs on Hong Kong 's political liberties.The cancellation comes despite calls by U.S. executives in the territory , worried that excessive gloom about Hong Kong could harm business ties , for Tung to go to Washington.A spokesman for his office said Tung set great store on Hong Kong 's ties with Washington and would try to make the visit by the end of this year.He denied the postponement was linked to the visit by Lee , leader of the popular Hong Kong Democratic Party , who is meeting President Bill Clinton at the end of the week.He 's just too busy , the spokesman said.Lee has dominated headlines about Hong Kong lately as he toured Europe and North America , warning of China 's plans to curb protests and foreign funding of political groups , and to replace the elected legislature with a handpicked body.In New York , Lee said at the United Nations that the West was morally obliged to make sure China keeps its 1984 treaty promises that Hong Kong will remain a free capitalist society.It becomes the moral obligation of every government that supported the ( treaty ) at least to ensure that China will adhere to her promises made in 1984 and keep Hong Kong free , he said.Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after meeting Lee that she plans to attend the Hong Kong handover ceremony this year , and warned that Washington was watching.I will emphasise America 's continued involvement in protecting our interests and supporting Hong Kong 's people as they enter the Chinese nation , she said.Meanwhile , the pace of politics in Hong Kong was quickening.On Tuesday , the two countries clinched an agreement to let China 's People 's Liberation Army send 40 troops into Hong Kong next Monday to start getting facilities ready for the future Chinese garrison.On Wednesday , the two sides agreed to sell 98 hectares of government land to boost the supply of development land , which should help to ease a chronically tight housing supply.Police forces in Hong Kong and China also agreed to step up joint efforts to combat a tidal wave of illegal immigration into the territory involving mainly children and pregnant women.But on Monday , China angered Britain by unilaterally setting rules on who will have permanent residency rights in Hong Kong after July 1 .
Britain said the right of abode decision should have been taken jointly through diplomatic negotiations.Beijing wanted to force Britain to recognise a China-appointed legislature by agreeing to let the body process the new residency law , senior officials told Reuters .
Governor Chris Patten on Monday urged Beijing , which just released a Hong Kong reporter after three years in jail , to let reporters in the territory write without fear after it reverts to China in July.China released prominent Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang , 40 , last Saturday after he served three years of a 12-year prison term on spy charges.We have our own system , and journalists in our system are not put in prison for embarrassing the government by revealing things the government might not wish to have revealed , Patten told a conference of the Commonwealth Journalists Association.If it were other than that in Hong Kong , there would not be many journalists free on the streets , Patten said.The important thing is that our system , under which journalists can write without fear or favour , should continue.Analysts have been wondering if Xi 's sudden release was an attempt by China to calm a heated debate over its plan to roll back civil liberties in Hong Kong when the territory reverts to its control at midnight this June 30.A China-controlled panel last week listed a string of laws for repealing , including parts of the Bill of Rights and two Hong Kong laws that allow political demonstrations and the free association of groups such as political parties.The plan has earned China rebukes from Britain , the United States and pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong.China also plans to scrap Hong Kong 's elected legislature.On Monday , Hong Kong democracy activists staged a small but noisy protest outside China 's de facto embassy to demand the release of at least 13 dissidents recently reported to have been jailed or arrested in southwestern Guizhou province.The dissidents had been accused of counter-revolutionary activities linked to their pro-democracy campaigning.We are afraid that our freedoms and liberties will be infringed in the future , said activist Andrew To , who led the demonstration outside the Xinhua News Agency office.About 20 members of a Hong Kong alliance supporting China 's beleaguered democracy movement organised the protest.With shouts of set free the dissidents , some 20 activists waved a banner with the slogan , oppose Chinese communists jailing dissidents , as police watched.A protest organiser , Lau Shan-Ching , said China 's release of Xi was marred by the latest news about jailed dissidents.We see China release Xi Yang , but then we see China has arrested 13 dissidents .
So we see China does not change its attitude on human rights , Lau said.After the handover , there may be some dissidents in Hong Kong put into jail , he said.Patten , meanwhile , said censorship was an even bigger threat to the press than the danger of being locked away , and he hoped Beijing would notice the reaction to Xi 's release and the value Hong Kong people place on freedom.Self-censorship or censorship at the news editor 's desk is probably more of a realistic threat in tomorrow 's world -- I do n't say necessarily in Hong Kong -- than handcuffs and barred windows , he said.Britain and China also ran into another snag on Monday on details of the handover , failing to agree on the size and timing of the advance party of People 's Liberation Army troops that China wants to send to Hong Kong before July 1.The main issue , I suppose , is that we pointed out to the Chinese side that their proposals for the numbers of advance personnel are too high and timing of their arrival is too early , said Alan Paul , British representative at the talks.So we put forward a proposal of our own which we regard as reasonable , one which we hope they will consider positively and give us a positive reply at today 's meeting , Paul said .
A dispute over the future of civil liberties in Hong Kong has prompted Britain and the United States to issue stern warnings to China to respect a treaty pledge to preserve basic freedoms.The quarrel flared after a Beijing-controlled panel last Sunday proposed scrapping Hong Kong laws on civil liberties and elections , including part of its Bill of Rights , when China takes over Britain 's last important colony on July 1.As London and Washington aired their warnings , China said it was an internal affair and Hong Kong 's future leader tried to dampen this latest controversy over Chinese post-handover plans.China is moving to replace the elected Legislative Council with a provisional legislature and to block a lenient British law that would exclude China-style crackdowns on dissent.China 's opponents say these steps fly in the face of vows that allow Hong Kong to keep its freedoms after it becomes a Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) of China.The United States said it was deeply concerned about attempts to water down civil liberties in Hong Kong , and called for reconsideration.We are deeply concerned over any attempt to weaken civil liberties and basic freedoms in Hong Kong , State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.Hong Kong 's post-colonial leader , Tung Chee-hwa , who takes over from Governor Chris Patten on July 1 , called for calm.I think we are being too dramatic , Tung told Hong Kong radio .
It is a very complex issue , he said , adding that he would make a fuller statement on the affair on Thursday.Patten , however , continued the war of words .
He said the ill-considered recommendations would be deleterious for our economic success and social stability.For those two qualities are intimately related to our civil liberties , each nourishing the other , he told a gathering of ethnic minorities.Britain 's minister for Hong Kong , Jeremy Hanley , summoned the Chinese ambassador in London to protest .
A Foreign Office spokesman said the proposals were without justification.He said the Bill of Rights was consistent with both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration , which is the treaty governing Hong Kong 's handover , and with the Basic Law , the post-handover constitution promulgated by China.The issue was being hotly debated in Hong Kong , with some analysts predicting a backlash should China roll back basic freedoms in the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people.The Preparatory Committee 's decision , if carried through , will certainly add to the number of political trials that greet the birth of the SAR , said political analyst C.K .
Lau.Should the outcome of those trials be politically unpopular , more and not fewer demonstrations and rallies are likely .
This will be bad for Hong Kong 's international image at a critical time.A leading law expert , Nihal Jayawickrama of Hong Kong University , said the proposals would restore old laws , which had once been applied by colonial authorities against China 's supporters , to crack down on China 's opponents.I think the intention is to use this against elements that have emerged in Hong Kong in the recent past ... It will be used to control public expression , Jayawickrama told Reuters.He said that by restoring the old Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance that imposed restrictions on the freedom of association , China would be turning back the clock in Hong Kong by two or three decades .
Hong Kong 's chief judge came under intense pressure to quit the judiciary on Wednesday after stoking the political fire with a bid to become the territory 's leader after Britain hands the colony back to China in 1997.Politicians and legal experts said Tuesday 's declaration by 67-year-old Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang that he would be a candidate created a conflict of interest and raised a question mark over his role in the British-style judiciary.It is important to give people the confidence that Hong Kong 's judiciary is independent , said lawyer Martin Lee , leader of the colony ' biggest political party , the Democratic Party.Yang dodged suggestions he should quit and told a Hong Kong television station he wanted to tap public opinion first.Whether I should resign is not a question for me , but rather for the executive , for society and the government , for the Chinese side , and for the public , what are their views on this ?
he said.But the resignation calls came even from some members of the pro-Beijing camp.Pro-China politician Tsang Yok-sing said Yang should resign as top judge but welcomed his bid , saying it was good to have more candidates , and especially one politically neutral and without any business connections.He should consider stepping down from his position as Chief Justice .
That should happen as early as possible , Tsang said , speaking to Hong Kong radio from Beijing.It will be seen by the public , by people in the legal profession , that there may be a conflict of interests.Nihal Jayawickrama , a law professor at Hong Kong University , said China-born , British-trained Yang had a right to bid for the leadership , but having entered politics he should now resign.It 's not possible for him to hold the office of Chief Justice any longer .
It 's quite incompatible , Jayawickrama said.There are just 300 days before this bustling capitalist territory of 6.2 million people reverts to communist-ruled China , ending a century and a half of British rule.Now that Yang 's hat is in the ring , with pro-Beijing publisher Xu Simin pledging to nominate him , the leadership stakes have been injected with a new element of competition.Other names touted as possible candidates include Patten 's Chief Secretary Anson Chan , shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa and a former Hong Kong cabinet member , lawyer T.S .
Lo.Chan is widely believed to be unacceptable to China , Tung has not made clear his intentions , and Lo has no proposer yet.A 400-member Selection Committee which will pick the leader and the new legislature is gradually taking shape.Yang , widely seen as a neutral , independent figure because of his judicial career and as a possible compromise candidate , has said he will resign as chief justice if formally nominated.But the earliest Xu can formally propose Yang 's nomination is when the Selection Committee is constituted in November .
Critics say he can not be chief judge and a politician at the same time and should step down ahead of any formal nomination.The latest twist comes amid signals from Beijing that China is setting aside its bitter quarrels with Britain and possibly with Hong Kong 's democrats for the sake of a smooth handover.China 's Hong Kong policy boss Lu Ping said in Beijing on Tuesday he accepted that Britain and China might not settle all disagreements by the time of the midnight June 30 handover.We shall try our best to resolve minor differences before July 1 , 1997 .
If we fail , we can put them aside , Lu said.He added that he was willing to shake hands on that day with his arch-rival , Hong Kong 's colonial governor Chris Patten.The handover negotiations have been a thorny process .
Patten and pro-democracy groups have been quick to dub most of China 's moves as anti-democratic in recent years , especially its plan to scrap the elected legislature for an appointed provisional body .
Quaker Oats Co. may take a charge of up $ 1 billion to write-down its money-losing Snapple beverage business , analysts said Monday , but the charge may not show up in its fourth quarter earnings report expected to be announced next week.I think it could be close to $ 1 billion , BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said of the charge to write-down the value of Snapple.In November , Quaker said it would review Snapple , which it acquired about two years ago for $ 1.8 billion , to see if it must take a charge to reduce the value of the business on its balance sheet.The probability is reasonably high that they do ( take a write-down ) , said Michael Mauboussin , analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston .
He also believed that it could be about $ 1 billion.Quaker spokesman Ronald Bottrell said a review of Snapple 's operations was continuing , but declined to comment on whether the company planned to take a charge.Steven Galbraith , an analyst at Sanford Bernstein said he believed that Quaker would be compelled to take a charge for Snapple .
It 's clearly an impaired asset , he said.Quaker could avoid taking a write-down to reduce the carrying value of Snapple if it sold that business along with its Gatorade sports beverage , Galbraith said.Speculation continues that Quaker is looking to sell both Snapple , which it has said will have an operating loss in 1996 , and Gatorade , its largest single brand , analysts said.If the two beverage businesses were sold together , Galbraith said Quaker might be able to offset a gain from Gatorade with the loss from Snapple .
He valued the two businesses together at about $ 3 billion.If I did n't see a charge this quarter ( for Snapple ) , I would raise eyebrows , meaning something is up , Galbraith said.Quaker Oats has repeatedly declined to comment on speculation that it was likely to sell Snapple and Gatorade.I will tell you again it is our policy not to comment on rumours and speculation , Bottrell said.Many names have surfaced in the past as possible suitors for Quaker 's beverage businesses , including Procter & amp ; Gamble Co. , Coca-Cola Co. , PepsiCo Inc. and Cadbury Schweppes Plc.None of the companies in the past has commented on the speculation.Quaker 's stock was off $ 1 cents at $ 37.375 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading .
Earthgrains Co , the baked goods concern spun off less than a year ago by beer brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc , aims to expand geographically through acquisitions in a consolidating industry.How fast we do it will depend on how those properties become available and what we have to pay for them .
But we are looking for geographic expansion through acquisitions , Chairman Barry Beracha said in an interview .Earthgrains made a presentation at an analyst conference here .
Earthgrains serves about 35 percent of the U.S. population with a presence in the Southeast , Midwest , Southwest and Far West.The company , which was shed in March 1996 , made a few acquisitions in late 1996 in Mississippi , West Virginia and Texas .
Those deals helped expand Earthgrains ' reach and took some excess capacity out of the baking industry.The key for us is to use the industry consolidation as a way to improve our profitability and improve shareholder value and not just get bigger , Beracha said .
While geographic expansion through acquisitions will be the main driver of Earthgrains ' future growth , Beracha said the company is also looking to increase revenues , including with new products.The company , which is the third-largest producer of fresh baked goods with brands like IronKids , recently launched fresh bagels under its Earth Grains brand .
It is also testing other products , all of which fall in the higher end of the bread and baked goods category .
Earthgrains sees a greater willingness for consumers to pay more for products that promise better flavor or enhanced nutrition .
Beracha pointed to recent sales data that showed per capita bread consumption in pounds is flat , but sales revenues are up.Earthgrains , which also produces refrigerated dough in both the United States and Europe and has a European bakery operation , posted third quarter sales of $ 523 million .
Adjusting for facilities and businesses that were closed or sold , sales rose 3.9 percent.On the profit side , Earthgrains posted a dramatic turnaround , with third quarter earnings of $ 0.91 a share , compared with a year-ago loss of $ 0.91 a share before extraordinary items.In our first year ... we 've exceeded most people 's expectations , Beracha said .
The really good news behind that is there 's still a long way to go .
( ( Reuters Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787 ) ) McDonald 's Corp. has turned up the heat in the fast-food business.If franchisees go along with the plan , the world 's largest restaurant chain will launch its biggest nationwide promotion ever , featuring 55-cent sandwiches , down from about $ 1.95 for a Big Mac , according to franchisee sources.The plan is a bold step to lure customers into McDonald 's restaurants in the face of intense competition in the nation 's $ 100 billion fast-food business , industry analysts said.McDonald 's , which has more than 20,000 units worldwide and more than 12,000 in the United States , declined to give specifics on its plan .
Spokesman Jack Daly said the Oak Brook , Ill.-based company hopes to launch a national value-price promotion.Pointing to a current promotion on Chicken McNugget sandwiches , which analysts said has helped McDonald 's build sales this month , Daly said , It 's in that same spirit.Charles Gonzales , a McDonald 's franchisee with two units in the San Francisco area , said the nationwide promotion would feature a different sandwich for 55 cents each month when a customer buys french fries and a drink at the regular price.The promotion , he added , is expected to start with the Big Mac hamburger , which is usually priced between $ 1.90 and $ 1.99 , and will include breakfast sandwiches as well , he said.But the promotion , to be presented to franchisees on Thursday , could spark a price war , analysts said .
That prospect worried investors who drove fast-food stocks sharply lower.Everyone will have something for 55 cents .
Now it 's a zero-sum game again , said Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok.But Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said Wendy 's International Inc. and Burger King , a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc , may not match McDonald 's price promotions right away.There are a lot of things ( companies can do ) to enhance value without directly cutting prices , Adelman said , including increasing the frequency of regular promotions.Burger King said it had no plans to change its prices .
Wendy 's officials also said they wo n't cut prices in response to McDonald 's plan.McDonald 's stock tumbled $ 2.625 to $ 44.625 and Wendy 's slid $ 1.50 to $ 20.75 on the New York Stock Exchange , where the shares were among the most active issues .
American shares of Britain 's Grand Metropolitan Plc , which owns Burger King , fell $ 1 to $ 30.625 , also on the NYSE.Dean Witter 's Adelman said it remained to be seen if the McDonald 's plan will bring in more customers .
We have much more jaded consumers today , he said , noting price cuts were not new news.Gonzales noted some franchisees oppose price promotions since they often do not boost customer traffic enough to offset lower sandwich prices .
Moreover , regular customers may be tempted to order whatever sandwich is being offered that month instead of higher-priced menu items , he said.Daly , however , said increased sales volume is expected to offset lower menu prices .
Margins ( are ) a function of volume , he added.Dick Adams , chairman of the Consortium , an independent association of McDonald 's franchisees , said he expected the promotion plan to be approved.They ( franchisees ) are going to vote for it , Adams said .
They are being told that it 's the only plan that is available.He said McDonald 's was expected to present the plan in a satellite broadcast to operators across the country on Thursday.McDonald 's has been looking to boost domestic sales , which have been pressured because of competition .
In a December 1996 memo to owners and operators , Jack Greenberg , chairman of McDonald 's U.S.A. said , We must re-energise and focus our U.S. marketing efforts and develop a national value proposition .
Vita Food Products Inc , which sells kosher seafood and other specialty products , is scouting for acqusitions that could help it boost annual sales four-fold within the next five years.With the right mix of acquisitions , I think we could do $ 75 million to $ 100 million ( in sales ) annually .
We 've ( also ) got some things that could really take off internally , Stephen Rubin , president , said in an interview .
I 'd like to see it ( the sales target reached ) before five years.Vita 's sales amounted to $ 21.4 million in 1995 .
The company , with products such as salmon and herring sold under the Vita brand , expects to complete at least one acquisition by the end of the year , Rubin said.Acquisition targets include companies that sell kosher food or products that could later be certified as kosher .
One of the targets is related to seafood , he added.Rubin added that Vita could also acquire a regional , non-kosher food company and take it national under the existing brand name through Vita 's distribution network.Over 95 percent of Vita 's sales , however , are kosher products .
Jay Dembsky , Vita 's chief financial officer , estimated that the kosher food market overall is growing by 10 to 11 percent annually , whereas the overall food industry grows only in line with the population.Kosher food , he added , appeals to consumers beyond those adhering to Jewish dietary laws .
Kosher food carries a perception of higher quality , Dembsky said.Vita also hopes to reap higher sales in 1997 from two new products that were rolled out in the fourth quarter of 1996 -- a line of hummus , a Middle Eastern dish made from chick peas , and frozen salmon burgers.We expect to see meaningful impact in 1997 from these products , Dembsky said.Vita , which went public earlier this year at $ 6.00 a share , said it would make secondary offerings in the future if it needed to raise capital for acquisition programs , Rubin said.Vita shres were up 1/8 at 5-1/8 .
( ( Reuters Chicago Newsdesk ( 312 ) 408-8787 ) ) Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc , which set records for sales , profit and beer volume in 1996 , said Wednesday it continues to aim for a double-digit percentage increase in its earnings per share in 1997.Our projection for this year is double-digits ... EPS growth , W. Randolph Randy Baker , chief financial officer , said in a telephone interview.Anheuser , which brews Budweiser and Michelob beer , earned $ 2.21 a share from continuing operations in 1996 , up 11 percent from $ 1.99 in 1995 , both before extraordinary items .
For the fourth quarter , it earned $ 0.30 a share , in line with analysts ' expectations , compared with earnings from continuing operations , and excluding charges , of $ 0.27 a share in the 1995 fourth quarter .
The year-ago fourth quarter results exclude $ 160.0 million in costs for closing a Tampa , Fla. , brewery and $ 74.5 million in costs for wholesale inventory reductions.As we end 1996 and begin 1997 , we do so in a position of great competitive strength and we have set the stage for significant long-term earnings growth for 1997 , Baker said .
Gross sales for 1996 , before excise taxes , were a record $ 12.6 billion in 1996 , up four percent from 1995.Anheuser said it sold a record 91.1 million barrels of beer in 1996 , up 4.1 percent from 1995 .
Adjusting for an inventory reduction in 1995 , beer volume grew 2.8 percent.The company also boosted its leading domestic market share in 1996 by 1.1 points to 45.2 percent.The volume growth remains very , very good , Oppenheimer and Co analyst Roy Burry said .
That 's the problem.With Anheuser being the only U.S. major brewer to gain market share , competition has intensified , Burry said .
In spite of the increased competition , Baker said Anheuser implemented about a three percent price increase , equal to $ 0.10 to $ 0.15 per six-pack of beer , in much of the United States this month .
This followed a similar price increase in seven states in September and October of 1996.He said it is too soon to tell if the price increases are holding .
But preliminary reports indicate Anheuser 's major competitors are following the price move on their premium brands in a majority of markets , he added.Internationally , Anheuser reaped a double-digit increase in sales volume in 1996 , Baker said , continuing a trend for this business.International brewing profit dropped slightly in 1996 compared to 1995 , due in part to increased marketing expenses.Anheuser has been building its overseas beer business with ventures and investments in foreign brewers .
In December , it increased its ownership in Grupo Modelo SA de CV to 37 percent for an investment of about $ 550 million.The company said its Busch Entertainment theme park subsidiary made a significant contribution to earnings in 1996 , with its fifth consecutive year of record attendance and profitability .

Kellogg Co. Friday reported a profit for the fourth quarter , reversing a year-ago loss , but said the U.S. and British breakfast cereal markets remained difficult.The largest producer in the $ 9 billion U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market , Kellogg 's domestic cereal sales fell in the quarter , spokesman Richard Lovell said .
He would not elaborate , though analysts said the drop was about 5 percent.Kellogg , whose brands include Kellogg 's Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies , had a profit of $ 87.3 million or 42 cents a share , in the quarter , compared with a loss of $ 71.6 million , or 33 cents a share in the 1996 quarter.The results included restructuring and other charges of $ 110.7 million in the latest quarter and $ 369 million in the 1995 quarter.Sales fell 6 percent to $ 1.56 billion from $ 1.66 billion.The restructuring is meant to save at least $ 160 million in savings this year and in future years , it said.Excluding charges and extraordinary costs , Kellogg 's earnings amounted to 78 cents a share in the quarter , compared with 77 cents a share in the 1995 period , which was in line with Kellogg 's own projections.Analysts said lower marketing expenditures helped the company hit its earnings target for the quarter .
Because of that , the quality of earnings in the quarter was not good , said Robert Cummins , managing director of Schroder Wertheim.Lovell said marketing expenditures declined but would not say how much .
Total selling and administrative expense fell nearly 15 percent to $ 540.7 million from $ 633.5 million.It seems like they 're cutting off their nose to spite their face by cutting back marketing when sales volumes are declining , said Donaldson , Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach.Lovell said spending on marketing was likely to rise this year from 1996 levels .
Selling and administrative costs for 1996 dropped about 4 percent to $ 2.5 billion.Analysts said some of the increased promotional spending will go for new cereals that Kellogg expects to launch in 1997 .
The company introduced Kellogg 's Honey Crunch Corn Flakes cereal in the United States in September , which garnered a strong a 1.3 percent market share , Kellogg 's said.While the U.S. and U.K. remain challenging , we are encouraged by the contribution of new cereal products in both markets , Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement.Internationally , cereal sales volume rose , Lovell said , with analysts estimating the increase at 4 percent to 6 percent.Kellogg , which also makes Nutri-Grain snack bars , said convenience foods had a double-digit sales gain in the quarter .
We look forward to the continued growth of this business , both in the U.S. , where we have recently acquired Lender 's Bagels , and through expansion to new international markets , Longbo added.Overall , global volume grew 2 percent in the quarter and 1 percent for all of 1996.Looking ahead , Kellogg repeated that it expected a low double-digit percentage increase in earnings for 1997 , compared with 1996 .
The first quarter , however , is expected to be down from the $ 212.2 million , or 99 cents a share , earned in the first quarter of 1996.Kellogg 's stock rose $ 1 to $ 69 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
ConAgra Inc said Tuesday its spread of operations across the food chain -- from seed distribution to meat processing and frozen foods -- is a positive for the company that outweighs its exposure to the commodity markets.I see it as a great positive , ConAgra Chairman Philip Fletcher said in an interview Tuesday .
ConAgra was among the food companies presenting at an analyst conference here .
In the past , ConAgra has faced some criticism for having commodity-sensitive operations that could be a drag on its value-added foods such as its $ 1.5 billion Healthy Choice line.As you look around the globe with the doubling of the population by 2030 , they are n't going to be buying frozen foods in a lot of those markets , Fletcher said .
But they sure ... are going to be buying a lot of chicken , hogs and ... grain ( products ) ... I see the front end of the chain providing us , frankly , a lot more opportunity for the next five or so years than the back end of the chain .
Across its scope of food operations , ConAgra continues to seek out acquisitions that typically contribute about one-third of its earnings growth over time , Bruce Rohde , vice chairman , added.Every year we do a dozen or so ( acquisitions ) , he said.Fletcher said acquisitions are scouted out by top executives at its various operating divisions , who must then sell the idea to the corporation.We think the acquisition process is one of our strengths , Fletcher added .
Beyond acquisitions , ConAgra continues to grow by new product introductions , particularly in its grocery products division .
In the first half of fiscal 1997 , ConAgra 's grocery products posted a 26 percent rise in operating profits.The key driver these days is to make our food much more easy to prepare , David Gustin , president of ConAgra Grocery Products , said.While studies indicate a desire to eat more at home , consumers continue to shy away from traditional cooking.This requires a drastic change in our attitude toward what the definition of convenience is , Gustin said.For many consumers , he added , this means meal preparation times of five to 10 minutes.ConAgra 's new products aimed at greater convenience include its Butterball-brand baked chicken and Healthy Choice Hearty Handfuls microwaveable stuffed sandwiches.Other new products being launched by ConAgra include a line of popcorn snack cakes under its Orville Redenbacher 's brand .
( ( Chicago newsdesk , 312-408-8787 ) ) Quaker Oats Co. Thursday reported a profit for the fourth quarter , reversing a year-ago loss , but said its Snapple beverage business was unprofitable and continued to be a disappointment.Quaker said Snapple 's U.S. and Canadian sales dropped 8 percent in 1996 , with volume down 11 percent .
Sales of its six-flavor Diet Snapple line , however , rose 23 percent in 1996.Chicago-based Quaker said it earned $ 18.1 million , or 12 cents a share , in the fourth quarter , compared with a loss of $ 47.8 million , or 36 cents a share , in the 1995 period .
Excluding a $ 40.8 million pretax restructuring charge in the 1995 fourth quarter , Quaker posted a year-ago operating loss 18 cents a share.Fourth quarter revenues were $ 1.06 billion , down 10 percent from $ 1.18 billion a year earlier , which included $ 90.3 million from divested businesses.For the full year , Quaker said it earned $ 244 million , or $ 1.80 a share , which included a $ 113.4 million gain on divested business .
In 1995 , it earned $ 720 million , or $ 5.39 per share , with a $ 1.05 billion gain.Sales last year were $ 5.20 billion , 13 percent below the previous year 's $ 5.95 billion , which included $ 796.9 million from divested businesses.This was a rebound year in which our largest , value-driving businesses -- U.S. and Canadian foods and worldwide Gatorade -- increased their operating profits , Chairman William Smithburg said in a statement.A $ 100 million cutback in advertising and marketing costs in 1996 also helped results , analysts added.In a conference call , Smithburg said Quaker was committed to at least 10 percent real earnings growth in 1997 .
We 're going to try like crazy to do even better than that , he said.Quaker management again pledged to turn around Snapple , which it bought over two years ago for $ 1.8 billion.We need to stabilise ( Snapple 's ) volume in 1997 , Smithburg said .
Our goal is to operate Snapple at cash positive in 1997.Cash positive means Snapple is expected to be profitable , excluding goodwill charges of about $ 50 million a year.Quaker surprised some analysts by not taking a charge in the fourth quarter to reduce Snapple 's value .
Analysts had expected Quaker to take a large writedown for Snapple , potentially as high as $ 1 billion.Smithburg declined to comment on speculation and rumours that Quaker was looking to sell Snapple , a fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business , and its Gatorade sports drink.He said Quaker 's management continues to review steps to create value for shareholders , but declined to be specific.Gatorade , Quaker 's largest brand , had a strong year in 1996 , Smithburg said , with sales volume rising 6 percent in the fourth quarter and 4 percent year-to-date.Gatorade is launching this year a Frost line of Gatorade beverages that will feature a cooling taste , Smithburg said .
The trade acceptance has been nothing short of terrific.Smithburg said the company 's hot cereals business had a strong year , with sales volume up 9 percent.Ready-to-eat cereals , such as Cap'n Crunch and Life , gained 3 percent in volume for 1996 .
The value-priced line of bagged cereals grew more than 40 percent in the year.Quaker stock was down 62.5 cents at $ 35.875 in afternoon trading .
Interstate Bakeries Corp chairman Charles Sullivan said Thursday he backs analysts ' earnings estimates of $ 0.35- $ 0.40 a share for the company 's third quarter .
( Corrects timeframe from fiscal 1997 ) We told them ( analysts ) we 're not uncomfortable with that , Sullivan said in an interview here after a presentation at an analysts ' conference .
In the year ago third quarter , the company earned $ 0.11 a share.Sullivan said the anticipated growth in third quarter earnings reflects reduced costs , higher revenues and increased sales of branded products.Interstate , the largest baker and distributor of fresh bakery products in the United States has brands including Wonder , Hostess and Dolly Madison .
Moving forward , Interstate said it plans to extend those brand lines with new products , seeking to appeal to children with offerings like bubble gum flavored mini muffins and to adults with improved low fat Hostess Twinkies.Interstate also began rolling out last month a fat-free Wonder bread , which it expects will appeal to an older consumer.The company is also looking to extend its reach in the United States , looking for acquisitions in a consolidating industry.Sullivan said Interstate plans to acquire an existing bakery operation , west of the Mississippi River .
He would provide no other details.That deal would help offset lost revenue from government-ordered divestitures after Interstate 's 1995 purchase of Continental Baking Co , he said .
( ( Chicago newsdesk , 312-408-8787 ) ) Moves by two of Japan 's most troubled banks to tackle their massive problem loans are not enough to get in shape for Japan 's sweeping Big Bang financial deregulation , analysts said on Tuesday.Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd , Japan 's 10th biggest commercial bank , and regional bank Hokkaido Bank Ltd , both based in Sapporo , announced they would merge next April and withdraw from overseas operations by next March.Long-troubled Nippon Credit Bank Ltd ( NCB ) , the smallest of the nation 's three long-term credit banks , separately announced that it will restructure , halting overseas operations , selling off its Tokyo headquarters and posting losses to dispose of problem loans.As for the merger agreement by the two Hokkaido banks to restructure their operations , it is not impressive at all , said Yushiro Ikuyo , first vice-president of Smith Barney International Inc.The restructuring programme announced by Nippon Credit Bank is quite drastic , but when taking into account the size of its massive problem loans , the programme falls short of solving its bad loan woes , he said.Hokkaido Takushoku and NCB are among the nation 's weakest banks.The Moody 's Investors Service ratings agency assigns its lowest E ratings to both institutions , along with Chuo Trust & amp ; Banking and Yasuda Trust & amp ; Banking.There are no U.S. banks which received an E rating .
Banks with E ratings are those which have been supported ( in Japan 's regulated system ) despite their inefficiency , a Moody 's officer recently said.After the announcement of the merger and the restructuring plans , a spokeswoman at Moody 's said that analysts in Tokyo and New York were expected to hold a ratings meeting later in the day but did not say if any ratings would be changed.The Hokkaido merger is seen as putting two problem institutions together , some analysts said.It 's a step in the right direction but they are taking two banks with huge bad debt problems -- merge them together and you 've got a colossal bad debt problem to deal with , said Brian Waterhouse , an analyst at HSBC James Capel.Unless we see some public funds being used to assist with this it is unlikely that they will deal with all their problem loans before the merger , he said.Problem loans at Hokkaido Takushoku totalled 936 billion yen ( $ 7.54 billion ) at the end of last September , accounting for 13.34 percent of loans outstanding.Hokkaido Bank said its problem loans totalled 167 billion yen ( $ 1.34 billion ) at the end of September , but financial analysts say the actual number is larger.NCB will meanwhile dispose of 460 billion yen ( $ 3.70 billion ) in problem loans in 1996/97 , enabling the bank to cover 48 percent of its problem loan portfolio.However , Yukiko Ohara , an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd , said that NCB 's restructuring is not enough to solve the problem loan mess.In order to tackle Japan 's problem loan woes , you will have to set up a clear system to determine how public money will be used , she said .
( $ 1=124 ) Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday raided the country 's biggest brokerage , Nomura Securities Co Ltd , in a dramatic sign of a widening probe into its part in payments to a client linked to racketeers.The late afternoon raid on Nomura headquarters in central Tokyo was by both prosecutors and officials of the nation 's securities watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission ( SESC ) .The highly public raids appeared to signal that the Nomura incident could become a showcase crackdown as Japan seeks to clean up business practices and deregulate its economy.Coinciding with the headquarters raid , 90 officials raided 10 other locations and for the first time formally spelled out in detail what they were investigating.Deputy chief prosecutor Kunihiro Matsuo told reporters the raids were to investigate a Nomura director 's illegal payment of 38 million yen ( $ 309,000 ) to a company run by a relative of a racketeer to avoid disruption of a Nomura annual meeting.Matsuo said the other raids included searches of the homes of the racketeer , or sokaiya , as well as the Nomura director involved in the scandal , Shimpei Matsuki , and other Nomura executives.Police have said Sokaiya , often linked to yakuza crime syndicates , extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders ' meetings -- called sokai in Japanese.The scandal surfaced on March 6 .
Matsuki and fellow director Nobutaka Fujikura resigned on March 10 after internal probes found they made discretionary deals banned under Japanese securities law and funnelled profits to a front company for the racketeer.Individuals found to have violated the law would face a fine of up to one million yen ( $ 8,100 ) and a maximum one-year jail sentence .
If the company is found in violation , the fine is up to 100 million yen ( $ 813,000 ) .A government source said that the SESC had decided to search the firm 's headquarters while investigations were still under way because of concerns that evidence could be hidden.The company said on Tuesday it regretted the raids but would cooperate with investigators.Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down on March 14 to atone for the scandal .
Chairman Masashi Suzuki took over his position while retaining the chairmanship.Nomura , as well as share trading , exerts a powerful influence on every business in the yen bond market and is also Japan 's top foreign bond seller.The company has seen key foreign and domestic clients suspend business with it since the scandal broke.Nomura has been a key player in Japanese financial markets for most of this century , including underwriting firms such as Sony Corp , which were part of Japan 's postwar economic miracle.In a scene akin to a Japanese film , 90 officials in business suits , led by a man with a briefcase , marched military-style through the front doors of Nomura 's modernistic headquarters.They locked the doors , shutting out journalists gathered for a raid designed to have maximum publicity.Reports of the raids hit Nomura 's share price , which ended the day down 20 yen ( 16 cents ) at 1,440 yen ( $ 11.70 ) .What the market is more concerned about is any punitive measures which will be taken against the brokerage , said Yasuo Ueki , Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager.The punishment will probably have an effect on the firm 's business and could have an impact on the whole brokerage industry as well , Ueki said.The investigation comes six years after Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients.Top executives at Nomura resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations of deals with gangsters .
( $ 1=123 yen ) Most of Japan 's second-tier brokerages said on Wednesday that they would land in the red in the current business year because of tumbling Tokyo stock prices.Many of the firms had previously expected to turn a profit for the 12 months to March 31 after making losses the year before , but the downward spiral in stock prices seen earlier this year has dashed their hopes of a robust bottom line.The nine brokerages said the drop in the Tokyo stock market had forced them to take write offs on the shares they own in listed companies , particularly banks.The stock slump , triggered by worries about the sputtering economic recovery and banking woes , also ate into commission income as investors shied away from the market.While we have profits from bond trading , we were forced , unexpectedly , to post appraisal losses on shareholdings because stock prices fell sharply from January onwards , an executive at Okasan Securities Co Ltd told a news conference.The nine brokers which issued revised earnings forecasts on Wednesday were Okasan , Sanyo Securities Co Ltd , New Japan Securities Co Ltd , Kankaku Securities Co Ltd , Tokyo Securities Co Ltd , Cosmo Securities Co Ltd , Dai-Ichi Securities Co Ltd , Wako Securities Co Ltd and Yamatane Securities Co Ltd .
The only other brokerage in the second tier , Kokusai Securities Co Ltd , did not revise its existing forecast , which is for a profit.Predicted parent current losses ranged from 1.5 billion yen ( $ 12.1 million ) for Sanyo and Okasan to a hefty 22 billion yen ( $ 178 million ) at Kankaku .
In 1995/96 , the nine firms had suffered losses ranging from 1.0 billion yen ( $ 8.1 million ) at Cosmo to 18.11 billion yen ( $ 147 million ) at Sanyo.The key Nikkei average finished at 18,493.71 on Wednesday compared with 21,406.85 at the end of fiscal 1995/96.The firms said daily turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the fiscal year so far had been averaging about 380 billion yen ( $ 3.08 billion ) , much lower than they had expected.Analysts said that to ensure profits , the second-tier brokerages need the daily turnover to be 500 billion yen ( $ 4.06 billion ) or more .
Medium-sized brokerages rely more heavily on business from small investors than the top-ranking ones.Analysts said that the second-tier brokers need to further streamline their business to cut costs ahead of the likely liberalisation of brokerage commissions next year in Japan 's broad deregulation drive.Revenue has fallen sharply since the early 1990s , when Japan 's asset bubble collapsed , but the brokerages have not managed to scale back costs to the same extent , they said.Some of second-tier brokerages are likely to join holding companies led by big banks in the future in line with Japan 's Big Bang financial reforms , said Yukiko Ohara , an analyst at UBS Securites Ltd. ( $ 1=123 yen ) Heavily indebted Nippon Credit Bank Ltd said on Thursday it will tie up with New York blue chip Bankers Trust to help turn some of its loans into cash.NCB , with a heavy load of real estate loans left over from the asset bubble of the 1980s , has been considered the most endangered large bank in Japan 's faltering banking sector.On April 1 it announced that it was retreating from the international arena .
It also said that it was selling prime real estate and floating new shares to try to rebuild its capital base.Under the alliance , Bankers Trust will help NCB securitise some of its loans , turning them into stocks or bonds that are sold to outside investors.The tie-up with Bankers Trust will also enable NCB to maintain services to its customers after its planned withdrawal from overseas business , the two banks said.NCB said that it would also consider a capital tie-up with Bankers Trust , which is on an expansion drive.We will consider limited capital participation in each other after the ongoing restructuring of NCB 's capital is completed , the statement said.Industry analysts said such an equity deal would be the first time a foreign bank has taken a stake in a Japanese bank.But they said that it was very unlikely that Bankers Trust would take over NCB .
( The tie-up ) will make it easier for NCB to implement its restructuring programme , but its return on equity is too low for the U.S. bank to consider any takeover move , said Yoshinobu Yamada , analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan.The market took the news well , with an increase in buying interest in NCB debentures .
As one of Japan 's three long-term credit banks , NCB raises the bulk of its cash through issuing debentures rather than taking deposits from customers.In a blow to NCB 's image , the debentures were recently downgraded to junk-bond status by Moody 's Investors Service.But Thursday 's announcement won praise from regulators and the markets.The tie-up will contribute greatly to a smooth implementation of NCB 's restructuring plan , the Bank of Japan said in a statement.The deal was also cheered by the stock market , with NCB shares surging as much as 30 percent in afternoon trading .
There was no trading for most of the day due to a surge of buy orders hitting the market.When NCB announced its restructuring , President Hiroshi Kubota said the bank was very interested in getting help from a foreign partner , a rare statement for a Japanese corporate leader and seen as a sign of the difficult situation facing NCB in its attempt to get back on its feet .
Japanese life insurers may ask for support from banks to liquidate failed Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co , industry sources said on Friday.While life insurers have basically agreed to provide a total of 200 billion yen to help liquidate the firm , they are worried whether their contributions will be enough to cover losses resulting from the failure , they said.Nissan Life was ordered by the Finance Ministry to start shutting down its business on April 25 .
It was the first failure of a life insurance firm in Japan in the post-war period.Nissan Life 's liabilities were estimated to have exceeded its assets by 200 billion yen.If the life insurance industry alone can not cover the losses , we may ask for some kind of support from banks which have business ties with Nissan Mutual Life , one industry source said.He said that there were more than 100 banks and credit associations with business ties to Nissan Life.Koichi Yoshida , the president-designate of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co , said this week that banks should help sort out the collapse of Nissan Life.An official at the Life Insurance Association of Japan , which was appointed by the Finance Ministry to work out a scheme to wind up Nissan Life , said it had not yet done so as it was still examining the firm 's financial situation.It will take three weeks or more to complete the inspection , the official said.Association chairman Kenjiro Hata told reporters last month it may also seek capital contributions from major clients of Nissan Life -- Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Hitachi Ltd.Industry sources said that Nissan Life policy holders would probably be asked to accept an increase in premiums or cuts in payments.They said that the most likely liquidation scheme would involve the establishment of a joint company to take over Nissan Life 's assets.However , one estimate had shown that the new company could post losses of some 30 billion yen a year if conditions of existing insurance contracts were not changed , the sources said.Nearly half of Nissan Life 's 2.1 trillion yen in assets are individual pension policies that have guaranteed high returns .
Many were contracted in the late-1980s bubble economy era.When interest rates fell and the stock market languished following the collapse of the bubble economy , a large gap developed between investment yields and guaranteed returns to policy holders .
Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday raided the country 's biggest brokerage , Nomura Securities Co Ltd , in a dramatic sign of a widening probe into its part in payments to a client linked to racketeers.The late afternoon raid on Nomura headquarters in central Tokyo was by both prosecutors and officials of the nation 's securities watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission ( SESC ) .The highly public raids , including tipoffs to the media that they were imminent , appeared to signal the Nomura incident could become a showcase as Japan seeks to clean up business practices and deregulate its economy.Coinciding with the headquarters raid , another 90 officials swooped on 10 other locations and for the first time formally spelled out in detail what they were investigating.Deputy chief prosecutor Kunihiro Matsuo told reporters the raids were to investigate a Nomura director 's illegal payment of 38 million yen ( $ 309,000 ) to a company run by a relative of a racketeer to avoid disruption of a Nomura annual meeting.Matsuo said the other raids included searches of the homes of the racketeer or sokaiya and the Nomura director involved in the scandal , Shimpei Matsuki.The scandal surfaced on March 6 and Matsuki and fellow director Nobutaka Fujikura resigned on March 10 after internal probes found they made discretionary deals banned under Japanese law and funnelled profits to a front company for the racketeer.Sokaiya , often linked to yakuza crime syndicates , extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders ' meetings -- called sokai in Japanese.Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down on March 14 to atone for the scandal .
He became an adviser to the company , and chairman Masashi Suzuki took over his position while retaining the chairmanship.Nomura , one of the world 's most powerful financial institutions , is involved in bond and share trading.It exerts a powerful influence on every business in the yen bond market and is also Japan 's top foreign bond seller.The company has seen key foreign and domestic clients suspend business with it since the scandal broke.Nomura has been a key player in Japanese financial markets for most of this century , including underwriting firms such as Sony Corp , which were part of Japan 's postwar economic miracle.In a scene akin to a Japanese film , 90 officials in business suits , led by a man with a briefcase , marched military-style through the front doors of Nomura 's modernistic headquarters.They firmly locked the doors , shutting out journalists gathered for a raid designed to have maximum publicity value.Reports that the raids were imminent hit Nomura 's share price , which ended the day down 20 yen ( 16 cents ) at 1,440 ( $ 11.70 ) .But brokers said the impact of the news was limited as the market had expected such a development.What the market is more concerned about is any punitive measures which will be taken against the brokerage , said Yasuo Ueki , Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager.The punishment will probably have an effect on the firm 's business and could have an impact on the whole brokerage industry as well , Ueki said.The investigation comes six years after Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients.Top executives at Nomura resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters .
( $ 1=123 yen ) The resignation of the president of Nomura Securities Co Ltd on Friday should be only a first step by the country 's top brokerage house in restoring its scandal-scarred image.Analysts believe the resignation should just be to clear the decks so Nomura can carry out widespread management restructuring , including bringing in a young , untainted leader to help win back public trust.In a hastily called news conference , Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki , 62 , said that he had stepped down and would become simply an adviser to the firm .
Chairman Masashi Suzuki , also 62 , took over the post of president in addition to the chairmanship.Sakamaki 's resignation followed the departure of two Nomura directors who quit the brokerage last week after they were found to have made apparently illegal stock deals and funnelled funds to a corporate client linked by Japanese media to a former sokaiya racketeer.Several analysts said the resignation stopped far short of the action needed to restore public trust.David Threadgold , an analyst at BZW Securities Ltd , said although Sakamaki had resigned the failure to immediately announce his permanent replacement indicated the firm had not been able to find the right person to replace him.Yushiro Ikuyo , first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc , said Nomura may take several years to recover from a scandal which was a repeat of similar incidents in the early 1990s.Ikuyo said the fact there was a repeat scandal indicated there was a problem with Nomura 's corporate mentality.Nomura has the potential to be a Japanese company which could be a winner in international competition and under Japan 's Big Bang reforms as an investment bank , he said.To change the corporate culture , a drastic restructuring in management , such as the resignation of all senior executives , must be considered and a young and clean leader appointed , he said.Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has vowed to carry out Big Bang financial reforms to implement substantial deregulation by 2001.A securities analyst , who declined to be named , was sceptical that a wholesale clean-up could be carried out.All the top executives have great contacts with corporate Japan , the analyst said .
In Japanese business , it 's also going to be hard to find a 'Mr .
Clean .
'A senior Finance Ministry ( MOF ) official told Reuters this week the ministry is waiting the outcome of investigations by the country 's securities watchdog over the suspect deals.But the official said MOF was focusing on whether Nomura violated the Commercial Code , rather than securities laws.Sokaiya extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders ' meeting , or offer to prevent a disruption of the proceedings by unruly shareholders.Japanese commercial law has prohibited paying off racketeers since 1982.Ironically , Sakamaki 's presidency began in 1991 when top executives Setsuya Tabuchi and Yoshihisa Tabuchi ( no relation ) resigned after revelations the brokerage compensated elite clients for losses and affiliates dealt with organised crime.The two Tabuchis , however , rejoined Nomura 's board in 1995 , triggering a controversy among Nomura employees because the two were regarded as a symbol of the firm 's previous tainted corporate culture -- aggressively grabbing profits , even sacrificing small investors ' interests.New president Suzuki said that the two Tabuchis offered to resign from the board again .
He said he would accept their offers which are not related to the scandals.My first priority is to restore confidence .
I would like to transform the company to one with a healthy situation and transfer the company to the next generation , Suzuki said.He said that he would take all possible steps to avoid a recurrence of wrongdoing but fell short of announcing details.Nomura is not a family-run company and Suzuki 's position as both president and chairman is something irregular , an analyst at a major local brokerage said .
Japan 's securities watchdog filed complaints with prosecutors on Tuesday alleging that Nomura Securities Co Ltd , Japan 's biggest brokerage , and three former executives made illegal to payments to a client.While the regulators did not identify the client , he is believed to be one of Japan 's sokaiya racketeers , who extort money from corporations by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings.Japan 's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to such racketeers since 1982.Government sources said that the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission ( SESC ) complaints allege that Nomura and the employees made illegal payments to the client totalling 49.7 million yen ( $ 417,600 ) .It was the first time that regulators have charged that the company was itself involved in the scandal .
Nomura has repeatedly denied any participation in the scam , saying it was the work of three former executives.It is now up to prosecutors to determine if there is enough evidence to file charges in the case.In a sign that the probe may have a sweeping impact on Nomura , the SESC said that some of the improper orders were handled by more junior employees , which could bring more names into the scandal.Nomura issued a statement apologising for the scandal.We deeply apologise for the inconvenience the scandal has caused to our customers and the public , it said.We are taking the complaints seriously ... We will make a 'fresh start ' to prevent a recurrence of such events.The government sources said the SESC would start drawing up proposals for civil penalties against Nomura immediately .
But they added that it was too early to say how long it would take the SESC to present the proposals to the Finance Ministry.Market sources say the Finance Ministry may suspend part of Nomura 's operations , including stock dealing on its own account , for about three months as punishment for the scandal.This would be the heaviest ever penalty imposed on a securities firm in Japan.The scandal has already casted a long shadow over Nomura 's business and prompted many clients to shun the financial powerhouse.In March alone , Nomura 's current profit dropped to about half the usual monthly levels due to the scandal , which cut its brokerage commissions and its share of the underwriting market , a company executive said in April.Nomura 's share of trading volume on the Tokyo bourse fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February , toppling it from the top spot it had held since February 1992.In the first fallout from the SESC action , the Ministry of Finance said late on Tuesday that Nomura was being suspended from taking part in Japanese Government Bond auctions and underwriting activities.Nomura 's admission in March that two of its directors were involved in transferring Nomura money into the account of a corporate client linked to a sokaiya racketeer was a major blow to the image of the Japanese brokering industry.In 1991 , Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were found to be paying improper compensation to favoured clients .
Top executives at Nomura resigned that year over payments and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters.Nomura made a sweeping reshuffle of its top management late last month in an effort to win back public trust in the wake of the scandal .
( $ 1=119 yen ) Two of Japan 's most troubled banks took action on Tuesday to end their long-running financial woes , with one announcing a radical restructuring and the other finding a merger partner.The moves are seen as just the beginning of a drive by the the indebted banking industry to get ready for Japan 's emerging Big Bang era of financial deregulation.Nippon Credit Bank Ltd , one of three long-term credit banks in Japan , announced that it would cease overseas operations , sell off its Tokyo headquarters as well as other property and write off bad loans totalling 460 billion yen ( $ 3.7 billion ) .Hokkaido Takushoku Bank , Japan 's 10th-largest commercial bank , meanwhile , said it will merge with the smaller Hokkaido Bank Ltd and cease overseas operations to become a super-regional bank.NCB said the restructuring will boost earnings by 50 billion yen ( $ 403 million ) over the next five years .
It hopes to gain 67 billion yen ( $ 540 million ) from the real estate sales and will also eliminate 600 jobs to cut costs.Despite the moves , NCB president Hiroshi Kubota told a news conference that he can not rule out the possibility of a tie-up or merger with other banks in the future.Earlier on Tuesday , NCB put three non-bank financial affiliates under bankruptcy protection.As a long-term credit bank , NCB raises cash through issuing debentures rather than taking deposits.The Japanese government , which has spoken of the benefits of deregulation and leaving the market alone , has taken a strong hand in ensuring that NCB survives , urging other banks to accept newly floated shares to help it rebuild its capital base.The Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) also said it planned to use 80 billion yen ( $ 645 million ) from a special fund created to cope with bad loans from the collapse of jusen housing loan firms.Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference that the capital increase and disposing of bad loans will substantially improve NCB 's business foundation and will contribute to the stability of financial systems both at home and abroad.Financial analysts have criticised the NCB plan , saying it would further weigh down other big banks , which are themselves in far from robust financial health.In addition , some said the moves were too timid.The restructuring programme announced by Nippon Credit Bank is quite drastic , but when taking into account the size of its massive problem loans , the programme falls short of solving its bad loan woes , said Yushiro Ikuyo , first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc.Hokkaido Takushoku said it had no choice but to retrench , ending lofty ambitions of being a global player in the banking world.We made the decision ( on the overseas pullout ) believing that it was inevitable to ensure leverage in our business while promoting bad loan write-offs , it said in a statement.Hokkaido Takushoku said it and Hokkaido Bank would merge as equals by April 1998.Both are headquartered in Sapporo , the largest city on Japan 's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.The merger will cut costs at the two banks and mean the elimination of 2,000 jobs.It will also help Hokkaido Takushoku face its mountain of bad debts .
The bank has long been considered the most troubled of Japan 's major city banks and a merger candidate.It 's a step in the right direction but they are taking two banks with huge bad debt problems -- merge them together and you 've got a colossal bad debt problem to deal with , said Brian Waterhouse , an analyst at HSBC James Capel.As part of the new focus it will shut down its six overseas branches in locations including New York and London and seven representative offices .
It said the withdrawal from overseas operations would have only a limited impact on its business .
( $ 1=124 yen ) A week after Japan 's top brokerage , Nomura Securities , said two directors were involved in suspected illegal deals , speculation is spreading that similar scandals may emerge at other brokerages.On Thursday , the share price of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd , Japan 's second-biggest brokerage , plunged on speculation -- later denied -- that Daiwa would hold a news conference concerning a probe by Japan 's securities watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission ( SESC ) .A Daiwa spokesman told Reuters that the SESC had been conducting an inspection since March 3 but that it believed the checks were routine and were not related to any suspicious deals.Two Nomura directors resigned on Monday after the brokerage said they made apparently illegal deals and funnelled funds to a corporate client which has been linked by Japanese media to a former sokaiya racketeer.The incident comes six years after Japan 's securities industry , including Nomura and other Big Four brokerages , was hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients.Top executives at Nomura and Nikko Securities Co Ltd resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters.Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto took Nomura to task on Thursday for damaging the reputation of Japan 's brokerage industry and confidence in the stock market.I can not use any other words except 'extremely regrettable ' , Hashimoto said .
I want Nomura at least to be aware again of the damage it has done to confidence in ( Japan 's ) securities industry in international society.Hashimoto resigned as finance minister in 1991 over his ministry 's failure to prevent the brokerage scandal and the SESC was set up in 1992 to improve industry surveillance.Government and industry sources expressed regret that speculation over a potentially widening scandal had emerged but were tightlipped about any ongoing investigations.Salesmen at other Big Four brokerages are also fielding questions from customers worried about a wider scandal.Our salesmen told me that customers have been asking whether we are involved in scandals as Nomura is , an official at one Big Four brokerage said .
We must be patient about such doubts ... but it is irritating and we are really upset.Some industry analysts also fear history may repeat itself .
We may also see a wider investigation into this matter vis-a-vis other securities companies in Japan , said James Fiorillo , a financial analyst at ING Baring Securities.Nomura is already suffering repercussions from the incident , although the official probe has yet to be concluded .
Major Japanese asset management firms , big trust banks and life insurers have suspended business dealings with Nomura , and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp said it would take steps to alter its business ties with the brokerage.Japan 's Postal Life Insurance Bureau ( Kampo ) and Finance Ministry officials are waiting for the outcome of the SESC probe before deciding whether to suspend their bond business with Nomura , and other major Nomura clients also said they are watching the outcome of the SESC 's probe.It is actually a big blow on our business , said a Nomura official , who declined to be named .
Even before the SESC probe is concluded and the Finance Ministry decides to impose penalties , institutional investors have begun to punish us .
Convicts leading a riot , in which at least five guards died , demanded on Friday to be flown out of a jail in northern Colombia by helicopter to an undisclosed location , the regional human rights ombudsman said.The inmates , some convicted leftist guerrillas and others former police officers , requested 10 parachutes , while one man , a jailed leader of the now defunct M-19 rebel group , demanded political exile in Cuba , ombudsman Carmen Quintero said.About 550 prisoners seized control of the jail compound in Valledupar , in Cesar province , after taking weapons from prison guards on Thursday evening.A National Prison Institute ( INPEC ) spokeswoman said the prisoners had taken 16 hostages , including the jail 's deputy director and a 14-year-old girl.The prisoners are demanding vehicles to leave the jail and two helicopters with 10 parachutes .
They have not said where they want to fly to but said they would take the hostages with them as a guarantee , Quintero told reporters outside the jail.Provincial governor Mauricio Pimiento , part of the delegation trying to mediate the crisis , said he would not discuss the inmates ' demands until they had freed their hostages and allowed all the dead and injured to be removed from the compound.A prisoner has reported that five guards are dead ... , a spokeswoman for the prison said.The inmates allowed an ambulance into the prison for some of the five inmates and jail guards injured in the initial shootout.Police and soldiers surrounded the prison and fired bullets and tear gas over the walls but were ordered not to enter for fear of inflaming the situation , the spokeswoman said.We are holding our fire and have merely formed three security cordons around the jail , a police spokesman later told Reuters by phone from Valledupar.Col .
Rafael Pardo , head of national prisons , said there was no independent confirmation of the number of dead and injured because inmates had barred the security forces from entering the jail.In addition to the small group of prisoners looking to break out of the jail , other inmates are demanding an end to prison overcrowding and improved living conditions.The Valledupar prison is designed to house 200 convicts but more than 550 are imprisoned there .
Earlier this week , Justice Minister Carlos Medellin admitted chronic overcrowding had turned Colombia 's jails into a seedbed for corruption and violence.Across Colombia , 40,000 inmates are housed in facilities designed for 30,000 prisoners.If news of the deaths was confirmed , it would be the worst in a string of prison disturbances this year .
Last week , more than 2,000 inmates , led by leftist guerrillas , rioted and started fires in Bogota 's La Modelo jail in protest at prison overcrowding.Another convict died in the top-security wing of Bogota 's La Picota jail when a bomb he was making in his cell exploded .
Prisoners have rioted in at least three provincial jails so far this year .
The army began stationing troops in strategic areas of Colombia as union leaders warned that the state workers ' strike due to begin at midnight on Monday could unleash a nationwide civic protest.The indefinite work stoppage by about 800,000 state employees looked set to be the largest protest since 1977 .
The government feared leftist guerrilla movements were planning a wave of attacks to coincide with the strike and said rebels could try to infilitrate demonstrations.Education Minister Jaime Nino cancelled all classes in state-run schools and universities to prevent any risk to teachers and students as unions continued to make last-minute plans for the nationwide shutdown.State workers called the strike to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike , compared to the government 's weighted 13.5 percent wage offer .
They were also protesting the whittling away of labour rights and plans for the privatisation of national and regional industries.It has been a long time since the unions have really fought against the government and it 's difficult to say how long this strike will last .
The workers and the government are very far apart on their demands , said Gustavo Triana , one of the heads of the main oil workers ' union USO , known for its combative , fiercely nationalistic stance.I think what we 're building up to is a nationwide civic protest , which will involve not only state workers but also the private sector and social groups , he added.Government ministers and defence chiefs spent much of Monday morning huddled in an emergency security summit to discuss measures to combat street protests and the possible blockade of major highways.After the morning summit , Defence Minister Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez told reporters : We will be stepping up airborne patrols over the major urban areas and along the nation 's main highways .
Urban intelligence gathering operations will be stepped up to detect terrorist acts.Orderly public demonstrations will be permitted but we will take firm measures to stop subversive elements taking part in the strike , he added.The strike threatened to severely disrupt air traffic , oil production , at least by the state-run oil company Ecopetrol , and telecommunications , labour leaders said on Monday.All members of the armed forces including police were ordered back to barracks on Sunday .
Gonzalez said police and troops would be sent in to boost security at airports and to set up roadside checkpoints across the country , including at the main entry points to the capital.A heavy military presence was also destined for the main oil production centre of Barrancabermeja -- the power centre of the USO , one of the most radical of Colombia 's unions.Political analysts said the public sector strike could spark a groundswell of social unrest from groups not directly involved in the action but ruled out any direct parallels with the political chaos in Ecuador , which began with a general strike and ended in the ouster of President Abdala Bucaram.The opposition Conservative Party was backing the protest as was the Communist Party , which had strong ties to both the public and private sector labour movement.The last major national strike in Colombia took place in September 1977 .
At least 20 workers died in a single day of protest in Bogota .
Horacio Serpa , Colombia 's Interior Minister and the strongman of President Ernesto Samper 's administration , resigned on Tuesday to prepare his bid for the presidency.In accepting Serpa 's public letter of resignation , Samper wished his right-hand man every success in your new activities in a laudatory reply made available to the media.Long ago , I took the commitment to serve the country in public office and I wish to continue that task ...
I present my resignation from my current post , Serpa said in his letter to Samper that revealed the pair 's close political and personal friendship.The move comes less than a week before the May 31 deadline by which prospective candidates must step down from public office if they wish to run in the May 1998 elections to choose Samper 's successor.Serpa , 53 , a ruling Liberal Party member , has been at the helm of the Interior Ministry since Samper took office in August 1994 .
An able politician and fiery public speaker , Serpa earned himself a reputation as the president 's staunchest ally , defending him against accusations that he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug money from the infamous Cali cartel.Samper was cleared of wrongdoing in a congressional inquiry last year .
But Serpa , one of the campaign organisers , is still under investigation on suspicion of knowingly accepting illicit donations.These years have been a great and difficult experience .
There has never been so much controversy or such acute confrontations , Serpa said in his letter , in reference to the drug-funding scandal that has dogged most of Samper 's rule.In addition to rounding on Samper 's opponents at home , Serpa launched outspoken attacks against the president 's fiercest international critic -- the United States.He recently dubbed U.S .
Ambassador Myles Frechette , a sick gringo for what he claimed was the envoy 's constant meddling in Colombia 's internal affairs , especially those relating to anti-drug policy.In the letter accepting his minister 's resignation , Samper wrote : In these times devoid of values and ideals , your brave attitudes against violence , corruption ... or in defence of sovereignty are refreshing examples of a clean career.Recent opinions polls show Serpa lagging behind the former Chief Prosecutor turned presidential candidate Alfonso Valdivieso , a thorn in the side of Samper 's administration for his pursuit of political corruption.But Valdivieso , also a Liberal , shunned his party 's backing and announced that he would run as an independent .
Serpa , meanwhile , is likely to be able to count on the full political and financial support of the well-greased party machinery , which political analysts believe will greatly strengthen his hand as the presidential campaign gets into full swing .
Moves to secure the release of about 60 Colombian soldiers held by leftist guerrillas could be hampered by failure to agree on the international character of a team to mediate the handover , a Red Cross spokesman said on Monday.Perhaps the most complicated element ( of creating a mediation commission ) is whether to view it as a national or an international issue , a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said.The important thing for us is that these people are released as quickly as possible and in good health.Just one day before the deadline set by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) for creation of the commission , the guerrillas have still not nominated their own delegates to oversee the release of the prisoners , captured during a raid in southern Putumayo province on Aug. 30.In a telephone interview on Monday , Marco Leon Calarca , part of the FARC 's general secretariat based in Mexico , said they would propose Guatemalan Nobel prize winner Rigoberta Menchu.But it was uncertain how far the government would allow the FARC to use the release of the prisoners as a chance to publicise its guerrilla war to an international audience .
Some analysts believe the FARC wants to use the release to show it is a genuine guerrilla army , not terrorists and drug traffickers as charged by Colombia 's government and military.But the government is keen to treat its fight against left-wing guerrillas as a largely domestic affair and it has insisted there is nothing to negotiate when it comes to the prisoners ' release.We want to set up a commission that carries real weight so that the government is forced to create the right conditions for the handover , Leon Calarca said .
We want both an international and national presence.Once the commission is formed it will negotiate the timetable for the soldiers ' release and witness the handover.The troops were seized in an attack on a jungle camp in Las Delicias in which 27 soldiers were killed .
It marked the start of one of the bloodiest guerrilla offensives in decades.The government has nominated three people to the panel , Bishop of Bogota Monsignor Pedro Rubiano , former Foreign Minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo and ex-Sen. Alvaro Leyva .
Colombia prepared on Sunday for the start of a nationwide strike on Tuesday that promises to be the largest in 20 years , according to labor leaders and the security forces.Talks between union chiefs and government ministers aimed at averting the stoppage by more than 800,000 state workers broke down in the early hours on Sunday.State workers were demanding a 21.5 percent pay hike , compared to the weighted 13.5 percent government pay offer , and were protesting at what they say are the whittling away of labor rights and government plans for the privatization of state-run industries.The government issued a communique on Sunday saying : The salary demands far exceed the government 's current financial capacity ...
The suspension of national and regional privatization processes would affect the improvement of efficiency of public services.The unions began drawing up last minute plans for the nationwide shutdown that could paralyze all but essential public services.The police and armed forces , meanwhile , announced beefed-up security measures to curb radical protest and what they say is the possibility of leftist guerrilla attacks , timed to coincide with the industrial action.A police spokesman said roadside checkpoints would be set up across the country and at key entry points to the capital .
In many cities , local authorities imposed blanket bans on carrying firearms and banned motorcyclists from carrying passengers.Colombian contract killers sometimes gun down their victims from the back of a motorcycle.The government 's lack of respect and claims of guerrilla infiltration show it is trying to discredit the labor movement , said Wilson Borja , head of the main public sector union FENALTRASE.Because of the arbitrary behavior of the police and the military , we believe the security forces will try and stir up trouble against the workers , he added.A decision by the chief prosecutor 's office to reopen investigations against 16 telephone workers for actions during a strike four years ago and the recent arrest of more than 10 oil workers , accused of links to the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) , Colombia 's second largest guerrilla force , further incensed union bosses.Political analysts and newspaper columnists drew tentative parallels with Ecuador 's reigning political crisis , which began with a 48-hour general strike and ended with the ouster of President Abdala Bucaram.I do n't think anything similar to Ecuador will happen here .
It would be strange that citizens who have not mobilized in two years of political crisis did so now ... but one can not completely rule out the possibility that the union protest could be the detonator for the ill-feeling that has built up in many sectors of society , wrote Enrique Santos , one of the heads of Colombia 's leading El Tiempo newspaper .
Colombian public sector workers began a nationwide strike on Tuesday , disrupting air traffic , transportation , telecommunications and other services.Security was tight in the capital Bogota in what union leaders said could be the country 's biggest labour dispute in 20 years .
About 800,000 public sector workers were expected to join the protest action , union leaders said.The government warned that leftist guerrilla groups were planning a wave of attacks to coincide with the strike.But apart from the pre-dawn torching of a bus outside the central city of Ibague , there were no immediate reports of violence or serious acts of vandalism.National radio said that except for serious public transport shortages , services appeared to be functioning at or close to normal.However , the traffic flow in the capital was light , resembling a quiet Sunday afternoon rather than the usual hectic pace of a weekday.All state-run universities and schools were closed and long lines of people could be seen stranded at bus stops in working-class districts on the southern end of the capital.There 's very little transportation this morning , said a woman waiting for a bus in the suburb of Soacha to take her to a cleaning job in the north of the city.Heavy detachments of riot police and army troops guarded public offices in the city centre -- where workers were expected to stage protest marches late on Tuesday .
Police manned checkpoints along key roads in the capital.Ismael Enrique Arenas , a senior official with the state oil company Ecopetrol , said there was no immediate effect on exploration or production activity and administrative workers were filling in for trade unionists who joined the stoppage.Private oil companies working under association contracts with Ecopetrol were also unaffected , he told Reuters.State workers called the strike , which began at midnight Monday ( 0500 GMT on Tuesday ) to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike .
The government , struggling to cut its deficit , has vowed to hold workers ' to a weighted 13.5 percent increase.Bogota police chief Gen. Teodoro Campo stressed absolute normalcy in the capital in an interview with national radio.Police helicopters clattered over the north end of Bogota , apparently on the lookout for urban rebel commandos , and a column of four light tanks and two armoured personnel carriers was spotted by a Reuters television cameraman heading for the southern gateway to the capital.Francisco Hernandez , a spokesman for Bogota 's El Dorado international airport , said operations were more or less normal early on Tuesday .
I only hope we 'll be able to say the same by this evening , he told Caracol news radio.But some carriers , including Continental and American Airlines , suspended flights to Colombia as a security precaution since firemen had threatened to disrupt operations at the airport.Elizabeth Fuentes , a union leader heading a picket line outside a Bogota administrative building , said the strike would last indefinitely -- until the government bowed to demands for the wage hike and cancelled plans for the privatisation of national and regional industries.This strike is a protest against Samper 's economic policy , she told Reuters .
Those policies are anti-popular , they 're policies against workers and against the Colombian people .
Thousands of people who fled violence and were camped out in the jungles of northwest Colombia may soon run out of food and the risk of epidemics was on the rise , a Red Cross aid worker said on Wednesday.More than 3,000 people , mostly women and children , were sleeping under hastily constructed shelters or in the open air in a village close to the town of Mutata , in the violence-torn Uraba region.Many worried about the fate of as many as 1,500 relatives believed to making their way along treacherous jungle tracks , fleeing the fighting between leftist guerrillas , right-wing paramilitaries and the army in the Rio Salaqui basin of neighbouring Choco province , the aide said.We are rationing food for these displaced people because of the lack of supplies .
We just do n't know how long the food we have will last , said Adalberto Arrieta , of the Red Cross in the regional centre of Apartado.We 're carrying out preventative work but in these kinds of conditions of poor hygiene , epidemics inevitably follow .
There are just too many people in one place , he said.Multiple cases of diarrhoea and fever were reported and Arrieta said the refugees also risked malaria and cholera.The British government was sending $ 80,000 in emergency aid , including food and tents , to Uraba , which covers parts of Choco , Antioquia and Cordoba provinces .
But Colombian officials admitted they were ill-prepared to deal with the human tide.Interior Minister Horacio Serpa and provincial governors travelled to Mutata on Wednesday to plan government relief aid.The army , meanwhile , was trying to persuade the people to return home or at least prevent them from moving from the village of Pavorando to the main town of Mutata.Army commander Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett accused the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) guerrillas of ordering the mass mobilisation of peasants to create social chaos in the main towns of the area.A FARC spokeswoman said this week that the peasants were fleeing in the face of indiscriminate aerial bombardments by the army coupled with threats from right-wing death squads.We want everything back to normal but we can not go home until all those paramilitary groups leave , Robinson Polo , one of the displaced , told the NTC TV news programme.Across the Uraba region , some 7,000 people have been displaced by fighting .
In the last decade , the government said more than 900,000 people were forced to abandon their homes as a result of the country 's long-running guerrilla war.The army has waged an offensive against the guerrillas in Uraba in a bid to disrupt what it claims are key arms and drug trafficking routes in and out of nearby Panama.The guerrillas , however , say the army and the paramilitaries are waging a joint scorched earth policy to force peasants out of the strategic , resource-rich region .
The explosion that killed an inmate in Bogota 's top-security La Picota prison points to a brewing internecine war between jailed members of the notorious Medellin drug cartel , a prison source said on Monday.William Infante , a convicted contract killer formerly in the pay of the now-defunct Medellin mob , died late on Saturday when a bomb he was making in his cell exploded.A source in the National Prison Institute ( INPEC ) said investigators believe Infante , who was serving a 25-year term for the murder of a leftist politician , was preparing an attack on fellow prisoner Leonidas Vargas , an ally of the late head of the Medellin cartel 's military wing.We are investigating the possibility of vendettas between former members of the Medellin cartel jailed in La Picota .
It seems the bomb may have been intended for Leonidas Vargas , the source said .
He ruled out press speculation the bomb may have been destined for the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers and other capos of the Cali cartel jailed in an adjoining wing of La Picota.There is no way this device could have been used against Cali cartel members because there is no way the Medellin convicts can get through to where the Cali cartel chiefs are held .
The two wings are completely separate , he said.Investigations are under way to find out what type of explosive was used and how it was smuggled into the jail , supposedly the most secure in Colombia.The prison source said the reason for the dispute between Infante and Vargas was not yet clear .
Both had once been close to Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha , alias The Mexican , the strategist behind a bloody campaign of bombings and killings that infamous cartel chief Pablo Escobar waged against his rivals and the state.Rodriguez Gacha died in a shootout with police in 1989 .
The Medellin cartel was effectively destroyed with the death of Escobar in a roof-top shootout four years later.In a radio interview on Monday , Justice Minister Carlos Medellin warned that chronic overcrowding in Colombia 's jails had created a seedbed for corruption and disorder .
Last week , 2,000 inmates led by convicted leftist rebels rioted in La Modelo prison , Bogota 's other top-security jail , and there have been at least three other serious riots in provincal prisons this year.The National Prisons Institute 's inability to control the situation has created a seedbed for corruption and disorder ... it would not be surprising to see problems flaring in other jails , Medellin told the Caracol radio network.He said President Ernesto Samper may declare a state of internal emergency , which would allow the government to push through new laws to beef up prison security and cut overcrowding.In addition to the lack of security in Colombian prisons , as evidenced by the recent riots , U.S. anti-drug officials allege that corruption among prison guards is rife .
They say Colombia 's jailed drug lords continue to run their multibillion-dollar criminal empires from behind bars .
Sergio Cabrera laid down his rebel 's rifle years ago but he still draws on the lessons of guerrilla warfare to carve out his role as Colombia 's premier movie director.In the face of the big budget imperialism of Hollywood and the European film world 's lingering cinematographic colonialism he is convinced that he and his Latin American counterparts can conquer audiences by launching surprise attacks consisting of modestly priced movies with a refreshingly new focus.We Latin American directors must be like guerrilla fighters -- striking with surprise films -- and find a different way of telling stories with different actors and in a different language , Cabrera told Reuters.Few are better qualified than the director of Estrategia Caracol ( Snail Strategy ) and the recently released Ilona Llega Con La Lluvia ( Ilona Arrived In The Rain ) to talk of guerrilla tactics .
At the age of 15 , during a lengthy stay in China with his father Fausto , a Spanish Civil War refugee , Cabrera became one of Chairman Mao 's Red Guards at the height of the Cultural Revolution .
Three years later , back in his native Colombia , he took up arms with the Maoist-inspired People 's Liberation Army ( EPL ) -- currently the third largest rebel group in Colombia.During his four years battling government troops in the jungles and mountains around the northwestern city of Medellin , Cabrera followed Mao 's dictum that political power grows from the barrel of a gun .
Now , at 46 , he is becoming increasingly aware that a different sort of power is growing from the lens of his movie camera.NOT WIDELY KNOWN OUTSIDE ART CINEMASLike many non-English language directors Cabrera is not widely known outside select art filmhouses in the United States and Britain .
His first full-length feature Snail Strategy was released in the United States but no date has been set for the release of Ilona there.Ilona did draw favourable reviews at the Toronto film festival last September and was warmly received at the Sundance film festival in Utah in January .
The movie has also scored notable successes in festivals in Biarritz and Havana .
In the next few weeks it will go on general release in much of mainland Europe , a spokeswoman at Cabrera 's film company said.Based on a novel by Colombian author Alvaro Mutis , Ilona is set mainly in Panama at the start of rainy season .
It focuses on a three-way relationship , based on friendship , solidarity and sex , among Ilona ( Margarita Rosa ) , an international wanderer named Maqroll ( Humberto Dorado ) and an Arab seaman , Abdul Bashur ( Imanol Arias ) .
Ilona and Maqroll set up a high-class brothel to raise funds , which they send to their absent friend Abdul to buy a cargo ship -- a symbol of their desire to sail the high seas unfettered by society 's bonds.Ilona never lives to see Abdul 's arrival in Panama at the helm of the new ship .
She develops a strong bond with one of her prostitute employees , who lives in the rusting hull of a tug boat , and the pair die when the ship 's gas cooker explodes.FILM A POLITICAL ACTIn these times of violence and troubles this was a way of looking at our political problems .
Colombia is built on hatred and rancour and so choosing to make a film like 'Ilona , ' a film about love , is a political act , Cabrera explained.I fought with the EPL for four years .
But my dream of changing the country collapsed when I realised we were destroying not creating .
Now I see it is more important for me to influence people through smaller things.Ilona cost $ 3.2 million to make .
Cabrera is aware that a film about Colombia 's armed guerrillas or its all-powerful drug cartels may have been a bigger box office smash in the U.S. and European marketplaces , but he has taken the decision not to foster the outside world 's view of his homeland .
He has already rejected two offers to work in Hollywood.I do n't want Hollywood-style success , I 'm looking to explore new frontiers of thought .
Cinema must open the way to new experiences.That is not to say that Cabrera , due to start filming his next movie in August , chooses to ignore the current crisis facing Colombia , torn apart by drug trafficking and endemic corruption and in the grip of one of the bloodiest guerrilla offensives in three decades of armed uprising.When we were filming the abandoned ( tug ) boat I thought that was like our country -- both were full of ghosts .
Colombia is still fighting to free itself from the specters that haunt it -- violence , drugs , corruption -- and our struggle against them is much more difficult than we first thought , he said .
A German spoke on Wednesday of his kidnap ordeal in the jungles of Colombia and said he and his three companions , two of whom were killed , considered an escape on the day before the army stormed the guerrilla camp where they were held.Mardean Muzinic , a construction worker from Munich , and Manfred Kehrer , of Linz , Austria , were freed on Tuesday , a month after being seized by a 20-strong group of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) rebels as they crossed into the country on foot from Panama via the remote Darien Gap.But Kehrer 's brother Johann and friend Alexander Scheurer , also from Munich , were killed -- by guerrillas according to the military -- moments after army special forces attacked the insurgents ' hilltop base in northwest Choco province.We talked about the choice of escape Monday but there were two different opinions , Muzinic told Reuters in a phone interview from a military base in Carepa , in Choco.I was for taking the risk because I thought only half of the guerrillas knew how to fight , he added .
Like his companions , Muzinic received weapons training during military service at home and said he was convinced he would have been able to handle a rebel rifle.At least half the revolutionaries were less than 15 years old and had little idea of what they were doing , Muzinic said .
But the four friends had been split into two groups after the 10th day of their ordeal -- making it almost impossible to time a joint escape attempt .
They were only briefly reunited Monday to celebrate Manfred Kehrer 's birthday.The guerrillas told them they were demanding a $ 15 million ransom .
But German embassy officials and Austrian ambassador Franz Irbinger said they had no idea the men had been snatched until after they were released and had received no demands.I was sure the kidnap would last for months or years because we did n't have any money to pay for a ransom ... We were never sure they ( the rebels ) were telling us the truth .
We know they told us a lot of bullshit , Muzinic said.The four backpackers , all between 25 and 30 , finally opted to wait , fearing they could perish in the jungle if they made a dash for freedom through rebel-infested territory .
The area around was full of guerrillas .
The problem was where to run and which direction to take , Muzinic said.The four were abducted on Feb. 7 at the entrance to the Los Katios nature reserve , just a short distance from Colombia 's border with Panama.Muzinic said they were forced to march about seven miles ( 10 km ) a day along muddy jungle tracks on basic rations of rice and meat .
At night a rebel leader known as Saul would read tracts of Marxist-Leninist literature to his comrades.It was not like a real kidnap .
At times it was more like a guided tour .
Some of the rebels were just playing with their weapons like in a cowboy movie .
It was ridiculous , Muzinic said.But that sense of make-believe turned to tragic reality shortly after midday on Tuesday .
Muzinic and Manfred Kehrer had gone under guard to bathe in a river near the rebel camp .
The next thing they knew , the bullets started to fly and their captors fled .
Minutes later a small group of army troops appeared further down the river.The firefight continued on the other side of the hill , however .
In the hail of gunfire , Kehrer 's brother and Scheurer died and four FARC fighters were also killed.Regional army chief Gen. Ivan Ramirez blamed the deaths of the two tourists on the FARC .
Muzinic said he had not seen or spoken with the pair since the previous day but added : When the army came down from the hill they said the others had been shot by the rebels .
I believe Saul gave the orders .
He was a real fanatic ... a hardliner .
Britain 's opposition Labour party said on Monday that it believed problems at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management ( MGAM ) could have been uncovered earlier and warned other financial institutions to be more vigilant.The preliminary indications are the problem was not determined as soon as it should have been , said Alistair Darling , shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.Alarm bells ought to be ringing in all major institutions .
They should ask themselves if something similar could have happened , Darling said in a telephone interview.Trading in the three funds , which were worth an estimated 1.4 billion pounds ( $ 2.18 billion ) , was suspended last week when MGAM , part of the giant Deutsche Bank group , disclosed suspected irregularities in the funds and began a probe.The problems centre on the valuation of the high proportion of speculative unlisted high-technology stocks held in the funds.Trading in the three funds resumed last Thursday after a 180 million pound cash injection by Deutsche.Peter Young , the fund manager of two of the funds , was suspended and an injunction obtained by MGAM and Royal Bank of Scotland , trustee of the funds , to freeze his assets.An in-depth probe spearheaded by investment watchdog the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation ( IMRO ) is underway , and it has brought in accountants to work out how much compensation may be due to the 90,000 investors in the funds.Darling said the problems at MGAM showed the regulatory system was not perfect and there were still problems to be addressed , both by regulators and businesses.Good regulatory sense and good business sense go hand-in-hand , Darling said , adding that every large organisation should be asking itself if similar irregularities could occur within their own structures.While the Labour party stood by its proposals to make the Securities and Investments Board ( SIB ) directly responsible for regulating Britain 's financial community , it would not make any recommendations on the latest episode until IMRO had completed its investigation into the matter.The central question which IMRO needs to look at is how was it possible for these problems to arise , Darling said.The fact that a succession of such problems were blamed on a so-called rogue trader or dealer was also a concern , as it raised the question of how those charged with compliance or those in senior management could miss such dealings.I 'm concerned that when things go wrong the finger is pointed at a rogue activity .
Ideally we want a system where it is simply not possible for one or two people to stray off the path , Darling said.He also said the role of trustees of funds was a matter of concern , adding it was important to find a way of ensuring they are not only independent but constantly vigilant.The role of a trustee is to represent the interests of investors and to ensure a fund is managed according to its mandate.The public needs to be confident that these funds are properly managed , he said .
( $ 1=.6412 Pound ) British investment bank Close Brothers said on Monday its enlarged corporate finance business was exceeding expectations and helping strong fee earnings.The corporate finance business has gone much better than we ever dreamt , Rod Kent , Close Brothers ' managing director , told Reuters.The group earlier today announced a 30 percent increase in first half pre-tax profits to 28.2 million pounds ( $ 45.8 million ) , from 21.7 million the previous year.Close Brothers enlarged its corporate finance division last May when it bought Hill Samuel 's corporate finance department from Britain 's Lloyds TSB Group Plc.It said the integration had been very successful , with no material loss of clients or staff and had led to a leap in activity and profits in the corporate finance area .
Kent said Close Brothers now had well over 80 quoted clients , adding it was focusing on giving advice to growth companies.It is quite clear from the figures that we have got off to a good start on our corporate finance side , he said , adding the majority of an increase in fees and commissions from 9.0 million stg to 19 million stg had come from this quarter.Kent was also upbeat about Close Brothers ' other main business areas , including other aspects of what it calls City Merchant Banking.He said the asset finance division had grown to new records in advances and profits .
The division accounted for 41 percent of operating profits during the period , down from 44 percent for the same period a year earlier.And WINS , the former Winterflood Securities market-making arm , had a very good half retaining its position in the market place where it benefited particularly from high levels of activity in smaller company stocks.Kent said WINS ' small retail order gilts business had moved into profitability during the period , adding that worries about an order driven system were unlikely to materialise.Market-making accounted for 33 percent of operating profits during the period , down from 34 percent , while merchant banking accounted for 26 percent , up from 22 percent .
Kent said he was happy with the overall mix of business.Within the merchant banking arm , Kent said the insurance premium finance division PROMPT was going like a train and the group was making steady progress in its other specialist business.Asked about the likelihood of Close Brothers making acquisitions to grow its business , Kent said the firm would be patient when it came to buying other companies.We have clearly signalled our intentions to get something on the investment management side , he said , adding that on the basis of the high valuations of investment management companies at the moment , it would be difficult to buy.And Kent said he was not worried by the trend for smaller merchant banks such as Close Brothers to be gobbled up by larger expanding foreign investment banks.I have never been concerned about it .
Our best asset is our performance .
Ownership is in the public arena , he said.Close Brothers said it would continue to see organic growth in its activities but warned the forthcoming election in Britain could cause a temporary slow-down in some of its businesses.The group announced an increased interim dividend of 3.8 pence , up from 3.2 pence , while earnings per share for the period rose 21 percent to 15.31 pence from 12.64 pence .
( $ = 0.615 British Pounds ) Members of Britain 's third largest building society , the Woolwich , on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly in favour of ditching the mortgage lender 's 150-year-old mutual status in favour of becoming a publicly listed bank.After a special general meeting the proposals , which will give individual members a share windfall worth an average 1,200 pounds ( $ 1,961 ) , were approved by more than 95 percent of both the savers and borrowers who voted ... .We probably were n't too surprised but it 's pleasant that our members feel exactly the same way because quite frankly we 've put a lot of thought into trying to get this right , said John Stewart , Woolwich chief executive.Last month the Woolwich said the handout of at least 450 shares to qualifying members would go to around 2.57 million people , including qualifying members and pensioners.Around 1,200 members , many unhappy with the conversion , turned up at the meeting but the vote was decided by a large postal vote.Stewart told Reuters that Woolwich Plc , as it will be known when the 3.0 billion pound flotation goes ahead in July , wanted to offer a full range of personal financial services and planned to expand into areas such as pensions.That 's an area we will either grow into organically or we might make an acquisition ... he said , adding that the group was a bit light in weight in other areas such as life assurance and unit trusts.He did not rule out the possibility of acquisitions to expand the Woolwich 's business , but he stressed that if they happened these were likely to be friendly mergers , not hostile takeovers .
The Woolwich 's history is as a white knight , most people come to us because someone else is threatening them.Stewart said the Woolwich , founded in 1847 in south London and set to become a FTSE-100 company and one of Britain 's 10 largest banks , would also press ahead with building up relatively high-margin business in France and Italy.He said the Woolwich would not be looking at other European countries unless it was the right opportunity because it was already established and doing very well in France and Italy.But there are plans to develop so-called telebanking and electronic banking , the latter probably starting this year and telephone banking in 1998.The Woolwich is one of four building societies planning stock market flotations during 1997 .
The others are Britain 's biggest mortgage lender , the Halifax , the Alliance & amp ; Leicester and Northern Rock.Some members protested at the Woolwich 's plans to shed its mutual status -- where the building society is owned by its savers and borrowers -- in favour of being a publicly listed company with shareholders who expect dividends.A number argued that this would reduce the favourable savings rates which building societies have traditionally paid compared with their bank counterparts and increase make loans to house-buyers more expensive.But Stewart said this would not be the case as Britain 's increasingly competitive financial services market and the economies of scale from conversion meant the Woolwich would have to offer not only top quality service but also competitive lending and savings rates.Stewart told the meeting that Woolwich members should not get too hung up about being a bank , adding it had no intention of moving into commercial lending , international lending or investment banking but would continue to focus on housing finance and retail savings .
NatWest Markets detailed on Friday a shake-up of its global debt markets wing , shifting power to managers from Greenwich Capital , the U.S. bond house it bought last year.The changes , which are not linked to revelations of 90 million pound ( $ 144 million ) losses by the investment banking arm of Britain 's National Westminster Bank Plc in its options business , have established Greenwich managers in key positions.The co-chief executives of the new global debt markets division are Gary Holloway and Chip Kruger , a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters , adding that two senior NatWest managers , Johan Hattingh and Alby Cator , had left as part of the changes.Holloway and Kruger are from Greenwich Capital .
Holloway will be based in Greenwich in the United States and will be responsible for the U.S. and Asian operations .
Kruger will be London-based and responsible for European debt market operations.Greg Bowes , who built up Greenwich 's London business before the NatWest takeover , becomes head of government bonds , repos and futures and options.Other key appointments are Frank Canelas , who will head corporate bonds origination , sales , trading and research , Bruce Snider who becomes head of asset-backed origination , structuring and trading and Phil Lotz , chief administrative officer for operations , IT and finance.The NatWest spokeswoman said the shake-up played to both NatWest 's and Greenwich 's strengths .
The changes , which were announced internally on Thursday , have created 10 main areas of responsibility within the debt markets division.A number of NatWest managers kept key roles within the new framework .
These included Graham Rendell in acquisition finance , housing finance and syndicated loans , and Simon Collins , who continues as head of debt structuring and structured finance.Gary Mulgrew and Gordon McKechnie jointly head project finance , structured trade finance , and leasing and asset finance .
George Trott and Martin Jaskel head debt origination for corporates and all financial institutions .
Neil Coulbeck remains responsible for business management and portfolio administration.NatWest said Hattingh , who was European fixed income head , and Cator , who was managing director of European primary markets , had left as part of the reshuffle.Their departures are as a result of the restructuring of the debt markets division , the spokeswoman said when asked if the two had been made redundant by NatWest.Hattingh had been at NatWest Markets since 1993 when he joined from Japan 's IBJ .
With the integration of Greenwich , Hattingh was joined in European fixed income by Greg Bowes.NatWest 's embarrassing losses in its global debt derivatives division have led to the suspension of five senior employees and bonus cuts totalling eight million pounds for a handful of staff.Chief executive Martin Owen cutting his own bonus and the Securities and Futures Authority ( SFA ) and Bank of England are looking into what went wrong at the firm.One banking source described the effect of the $ 590 million Greenwich purchase as being effectively a reverse takeover for debt markets aimed at imposing Greenwich 's bond expertise and experience over parts of NatWest 's existing team , which had been struggling to build up its business in some areas.The source also said the discovery of the options losses , which were first announced two weeks ago , had been a direct result of auditing changes implemented by Greenwich managers.On Thursday NatWest 's Owen told Reuters that the interest rate options losses , which began in late 1994 , had surfaced as a result of certain procedural changes.At the time of the Greenwich buy , NatWest 's Owen said it plugged a major gap in the group 's investment banking strategy and would meet demand from clients for firms able to offer the broadest possible range of global fixed income products.Owen said Greenwich would give NatWest access to the world 's biggest market -- U.S. Treasuries -- and the growing asset backed area .
NatWest already had U.S. mergers and acquisitions advisory capacity in the form of Gleacher NatWest .
NatWest Markets is expected to deal firmly with anyone found to have been responsible for its 50 million pound ( $ 80.2 million ) loss on interest rate options.Sackings , demotions and bonus cuts are among the penalties banking sources have suggested NatWest could hand down when it releases a preliminary report into the affair on Thursday.NatWest Markets , the investment banking arm of Britain 's National Westminster Bank Plc , revealed the embarrassing hole in its interest rate options book nearly two weeks ago.A NatWest Markets spokeswoman declined to comment on the precise timing of the early findings of its internal probe , which have been widely expected to emerge this week.She said she could not comment on a newspaper report suggesting bonuses could be cut but confirmed the results of the inquiry may have a financial impact on certain individuals.NatWest has hired accountants Coopers & amp ; Lybrand and law firm Linklaters & amp ; Paines to assist it in finding out how the options mispricing errors went unnoticed for so long.Options are contracts which give buyers the right , but not the obligation , to buy or sell an underlying security at a set price on a set date in the future.A former NatWest trader , widely believed to be Kyriacos Papouis , has been reported by NatWest to British financial markets regulator the Securities and Futures Authority ( SFA ) .And a senior NatWest trader , Neil Dodgson , has been suspended for allegedly failing to supervise , pending the outcome of the probe.Dodgson , who has not spoken about the case , was not immediately available for comment.Papouis left NatWest in December last year for U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns .
He resigned from Bear Stearns last week and has not commented on his role in the NatWest affair .
There has been no suggestion there was any personal gain involved , but the affair has raised deep concerns about NatWest 's internal risk management.Bear Stearns last week declined to give any details of the Papouis resignation , except to say it had conducted a thorough review of his open trading positions and was satisfied they were all booked and managed properly.Britain 's SFA has been notified of the NatWest internal inquiry and has opened a file , while the Bank of England has said it is co-operating with SFA.On Tuesday the Bank of England , which supervises the NatWest group , said it was being kept informed of developments by NatWest.NatWest Markets said it was undertaking a thorough review of its control systems , both internal and external.Banking sources and British newspaper reports said this has involved examining the workings of both its interest rate derivatives department and its compliance division.Jean-Francois Nguyen is head of interest rate derivatives at NatWest Markets .
At the time of the mispricing errors , he reported to the then head of debt capital markets Phil Wise.The Times on Thursday reported that NatWest 's computer-based risk models had not been fed with accurate information which would have enabled any excessively risky positions to be identified.A key question likely to be asked of senior NatWest officials is why the firm did not reveal the loss when it announced its 1996 results only days before it made the surprise announcement.NatWest said it had brought the loss to the market 's attention as soon as it came to light , but some banking sources questioned why the loss had not been picked up when the firm prepared its 1996 accounts .
( $ = 0.623 British Pounds ) Elizabeth Forsyth , former aide to Polly Peck Plc head Asil Nadir , left court on Friday still awaiting the outcome of her appeal against a money-laundering conviction but enjoying her first taste of freedom in 10 months.The London Court of Appeal reserved judgment her appeal after a two-day hearing .
Forsyth , 60 , spent the last 10 months in jail after being found guilty last year on two counts of dishonestly handling a total of 400,000 pounds ( $ 640,000 ) .She was freed on bail on Thursday when the court quashed her original five-year sentence , which it said was disproportionate , and concluded she had already served long enough in prison.But after the conclusion of Forsyth 's appeal and arguments by the prosecution that the conviction should stand , the court said it could not make an immediate ruling on whether it would also quash the conviction which would clear Forsyth.We desire to reserve our judgment in this matter ... we will give our decision as soon as we can , Lord Justice Beldam told the court .
The three judges said they were unable to give an immediate result as the appeal had raised complex issues.The prosecution said the money Forsyth was convicted of handling had been stolen by Nadir from fruits-to-electronics firm Polly Peck , which collapsed in 1990 under massive debts.Nadir still faces fraud and theft charges in Britain after he fled to his native northern Cyprus in 1993 , jumping bail of 3.5 million pounds.Forsyth 's barrister , Geoffrey Robertson , argued during the appeal hearing that her conviction was unsafe on a number of grounds , including the fact that Nadir had not been questioned via a video-link from northern Cyprus and the money Forsyth had transferred in Geneva was not in fact stolen.It involves so many complex issues of law it was inevitable that judgement should be reserved , Peter Krivinskas , Forsyth 's lawyer , told Reuters after the judge 's announcement.Krivinskas said the appeal was a case which could set legal precendent , adding that it was difficult to gauge how the appeal had been received by the court .
We do n't want to tempt providence , he said.Forsyth , who on Thursday described her period in jail as an experience , told Reuters she would be returning her mother 's home .
I 'm going to go home and just relax for the weekend .
I enjoy the countryside and will go for a long walk , she added.Her 90-year-old mother , Margaret Macalpine , was in court to hear the second day of the appeal .
She told Reuters outside the courtroom she had been stunned when her daughter had been released .
We just could n't take it in .
We were very excited , she said , adding the telephone had not stopped ringing since.I 've had a quiet time while she was in prison .
It 's going to be hectic now , she said , adding that Forsyth had many friends who had supported her throughout.Lawyers said the appeal court 's judgement could take as long as a month to be decided .
NatWest Markets said on Monday that its senior management did not know about the interest rate options pricing problem until three days before the losses were made public.Senior management did not know until February 25 that there was potentially something of significance , a NatWest spokeswoman told Reuters.She denied a weekend newspaper report suggesting that NatWest , the investment banking arm of Britain 's National Westminster Bank Plc knew of the losses some time before they were revealed.The mispricings , which on Thursday NatWest revealed had totalled 90 million pounds ( $ 144 million ) , had come to light during the course of normal pricing reviews and it had not been able to put a price on the loss until February 28 , when NatWest estimated it at 50 million pounds.The initial discovery of the loss came to light through a more intensive review across the investment bank 's trading areas , but it was a month or so before the extent of the mispricings became clear.The options losses have been a painful and embarrassing episode for NatWest Markets and its chief executive Martin Owen , who on Thursday said he would forgo 200,000 of a 500,000 pound bonus as a result of the affair.NatWest confirmed a report that the girlfriend of Kyriacos Papouis , the former NatWest options trader whom NatWest wants to interview about the losses , also worked for the bank but was employed in derivatives marketing and had nothing to do with Papouis 's work.She had been given a holiday period because of the situation , the spokeswoman added.Papouis , who left NatWest for U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns , has not commented on the losses .
Since the affair came to light he has also resigned from Bear Stearns.He and five others have been reported to British financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority ( SFA ) and the Bank of England is also looking into what went wrong at the bank.NatWest Markets ' global head of options , Neil Dodgson , who was suspended from the firm more than two weeks ago when the losses first came to light , is among those who will come under SFA scrutiny.The others suspended last week were Ian Gaskell , head of swaps options trading for Britain and Europe , Christophe Lanson , global head of rate risk management , Jean-Francois Nguyen , managing director of debt derivatives , and Phil Wise , chief administrative officer and formerly senior managing director of capital markets.While the group has maintained that it does not believe any of its clients suffered losses as a result of the options mispricing , which went back as far as 1994 , the spokeswoman declined to comment on whether NatWest would try to recoup any gains made by counterparties to any wrongly priced deals.We have n't determined that that is an issue , she said.She dismissed suggestions that morale was low at the bank following last week 's revelation that the loss was nearly twice as large as initially thought , the suspension of four senior staff and the cutting of bonuses to a handful of individuals.We are doing really good business here , and we continue to do good business .
Everybody wants this to be dealt with properly and put behind us , she said.Britain 's Serious Fraud Office ( SFO ) , which investigates and prosecutes major and complex financial crime , has been contacted by NatWest but has not begun an investigation .
( $ = 0.624 British Pounds ) Superwoman fund manager Nicola Horlick announced her resignation on Thursday from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell ( DMG ) , leaving what she called a feeling of turmoil among fund managers at the German-owned bank.A spokesman for Horlick , who had been head of British pension fund business at DMG 's Morgan Grenfell Asset Management ( MGAM ) , told Reuters she had quit and was planning legal action against her former employer over constructive dismissal.Horlick had been suspended on Tuesday pending the outcome of an internal investigation into what Deutsche Morgan Grenfell described as a potential breach of her contract.The dispute was believed to revolve around allegations Horlick was looking to move and take staff with her .
It follows a scandal last year at MGAM over misvaluations in three of its funds and the subsequent sacking of fund manager Peter Young.The suspension of Horlick , dubbed superwoman in financial circles because of her ability to hold a high-powered job while looking after five children , prompted reports of unease among large pension fund clients at the firm.The row erupted only days after Horlick received news of a promotion to managing director from MGAM chief executive Robert Smith , a banking source said .
They shook hands on it last Friday , the source said.Horlick , in an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday , described disquiet at MGAM over the Young affair .
She said the promotion came after a group of fund managers who worked under her said they would leave the company unless she be given more authority.They demanded that I be given more authority .
They felt that things were in turmoil following the Peter Young affair.Young , currently under investigation by Britain 's Serious Fraud Office , has denied any involvement in criminal activity.The Horlick saga is said to have unsettled pension fund clients at DMG , but the company said earlier on Thursday that it did not expect any exodus of its pension fund clients.Banking sources also said DMG was confident other fund managers would not follow in Horlick 's footsteps and that there was a climate of loyalty to MGAM 's Smith.But DMG has been in the spotlight for months over the Peter Young affair , which has been costly as well as embarassing .
In December Deutsche Bank agreed to a compensation package of around 200 million pounds ( $ 335 million ) to make good losses suffered by investors .
Deutsche also saw its coveted triple-A credit rating from Moody 's dropped last month.In October Deutsche named Rolf Breuer , a 58-year-old investment banker , as its new head .
Breuer will take over on May 20 and is expected to fight hard to avoid the criticism and mistrust that dogged his predecessor Hilmar Kopper.Kopper never managed to shrug off the peanuts tag attached to him in 1994 after he used the word to describe losses caused by the collapse of the Schneider property empire , with which Deutsche was closely involved.Peanuts are just about the last word the British press have been using in connection with Horlick .
She was reported to have earned one million pounds ( $ 1.68 million ) a year.In the newspaper interview , she tells of a last attempt to solve things with DMG when she met with Smith on Wednesday .
The meeting ended up with me in tears and Robert Smith very depressed , she was quoted as saying .
Horlick said a request to be reinstated was rejected by Smith on Thursday , the FT said.There has been press speculation Horlick was preparing a move to Dutch bank ABN AMRO with others in her team , but ABN has denied any attempt of poaching a fund manager team .
It declined to say whether it had tried to hire Horlick.In the interview Horlick said , ABN AMRO is a red herring , adding : I completely concur with what ABN AMRO have said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6784 Britain 's Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday it had become involved in a probe into alleged irregularities at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management , the funds arm of Deutsche Bank 's UK-based investment bank.A spokeswoman for the SFO said the office was in contact with British investment watchdog IMRO , which would share any relevant material with the office .
The SFO investigates and prosecutes major financial crimes in the City of London.IMRO 's own probe into MGAM has already led to the suspension of two fund managers and briefly saw trading halted in three MGAM funds , which have around 90,000 small investors.We have been in contact with IMRO .
IMRO are investigating and will share anything of relevance with us , the SFO spokeswoman told Reuters.Trading in the three funds resumed on Thursday after a 180 million pound ( $ 280 million ) bail-out by parent company Deutsche Bank.Sources in both the British banking and fund management industries said the probe appeared to be focusing on links between suspended MGAM fund manager Peter Young and a UK-based broker , Fiba Nordic Securities.Young was not immediately available for comment.A spokesman for Fiba Nordic Securities in London said the firm welcomed any investigation and denied any improper relationship with MGAM.Fiba Nordic Securities has been a broker and valuer for funds managed by MGAM.British regulatory sources said the UK 's Securities and Futures Authority ( SFA ) had previously been examining the activities of Fiba over another matter.This had subsequently led to the investigation by IMRO into MGAM which prompted Young 's suspension.Young , whose own assets were frozen as a result of a high court injunction late on Wednesday , was suspended from MGAM on Monday .
MGAM announced on Wednesday evening that a second manager , Stewart Armer , had also been suspended.Young had managed two of the three suspended funds.MGAM said Armer was suspended on Wednesday evening following the discovery of a suspected breach of personal account dealing rules.A source close to the investigation said Armer 's assets would not be frozen and he was not a central focus of the probe .
Armer was not available for comment.But in Frankfurt a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said neither Young nor Armer had committed an obvious breach of regulations .
But both were hovering on the brink of a grey area , spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf told Reuters.According to sources close to the investigation , the probe is trying to determine whether the fund 's investments in unquoted stocks were valued above their real worth.British brokers said they had had few redemptions in the three Morgan Grenfell funds after trading in them resumed but the full extent of any exodus would only become apparent after a few weeks.We are not seeing any panic selling .
Redemption levels look modest at this stage , an MGAM spokesman told Reuters.However , banking analysts in Frankfurt said Deutsche had to tighten up internal controls to prevent a repeat crisis at its UK fund management division.Something like this can never be allowed to happen again .
If Deutsche really wants to be a global player in investment banking , then its control mechanisms must keep in step with its growth , said Vereinsbank analyst Natalia Grasegger.The fall-out from the MGAM investigation also spread to Sweden , where Young had invested substantially in unlisted stocks .
Stocks held in his portfolio fell amid concerns from Swedish officials about the impact of the probe on the country 's alternative stock market .

( $ 1=.6373 Pound ) Ivory Coast exported 16,307 tonnes of robusta coffee beans in March , against 13,527 in February and 20,903 in March 1996 , official shipping data show.Ivorian coffee marketing started later than usual in 1996/97 after low world prices in late 1996 , tighter bank lending policies to exporters and quality problems that slowed grading , exporters said.This year is slower but there is still plenty of coffee about , said one industry buyer , noting that the season opened in mid-November rather than October.The data showed 12,904 tonnes of March exports went from Abidjan , the main port , with 3,403 shipped from Ivory Coast 's second port of San Pedro.Cumulative exports in the first six months of the 1996/97 ( Oct-Sept ) season were 45,783 tonnes against 58,667 in the same period of 1995/96.Coffee product exports , from Abidjan , included 694 tonnes of soluble coffee and six tonnes of roasted coffee.Ivory Coast forecast a 1996/97 crop of 230,000 tonnes , against 180,000 tonnes recorded last year.Port sources put arrivals by late March 1997 at over 175,000 tonnes but said Ivory Coast would at least meet its full year output forecast.Some buyers are still sorting and grading at stores and say more coffee is still held in villages.But they said the quality of coffee sacks had also been poor in some areas due a shortage of supply from exporters .
Piles of loose coffee awaiting grading could be seen in upcountry buyers ' stores last week. -- Matthew Bunce , Abidjan Newsroom +225 21 90 90 War baby Yegue Badigue was born at one of Chad 's darkest hours.To make matters worse , a hereditary defect struck him blind when he was little more than a year old.But the boy who entered the world as Libyan and Chadian forces fought over the sprawling desert nation 's capital in 1980 had a hidden talent -- the gift of music.We started Yegue off on Do-Re-Mi and he just started improvising with melodies , his father Jean Badigue , a soldier and director of Chad 's army band , told Reuters .
Then we gave him a harmonica and soon realised he was no ordinary child.Today , Yegue 's musical talent is helping build bridges within the former French colony 's blind community -- which some say is the world 's largest as a percentage of the population.His teachers , who have brought together children from Chad 's rival Moslem and Christian communities , offer his case as a symbol of hope -- in a country starting to enjoy relative stability after decades of civil war or conflict with Libya.He joined the first of our mixed-religion classes and learned the piano in five years flat , said Roman Catholic Archbishop Jean Williet , who took over N'Djamena 's diocese in 1986 and has taken a special interest in his case.MUSIC HOLDS US TOGETHERWe can not see each other so music for us is as solid as sight for others .
It holds us together , said Yegue , 16 , who is dependent on others -- until he sits at his piano.Williet runs three blind centres around the capital.We had to do something as no one had ever reached out to the blind community , he said , bouncing his battered Peugeot through dusty backstreets from school to school .
Chad after all has the highest blind population per head in the world.World Health Organisation figures show that 135,000 of Chad 's 6.5 million are blind -- a third of them aged under 20 .
Many live by begging.Williet says many cases of blindness are preventable.Children become blind because of untreated early diseases such as chickenpox , measles and dangerous concoctions prescribed to clear symptoms , he adds .
Poor hygiene is a factor.Others , like Yegue , simply go blind for hereditary reasons.Williet started Yegue on the piano by guiding his hands over a piano keyboard to teach him elementary theory and practice by feel and sound.We had an old Russian grand in those days but later scraped together the money for an electric piano so we could take it about with us , Williet said.PLAYS TO INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCESBefore long Yegue was lifting the roof of N'Djamena 's vast Notre Dame cathedral with the strains of Bach , Mozart or the Little Prince of Africa -- a piece composed by Williet himself.Yegue , little over five feet ( 1.5 metres ) tall and as thin as a reed , now plays to international audiences at the capital 's plushest hotels.He played to a 400-strong audience of Lion 's Club charities at Christmas , said Williet .
They were dumb-struck.Yegue is one of 55 students aged from six to 20 in Williet 's schools .
They follow a full curriculum ranging from maths , braille and French to carpentry and basket weaving.The aim is to integrate them into normal schools or a craft-based career .
Religious instruction is optional.Yegue 's father says his son will have to decide what he wants to do next.Yegue himself already has plans .
I hope to be a teacher or go to music school , he said , his eyes fixed blankly on a wall as he raced through Franz Kuhlan 's Sonata Opus 55.Other blind children are following his example.A full band of Moslem and Christian drummers , guitarists , singers and actors perform regularly in N'Djamena.He is a real symbol for peace time and how the community can work together after 30 years of war , said Williet .
Chad faces cereal shortages in 1997 but appeals for aid from one of the world 's poorest nations have met sceptical responses from some foreign donors alleging mismanagement of available stocks.Chad asked donors to replenish 50,000 tonnes of emergency cereal stocks in a New Year appeal by recently elected President Idriss Deby.In the 1996 campaign year , leading to the country 's first multiparty legislative elections in almost 30 years in January , Chad also acknowledged a shoot-to-kill policy against some criminals.Human rights groups told Reuters petty grain pilferers had been summarily executed for stealing derisory amounts from public markets.GOVERNMENT MAKING SHORTAGE WORSEDonors accuse officials in the arid landlocked state of making food shortages more acute.The half-desert country usually keeps 25,000 tonnes as an emergency buffer stock with another 25,000 tonnes for immediate emergency use.The problem is that stocks have been emptied for political reasons .
There has been a problem with donors about that , said Joseph Alain Charriere , the U.N. World Food Programme 's representative in Chad.That does not mean there will not be extreme hardship this year .
It is very bad but not catastrophic .
he told Reuters.The government says storehouses are precariously empty but the government 's opponents point to vote-buying.There are ways of making people 's lives more comfortable around election time , said one opposition party leader and former National Assembly leader Jean Alingue .
Do n't forget that 80 percent of Chadians live in the country and are mostly poor.CHAD SAYS SHORTAGE CRITICIALChadian officials say urgent action is required as women struggle to set aside private stocks at village level to tide over their families through Chad 's regular droughts.The Director of Food Security , Ali Adoum Djourou , told Reuters recently that shortages could last until October .
He cited a Rural Development Ministry report for December putting Chad 's 1996/97 cereal deficit at just under 200,000 tonnes.The United States aid agency USAID closed its Chad bureau last year as part of wider cuts while European stock donations have recently dwindled out of a preference for boosting grass-root production instead , say U.N. officials.Donors agree severe drought has hit the Sahel region but they dispute food reserves are needed , pointing to a European early warning study putting Sahel area shortages at 17,000 tonnes instead of the government 's forecast of 50,000 tonnes.While donors recognise the deteriorating food situation is serious they also point to non-cereal food alternatives left out of food need calculations.All the elements that can lead to famine are nevertheless there , said Charriere .
Output is down , cereal prices are rising , and transportation is difficult .
People will be forced to sell whatever they have -- goats and camels -- just to survive.PRICES ALREADY SURGINGPrices were already spinning out of control , even though some of that was caused by speculation.Normally we would expect millet prices of 7,000-8,000 CFA ( francs ) per 100 kilos .
Now we are seeing 12,000 CFA and we expect the price to rise to 15,000 or 17,000 CFA in 1997 , said Charriere.Chad , one the world 's poorest nations , puts its annual cereal consumption at over one million tonnes with output seen at 840,000 tonnes in 1996/97 , against 900,000 last year and a record 1.12 million tonnes in 1994/95.The population stands at 6.9 million from 6.4 million in 1995 and 6.2 million in 1993.FAO says production of one staple cereal , berbere , used in calculations could prove to be higher that the 90,000 tonnes anticipated.About 13 percent of the 200,000 deficit is really urgent , Chad director Pierre Gence told Reuters .
That would mean 25,000 tonnes.Donors say poor roads , armed banditry , and farmers switching to more lucrative cotton crops in the unaffected south have made prospects worse.Chad stepped up border patrols against rebel groups and smugglers around Lake Chad but donors say it is easier for some farmers to sell produce abroad when roads are closed by rains .
( $ 1=568 CFA francs ) Plans to build cocoa factories in Ivory Coast will take national processing capacity to 360,000 tonnes in 1997/98 ( Oct-Sept ) , in line with a target of 500,000 tonnes by 2000 , Ivory Coast 's commodities minister said on Friday.If you take into account Cargill , Touton , Cemoi , STF-CI , Orebi and Shanghai we will reach 360,000 tonnes in 1997/98 , commodities minister Guy-Alain Gauze told Reuters on Friday , referring to chocolate processors ' plans to build factories.Gauze was speaking after a meeting on Friday with the world chocolate trade body OICCC ( Office International du Cacao , du Chocolat et de la Confiserie ) on cocoa quality and supply.Ivory Coast is the world 's largest cocoa exporter and aims to process 50 percent of its annual crop buy the year 2000 .
It produced a record 1.2 million tonned in 1995/96 and is set to harvest over 1.1 million tonnes in 1996/97Callebaut-Barry will raise its capacity to 100,000 tonnes from 90,000 tonnes this year , so by the year 2000 we will reach 500,000 , Gauze added.Callebaut-Barry already owns two factories in Ivory Coast and accounts for over a half of Ivorian annual processing capacity , which is set to rise to at least 180,000 by 1998.Cocoa accounts for 40 percent of Ivorian export earnings but the government aims to diversify the country 's economy away from agriculture by encouraging commodities processing , mining and energy sectors.The OICCC was in Ivory Coast for the first of what it plans to be regular talks with the government on cococa issues , including bean quality and security of supplies.OICCC spokesman Tom Harison told reporters afterwards that he welcomed Ivorian plans to raise cocoa processing capacity to 500,000 tonnes , or 50 percent of annual harvests , by the year 2000 as healthy competition for European grinders.Other delegates were more sceptical.The question is how much the Ivorian farmer will have to give up to pay for it , said one , referring to tax and subsidy sweeteners to investors for building new factories.The OICCC sees world demand growing at three percent in 1997/98 and sees immense potential for extra ( chocolate ) demand in Eastern Europe and Asia.We believe in this .
We have put our money in ( to factories ) , said Harrison , adding that Ivory Coast was well placed as a supplier to benefit from stabilising or declining cocoa production in other major producing countries , such as Brazil and Indonesia.But he pointed to an ageing population in Europe , health concerns over chocolate and stricter advertising rules which he said threatened future demand in some regions.People are having fewer children , and children are big consumers , he added .
We are spending a lot of money to protect ourselves.He said producer country concerns over use of up to five percent non-cocoa fat in chocolate in Europe was a minor issue next to public perception of chocolate as a product which makes you fat and makes your teeth fall out.Gauze has fought European plans to allow non-cocoa fat usage , putting resulting demand for beans at between 60,000 tonnes and 200,000 tonnes.Ivory Coast fears a fall in cocoa usage would hit its bean and processed product exports -- a view not shared by some chocolate manufacturers in Europe and the United States.Future demand for chocolate is goind to come in a wider and wider range of products , he added , saying that the OICCC did not have a common position on use of non-cocoa fats.Overall cocoa consumption was rising despite use of synthetic and vegetable substitutes for cocoa fats , he added. -- Abidjan newsroom , +225 21 90 90 The 1996/97 cocoa harvest in central Ivory Coast could be earlier than in the main southwest growing area and more prolonged if good rains continue for the next few months , buyers in the central region said.October and November will be the strongest , said Daloa-based private buyer Antoine El-Hayek.A total of 950,000 tonnes would be surprising ... the harvest now depends on good rain before January , he told Reuters , adding , Mould is a danger .
With this humidity and no sun , drying has been hard.Other buyers expected main crop quality to be better in 1996/97 than this year because farmers could spend more time treating the smaller harvest.Forecasters predict a 1996/97 main crop of 850,000 to 900,000 tonnes against one million in 1995/96.Pod sizes on farms seen by Reuters between Daloa and the central town of Gagnoa suggested a relatively early start to the season and a bigger harvest in early 1997 than further south.But there was little flowering , indicating weaker March harvests.Good quantities of early main-crop cocoa were seen drying on the roadsides between Daloa and Gagnoa.Buyers said they were not stocking 1995/96 mid-crop cocoa and they had seen little being stored by farmers.There is a little in the bush , but not much , and that is ( being held by ) those who are not in a hurry for cash , private buyer Makkram Haddad said.Farmers are often squeezed for cash at this time of the year because of the cost of sending children back to school in October.The manager of a cooperative store in Gagnoa said he aimed to attract more cocoa by paying farmers a 30 CFA a kg bonus at the end of the season .
This would come out of the transport commission element in the marketing price structure set by the government at the start of each season.A large competing buyer had recently set up in Gagnoa , he added.He expected 1996/97 cocoa purchases in the Gagnoa area to be on a par with 1995/96 , despite lower tree yields.Marketing in the area had been disrupted by civil disturbances in the run-up to last October 's presidential election , he said.Pesticide use on farms remained minimal , according to the cooperative 's figures on sales of Endosulfan and Diazinon-based products , which were used to fight capsid attacks.The store manager said many farmers found the cost of a full spraying programme prohibitive .
Annual treatment of a typical three hectare farm would cost around 55,000 CFA .
French chocolate group CEMOI is building a new cocoa processing factory in Ivory Coast which will open in October 1997 , the company 's managing director said on Wednesday.The factory can process 60,000 tonnes of beans a year , Managing Director Patrique Poivrier told Reuters by telephone from CEMOI 's headquarters at Perpignan , in the south of France .
He put the cost of the project at 160 million French francs.Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual crop locally by the year 2000 to add export value and remove lower quality late season ( May-Sept ) , or mid-crop , beans from international markets.CEMOI 's factory would open at its full capacity but could be upgraded to 120,000 tonnes after two years , producing cocoa liquor and cocoa cake and butter , Poivrier said .
Work began at the construction site in northern Abidjan ( Yopougon ) on Friday , he added.CEMOI , one of Europe 's largest chocolate confectioners , uses 40,000 tonnes of raw cocoa beans a year and would sell products from the extra 20,000 tonnes capacity mainly to Europe and perhaps China.We are also looking at markets in China , he said.Poivrier said the factory had been planned to secure a regular supply of good quality cocoa and by-pass Ivorian commodity exporters.Ivory Coast already has three cocoa processing factories with capacity for processing up to 160,000 tonnes of beans a year.Europe 's Callebaut Barry group owns two factories .
Ivorian exporter SIFCA owns a third , with some share participation from U.S.-based Arthur Daniels Midland .
It plans to expand capacity by 21,000 tonnes by 1998.Several other factory projects are nearing final planning stages.U.S.-based Cargill will soon reach a decision on whether to go ahead with plans to build a 60,000 tonnes-capacity factory in partnership with Ivorian exporter SICC.There should be a decision in June , said a source close to the negotiations. -- Abidjan newsroom , + 225 21 90 90 Ivory Coast is planning to streamline management of mining policy to cut red tape and attract more investors to its expanding gold mining sector.There should be some big changes in about three weeks , a foreign advisor to the Ministry of Mines told Reuters .
Existing rules will not change but management will be tightened to make things run smoothly.Ivory Coast , the world 's largest cocoa producer , introduced a new mining code in 1996 to simplify rules for investors and broaden its agriculture-dependent economy .
Ministry of Mines officials said around 24 companies holding a total of over 55 exploration permits were searching mainly for gold and nickel.Firms rushing to West Africa since the Cold War ended have been attracted by Ivorian political and mining code reforms.Three new permits were approved in March alone but prospectors , and two working gold mines , point to bureaucracy which they say still dogs operations .
They want decision times cut and better coordination between mining and other ministries .
What the Minister of Finance and what the Minister of Mines says are two different things , Philippe Palanque , managing director of Ivory Coast 's largest mine , SMI ( Societe des Mines d'Ity ) , which is prospecting around its existing site.Administrative decisions are sometimes taken all the way up to the Prime Minister , said another exploration geologist .
Ivory Coast 's annual gold output of less than three tonnes a year is dwarfed by mining giant Ghana 's annual output of 40 tonnes .
Recent finds in Mali are set to at least double national production to over 10 tonnes , but underlying Birimian greenstone geology is similar throughout the sub-region.Ivory Cost had no mining experience like Ghana , so development has been slow while Mali and Burkina have raced ahead in the 1990 's , Joe Hinzer , General Manager at Ivory Coast 's other gold mine SOMIAF ( Societe Miniere d'Afema ) told Reuters .
Ivory Coast has good potential but discoveries like Ghana and Mali follow no rhyme or reason , said one geologist , adding that a find of one million ounces would be seen as good.SMI opened in 1990 and was privatised last year .
It predicts a gold production , by leaching ores with cyanide , of 1,523 kilos in 1996/97 after ouptut of 1,276 last year.SOMIAF says its production is set to jump to 935 kilos against 565 last year and has started feasibility studies for expanding operations in the next three years .
Newcomers are undeterrred by small gold ouptut , pointing to geological potential , infrastructure , and political stability .
( The mining code ) is not a star example but it works .
There are some pretty good tax exemptions , says Peter Pelly , geologist for South Africa-based Gencor which , with other firms , has joined a gold rush to West Africa.Exploration companies are given a customs duty waiver on imports but they say red tape delays securing the exemption.State participation in projects has waned however , with mining develpment arm SODEMI a candidate for privatisation .
In the last year since the mining act a lot of companies have gone straight into ventures without Sodemi , says Gencor.Mining firms arriving in Ivory Coast in the early 1990 's are still tied into joint-ventures but benefit from 30 years of mapping and prospection by SODEMI.Sodemi is improving as it gains more experience but at one stage we almost pulled out as the goal posts kept changing , said one geologist , citing problems over board representation .
Other mining and investment laws give the state a free ride of 10 percent of mining profits but allow firms to repatriate funds and dividends.Taxes are now levied at three percent of turnover rather than profits , while tax breaks apply for mining investments of 500 million CFA or more.Processing time for permits of up to 1000 square km , valid for three years but renewable twice for two years , was slashed from over a year to a few weeks .
The fiscal regime is also better but there needs to be more work on banking and accounts as well as uniform implementation of different mining code provisions , said one mine manager.Ivorian officials say relaxation of unwritten gold sales rules are being considered .
Gold from SMI is currently marketed at spot rates through West Africa 's central bank , ( BCEAO ) .We are paid the going gold rate but payments are often delayed , says Planque .
We can not raise loans against the gold or stabilise profits on the futures market , SMI , which is planning to open a new gold mine as part of a French ( BRGM ) and Australian ( Normandy Mining ) group , La Source , also wants clearer rules on illegal mining at its proposed site.At the moment there are too many , over 5,000 , artisanal miners from Liberia , Guinea and Mali , says Palanque. -- Abidjan newsroom , = 225 21 90 90 A Sino-French group has submitted a proposal to build a new cocoa processing factory in Ivory Coast to supply Chinese chocolate manufacturers , an Ivorian government spokesmen said on Thursday.It is a completely new plan which the government will study this week to clarify its position on financial support , said Philippe Mian , cabinet technical advisor to Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan .
The idea is still only a proposal.Managers from French cocoa firm Touton S.A. and Chinese chocolate factory owner Shanghai Collin met Duncan last week to discuss investing 12 billion CFA in the new factory , he said.Details were still under wraps but a new company called Societe Ivoirienne de Cacao ( SICAO ) would be set up if given the green light and enough government support , Mian added.Ivory Coast , the world 's largest cocoa producer , wants to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa production locally by the year 2000 to add more value and remove from export sale lower grades of cocoa.Ivory Coast 's inward investment arm CEPICI ( Centre de Promotion des Investissements en Cote d'Ivoire ) said the sponsors of the project had proposed an initial investment of eight billion CFA , rising to 12 billion CFA over about two years.They are looking for a site around Vridi ( Abidjan port ) , said CEPICI director Michel Koffivi .
We can not say what the processing capacity will be at this stage , he added.Plant construction could begin as early as September.Touton managing director Patrick De Boussac declined earlier this week to clarify factory plans after last week 's visit to Ivory Coast by co-director Alexandre Turincev and Shanghai Collin 's president Foo Sam.I have no comment , he said by telephone from Bordeaux.Formal factory proposals have already been submitted by three other investors looking at processing in Ivory Coast.An Ivorian-Chinese-French group under the name STF-CI had submitted proposal for a plant to process 15-25,000 tonnes of beans a year , Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze told Reuters last month .
That plant also aims to supply promising Chinese markets with semi-processed products.Ivorian exporter SICC and U.S.-based commodities giant Cargill recently opened talks over a 50,000-tonne capacity factory but sources close to discussions said a final decision was unlikely within the next three months.French Perpignan-based confectioner Cantalou , which makes CEMOI brands , has submitted proposals for a factory with a capacity of 60,000 tonnes of beans a year but would not give details until later this year , a Cantalou spokesman said.Ivory Coast is urging processors to use lower grade mid-crop ( April-Sept ) cocoa beans after constant complaints from buyers that sub-grade beans were being mixed in with beans for export.Gauze said in early March that Ivory Coast aimed to process 300,000 tonnes of its 1996/97 crop.Capacity is currently 200,000 tonnes but we are working on increasing this , he told Reuters at the sidelines of an International Cocoa Association in London.Ivory Coast produced a record 1.2 million tonnes of cocoa in 1995/96 and originally predicted 950,000 tonnes for this year before Gauze said in March only 800,000 would be exported -- partly due to increased local processing.Four factories with a ( bean ) capacity rising to 180,000 tonnes in late 1997 are already operating in Ivory Coast.Industry sources say over 130,000 tonnes of beans could be processed this year if factories operated normally.New processing capacity was unlikely to be on line in 1997 , taking into account application processing time and a minimum of six months to build a basic factory , one said.Private forecasters have put Ivory Coast 's 1996/97 crop at up to 1.1 million tonnes .
( $ 1=567 CFA francs ) -- Abidjan newsroom + 225 21 90 90 Ivory Coast 's cocoa mid-crop ( May-Sept ) could match harvest forecasts of over 150,000 tonnes but bean sizes are seen down from the record 1995/96 season ( Oct-Sept ) , crop analysts and exporters said on Thursday.The development seems to be coming along quite nicely , said one .
It is still early but I see no reason to suspect the mid-crop will be poor.Good peak wet season rains in June would decide the final mid-crop tally but this year 's bean sizes are not expected to match the mainly exportable grades ( 105 beans per 100 grammes ) seen in the record 1.2 million tonnes ( total crop ) 1995/96 year.Last year 's mid-crop ( 200,000 tonnes ) was exceptional .
I think the sizes will return to more normal levels , said another crop analyst , pointing to a range of 110-120 range with lowest grades possibly touching 150.Ivory Coast 's main crop reached around one million tonnes by the season 's closing date of April 27 .
Crop analysts expect the mid-crop to be down on 1995/96 with some early forecasts in a 160-180,000 tonnes range.Crop analysts said said plantation soil moiture levels had dropped in some areas after heavy wet season rains in April eased off in the first ten days of May.There was less moisture than I thought there would be , but it is not a problem , said one.Bean sizes would swell if June rains were sufficient.I do not have a pessimistic view of mid-crop , said the analyst .
As far as I am concerned soil humidity is average but our teams have not yet completed their tour.Crop analysts returning from upcountry farm inspections reported little harvesting and drying of cocoa .
They did not expect mid-crop arrivals at port to strenghten until June -- after a lull in activity between the main and mid-crops.What is there will sit around for mixing in with better beans and larger quantities .
It is just not worth the farmers selling yet , said one.Exporters say late main crop and a trickle of mid-crop beans arriving at ports are in a 105-110 range.Last year , even the tail of the mid-crop met export standards , said one .
Special contracts for grades outside the official export standard would still be exported.Discounts will be applied , as for poor coffee beans , but it will all be exported , he added.Ivory Coast aims to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa crop by the year 2,000 , partly to remove poorer grades from export markets , but also to push up world prices while adding export value.Local processors , with three factories , have a total bean processing capacity of around 160,000 tonnes.That figure could rise to at least 209,000 tonnes in 1996/97 as local factories build extensions and possible oil-palm factory capacity for cocoa bean processing comes on line.Other factories already under construction or in final planning stages could take Ivorian bean processing capacity to over 350,000 tonnes by 1998/99 ( Corrects from 1997/98 ) -- without taking into account a raft of plans in early discussion stages. -- Abidjan newsroom , + 225 21 90 90 Port arrivals of 1996/97 ( Oct-Sept ) Ivorian coffee totalled about 150,000 tonnes by March 16 compared to about 110,000 tonnes in 1995/96 despite doubts over quality , exporters said.It is a larger crop than last year , said one industry buyer .
The figures tie in with forecasts of upwards of 230,000 tonnes but as with last year marketing has been left a little later because of a large cocoa crop.Ivory Coast produced around 180,000 tonnes of mainly robusta coffee in 1995/96 and has slated 230,000 tonnes for 1996/97.A mild January-March flowering period in early 1996 and a peak in the strong-moderate-weak production cycle had helped boost the 1996/97 harvest , crop analysts said.Exporters said 120,000 tonnes had been taken to Abidjan and 30,000 to Ivory Coast 's second port , San Pedro , since the season opened in mid-November.Port sources put coffee exports to mid-March at little over 40,000 tonnes as sorting and grading had slowed port throughput , leaving warehouse stocks of around 100,000 tonnes.Trade is still talking about 230,000 tonnes to 300,000 tonnes but even 230,000 tonnes is big for Ivory Coast , said one .
Exports are still low so stocks have built up.Large volumes of cocoa had reduced available warehouse space from December until a wave of shipments against March contracts , exporters said in February.Coffee marketing usually picks up from Janaury as cocoa arrivals fall.One port source said quality problems meant that not more than 150,000 tonnes would be exported in 1996/97 , but others disagreed.There is now a lot of buying of all grades but the coffee is taking a long time to prepare for export , he added.Yields per hectare had risen this year -- with one plantation manager citing 600 kilos per hectare compared to 400 last year -- but grading was taking much longer.Exporters who fund upcountry purchases to meet export contracts ( Oct-Sept year ) said careless harvesting and poor sorting continued to be a problem.Markets were now being found for lower grades after a world price rally followed a slump in late 1996 , exporters said.Everything will find a way out so nothing will be wasted .
Some will be sent out to eastern Europe or other such markets , said one .
There are possiblities for black beans ( sub-grade ) but you never know what arrangement people have been able to make.Crop analysts recently touring upcountry farms said village farmers ' wives were still busy winnowing large volumes of coffee initially rejected by upcountry buyers.Farm union officials said coffee had had been badly stored after rains hampered drying in December .
Some cooperatives were still short of sacks for sending coffee to ports , one said. -- Matthew Bunce , Abidjan Newsroom +225 21 90 90 David Wellings , chief executive of confectionery and soft drinks company Cadbury-Schweppes , said the group was trading in line with plans , and still aims to be one of the top three in confectionery by the end of the decade.I think the word we used is robust , that means the business is performing to plan .
The base business is performing well and our acquisitions are also growing to plan , especially Dr Pepper , Wellings said .
I think that is the pattern ahead , a base business growing well and a thrust into emerging markets at a pace which management believes is reasonable , he added.Cadbury-Schweppes posted a three percent increase in trading profit to 105 million stg from its confectionery business in the half year to June 15 .
Trading profits from its drinks business rose to 198 million from 165 million.We have a very clear objective in our confectionery stream and that is to be one of the top three by the year 2000 .
That means we need to sell one million tonnes of chocolate a year by the year 2000 , Wellings said .
The profits increase was driven by the first full six-month contribution from Dr Pepper/7Up -- the third largest soft drinks group in the U.S. -- acquired in January 1995 for $ 1.71 billion.The acquisitions we made in 1995 are continuing to perform to expectations and that includes our Canadian acquisitions as well as Dr Pepper.Cadbury acquired Allan Candy for an undisclosed amount and Neilson Group for 108 million last year , making it the market leader in Canadian confectionery .
The company is the third largest soft drinks group in the world but trails in fourth spot behind Nestle , Mars and Suchard in confectionery .
Obviously there are areas of the world where we can expand more quickly than others like Eastern Europe , he said.Cadbury 's factories in Russia and China came on stream in the first half and Poland reached breakeven point in its second year of confectionery production.In the half year to June 15 Cadbury-Schweppes posted a 12 percent rise in pretax profits to 231 million on sales of 2.29 billion up from 2.03 billion .
In North America both confectionery and soft drinks will continue to grow and that is about lifestyle and the breakdown of formal eating occassions and increased opportunities to snack , Wellings said.So we will continue to see single digit growth even in the mature markets like the U.S. and the UK , but across Europe growth is going to be steady .
The French for instance still tend to eat two large meals a day and resist the trend towards snacking , Wellings said .
7Up volumes were nearly two percent ahead of last year after a relaunch of its design and advertising but still behind Coca-Cola-owned Sprite , as competitors stepped up their discounting and promotions.When it was first acquired 7Up was level pegging with Sprite and Cadbury is trying hard to turn the brand around .
The Dr Pepper brand , however , is outpacing growth in the U.S. market .
The company agreed to sell its 51-percent stake in Coca-Cola & amp ; Schweppes Beverages for 622.5 million which will greatly reduce debt and provide more scope for acquisitions , although Wellings declined to be drawn on what they might be. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437 Brewer to leisure group Whitbread Plc can expect to raise about 100 million stg from the sale of its underperforming retail sites in 1997/98 , said chief executive Peter Jarvis in an interview on Friday.We now have such a wide range of retail brands and a fast and sizeable programme of new openings , that we are able to dispose of older premises that simply can not be upgraded , said Jarvis.Recession in the early 1990 's has made consumers more discerning so that they now pick their favoured restaurants and pubs more carefully , he said.The company 's 1,700 strong Whitbread Inns , which forms about 40 percent of group profits , added 80 sites this financial year and sold 50 , with the modern sites generally much bigger and often designed to include a Travel Inn.Some of the company 's Beefeater restaurant-pubs are too old in design to be upgraded and other outlets are unlikely to prove economic over the medium term where for instance the local economy has turned down.We are constantly trying to improve the average within the portfolio , said Jarvis.The advent of a more flexible property market -- in terms of lease back sale arrangements and fewer freeholds -- and much improved property prices will also enable Jarvis ' sucessor David Thomas to accelerate the disposal and upgrade programme.He ( Thomas ) will be able to churn sites faster than I have been able to.He is likely to dispose of more in the next five years than myself.Thomas will take over as chief executive in the summer when Jarvis steps down.- Tim Farrand , London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437 British pub-to-hotel group Greenalls Plc on Thursday reported a 48 percent rise in profits before exceptional items to 148.7 million pounds ( $ 246.4 million ) , driven by its acquisition of brewer Boddington in November 1995.The year saw a good trading performance , both from the Greenalls businesses and the former Boddington estate , said chairman and chief executive Andrew Thomas .
Trading in the current year has begun satisfactorily , he added.Exceptional items charged in the year ended September 27 , 1996 , totalled 31.2 million , including 23.9 million for paying redundancy to former Boddington staff and re-organisation costs.Underlying profit before exceptional items and tax and excluding Boddington increased by 10.7 percent to 111.3 million.Boddington generated operating profit of 47.1 million in the 11 months after it was acquired and Greenalls said it saved 18 million in costs from integrating Boddington into the group.Overall group profits before tax and exceptional items were at the top end of share analysts ' forecasts , which ranged from 145 to 150 million pounds.However , Greenalls shares fell 7p to 597p after the company ruled out the sale of its De Vere Hotels.I suspect one of the reasons why the stock has come off is that they ruled out selling off their De Vere brand at this stage .
But we still remain positive on the stock because we see growth across all the businesses in a consumer led 1997 , said James Wheatcroft an analyst at Panmure Gordon in London.In an interview Greenalls managing director Peter Daresbury said the company 's outlook for the Christmas period was good.Christmas bookings are looking very good and there seems to be a strong level of consumer confidence , although the snow and the fog has not been wonderful for the business , he said.Christmas is a critical period for hotel , pub and restaurant groups in Britain and mainland Europe with as much as 20 percent of their annual turnover generated in December alone.The company plans to spend 170 million on developing its business in 1997/98 with about 40 million going on rolling out its Greenalls pub concepts.Profits from Greenalls Inns rose 50.2 percent to 78.9 million when Boddington is included .
Greenalls Inns operates 920 outlets nationally , of which 514 are managed food houses.Greenalls branded pub restaurants and lodges -- which include 88 so-called Millers Kitchens and 41 Henry 's Tables -- improved profits by 41.8 percent to 24.8 million .
De Vere Hotels lifted operating profit by 14.5 percent to 25.2 million as revenue per available room and occupancy levels rose .
( $ 1=.6034 Pound ) Business at hotel to betting group Ladbroke Group Plc is going well , with some flickers of hope that conditions are picking up at its 38 hotels in mainland Europe , chief executive Peter George said in an interview.The same trend has continued in the last two months .
The businesses are doing well .
It does seem to be getting gradually better this year in mainland Europe , he said.Earlier Ladbroke reported a 34 percent rise in calendar 1996 pretax , pre-exceptional profits to 163 million stg but trading profit from its European hotels fell slightly .
British oil and exploration company LASMO Plc on Thursday reported profits nearly doubled in 1996 was confident about the prospects for oil prices and group oil production in 1997.LASMO reported after-tax profits of 67 million pounds ( $ 109 million ) , up from 34 million pounds .
It declared a dividend of 2.0p , up from 1.25p.The figures were in line with broker forecasts of 64 to 75 million pounds , and the shares were up 4-1/2p at 243-1/2p just before the last hour of trading in London.We think ( oil ) prices are going to weaken in the short term , but we do n't think they are going to fall through the floor , the floor being around $ 15 or $ 16 a barrel , chief executive Joe Darby said in an interview.We are planning on $ 19 average for the year on Brent.The company benefited from the unexpected strength of oil prices in 1996 and tighter control over costs .
Average oil prices rose to $ 18.72 from $ 17.09 in 1995.LASMO reported operating costs of 2.87 pounds on average per barrel produced , down from 3.17 pounds in 1995 but still above its main rival Enterprise Oil.Darby said LASMO expected to reduce costs further in 1997 , although we are getting to the point where progress will be slower .
Just three years ago its costs were at four pounds , well above the industry average.Darby said LASMO expected to reduce operating costs further in 1997 although we are getting to the point where progress will be slower.LASMO reported 1996 costs running at 2.87 pounds on average per barrel , down from 3.17 pounds in 1995 , but still above its main rival Enterprise Oil .
Just three years ago it was operating at four pounds a barrel , well above the industry average.Peak production from Indonesia and initial contributions from its new British oil fields led to the highest ever level of production for the company in 1996.The company is currently producing about 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day ( boepd ) , but is confident of achieving its British household products group Reckitt and Colman Plc is expected to report a 15 percent increase in its full year profits on Thursday , as the benefits of its acquisition of L & amp ; F Products feeds through.Analysts forecasts for 1996 pretax profits range from 314 to 320 million stg , up from 285 million last time .
Estimates of the total dividend range from 21.8 to 22.6 pence.The group , known for brands ranging from Mr Sheen polish and Brasso , to Dettol disinfectant , acquired L & amp ; F Products , maker of America 's best-selling disinfectant Lysol , for one billion pounds in 1994.The real driver will come from the benefits of intergrating L & amp ; F , which will bring substantial cost-savings , said one analyst who declined to be named.At the half year stage , the company reported sales up 5.3 percent , although turnover in the United States grew more strongly at 7.0 percent .
In Europe underlying sales were flat due to sluggish economic activity and stiffer competition.It 's primarily from the U.S. , where we expect growth .
We have had encouraging signs from management in the last couple of months on that one , said an analyst.At the half year stage , pretax profits grew to 165 million stg from 149.6 million .
Turnover from continuing operations grew by just four percent during the period to 1.16 billion stg.The company continues to face competition in Britain and mainland Europe from larger retail chains selling cheaper own-brand products.Reckitt has targetted South America and Asia , where it believes consumers are more influenced by brand names .
Last year sales in eastern Asia rose by 25 percent , while in Brazil turnover jumped 20 percent.The company generates about 32 percent of revenue from Europe , a similar amount from North America and 18 percent from emerging markets.Reckitt shares have risen sharply in recent weeks amid market rumout that it may fall victim to a takeover bid by Unilever.But the investment community has now largely dismissed this , arguing that it does not fit the fast moving consumer goods sector that Unilever Plc has identified as one of its favourites , nor does it have enough of a presence in emerging markets.The shares have risen more than a pound since the rumours emerged , to the current 805p level and many analysts think this sort of bid premium now makes it too expensive as a takeover candidate.Our view is that on balance Unilever probably have higher targets on their list as in some ways Reckitt replicates Unilever in terms of its geographic exposure and I think Unielver wants to expand more rapidly in emerging markets , said Carl Short , analyst at SocGen.R & amp ; C 's stated aim is to become the world leader in household products and dominate over the counter pharmaceuticals.The company 's whose name used to be synonomous with Britain 's favourite mustard Coleman 's now generates only about five percent of its trading profit from food operations. -- Tim Farrand , London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 British household products group Reckitt and Colman Plc reported an 11 percent rise in 1996 pretax profits to 316.5 million pounds ( $ 505.5 million ) on Thursday , saying the underlying performance of the group remained solid.In an interview , chief executive Vernon Sankey said the group expected to see similar growth rates in sales and earnings in 1997.But the company 's shares slipped 3p to 782p as the figures came in right in the middle of brokers ' forecast range.Household products , comprising 80 percent of group turnover , posted a nine percent increase in trading profit to 283.9 million .
Earnings from the pharmaceutical division grew 12.2 percent to 67.2 million.The company benefitted from 27 million of savings from its integration of L & amp ; F Products in North America , which it acquired for one billion pounds in 1994 .
Lysol , America 's best selling disinfectant , increased its market share across the range.The lavatory care category grew by 18.1 percent in Africa and the Middle East , and most of the countries in Latin America showed double digit growth with Harpic .
Floor care products in Latin America achieved record sales , driving the group 's regional market share up to 49.5 percent.But economic conditions in Europe continued to be tough and sales overall were flat although margins improved , said the company.Mainland Europe has been relatively flat for most of 1996 and I think it 's too early to say Europe is turning around .
There are some reasonable signs .
France and germany are still very tough , said Sankey.The strategy is working , he said , which remains to focus on number one and number two brands with global potential , use the group 's wide geographic base and expand in developing markets.About one third of Reckitt 's business comes from North America , one third in Europe , a third from the the rest of the world .
Some 26 percent of business comes from developing markets of Africa , Asia and Latin America.If sterling remains at its current high levels on foreign exchange markets it would hit Reckitt by some 20 million on translation next year , Sankey said.Reckitt shares have risen by 14 percent in recent weeks amid market rumours that the company may fall victim to a takeover bid by Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever.But many analysts now think the bid premium makes the company too expensive as a takeover target.Sankey dismissed speculation that Unilever Plc would bid for Reckitt as just rumour , saying the company has not been approached by Unilever.It 's a rumour and we have had rumours for years .
We get rumours everyday , now quite frankly that is it , said Sankey.The company declared a total dividend payout of 21.97 pence per share up from 20.15 pence .
Including the foreign income dividend it was increased to 23.37p .
( $ = 0.626 British Pounds ) Peter Jarvis , who announced he would be stepping down as chief executive of leisure and brewing group Whitbread Plc in the summer , paid tribute to his successor David Thomas as an inspired retailer.He is a retailer .
He has been in retail all his life .
I am not a retailer .
I devised the retail strategy .
I was a marketer , I was in ads until I was fourty .
But David knows the retail business like the back of his hand.Whitbread is now embarking on a period of organic growth driven by its retail brands which Thomas is best suited to orchestrate , said Jarvis .
British sweetener and animal feed producer Tate & amp ; Lyle Plc issued a profits warning on Thursday as the strength of sterling on foreign exchange markets stripped 7.1 million pounds from its profits in the first quarter.Results for the half year to March 1997 are expected to be below those for the corresponding period but above those achieved in the second half of the 1996 financial year , said the company in an annual statement to shareholders.The company made pretax profits of 168.2 million pounds ( $ 272.4 million ) in the six months to March 30 , 1996 and full year profits of 276.3 million , down 11.2 percent on the year.Tate & amp ; Lyle said if current exchange rates prevailed for the rest of its financial year , results for the full-year would be marginally lower than the 1996 year.But Tate shares staged a recovery from their recent lows , gaining 10 pence to 435 , after remarks about the performance of its North American unit Staley were less negative than had been feared.The company said the currency impact resulted from the translation of foreign currencies and the EU Common Agricultural Policy currency mechanism.The revaluation of the green pound hit results at Tate & amp ; Lyle Sugars in the first quarter where profits were cut by 1.6 million pounds.Excluding this currency impact , profit before tax for the quarter was , as expected , below the corresponding period last year which had benefited from good margins in maize sweeteners in the U.S. , said the company.The company said results for the year in dollars at Staley would be in line with its forecasts because of reduced costs and a shift in production towards non-high fructose corn syrup products.Tate said high fructrose corn syrup prices remained highly competitive but management initiatives have reduced costs and directed production towards non-HFCS products.The company added that favourable trends in America 's sugar markets and reduced operating costs had resulted in higher dollar profits in the group 's American sugar companies compared with last year 's first quarter.It said the improvement would more than offset the expected downturn at Staley.The statement was n't as bearish as some had feared , said one senior trader.David Lang , analyst at Henderson Crossthwaite , said there were signs that Tate 's prospects were improving , pointing to the company 's statement that first-half profits would be above levels in the second half of last year.I think the market should take comfort from that .
There is a major turnaround coming , Lang said.If you take a long-term view you would be a buyer .
The recovery is starting lower than we thought and next year could be tough , but the long-term outlook is improving.The company said profits from its sweetener and starches operations in Africa improved in the first quarter.But lower production cut profit contributions from Australia and adverse conditions in Russia and Thailand hit results from sugar trading operations .
( $ 1=.6175 Pound ) The growth in fast-food , snacking and eating out in Britain is driving profits at food retailer Watson & amp ; Philip , owners of the 526-strong chain of Alldays convenience stores , said chief executive Colin Glass.And the trend shows no sign of abating , he said.What is happening is there has been a major demographic shift with an increasing number of single occupancy household or households where both people work customers are spending more on prepared food rather than food they cook at home , said Glass in an interview .
The company 's shares were 44p higher at 384p .
The product at Alldays will be consumed or start to be consumed within two minutes of the customer being in the store , said Glass .
As a result the company has adopted two strategies aimed at achieving profits growth.First to change the product mix to bring in more videos , fast food and drinks -- grocery and household goods now make up less than a quarter of Alldays ' range -- and secondly to open more stores , said Glass.The company plans to open about 150 more Alldays stores in 1997 mainly in the midlands and north England and to put Dunkin Donuts into 60 of its stores over the next month , he said .
Watson & amp ; Philip will franchise Dunkin ' Donuts from its owner Allied Domecq .
The company is also currently testing the Domino Pizza brand with its customers in six stores.Alldays reported an operating margin of 5.4 percent for the year to October 27 , 1996 , up from 4.9 percent .
Glass said the company had a medium term target of 7.0 percent margins at its 286 company owned stores , adding that margins at its 240 franchised outlets were likely to remain at current levels.W & amp ; P has a franchise agreement with Total Oil Ltd which will lead to over 50 Total owned petrol stations incorporating Alldays stores , at Total 's cost , over the next year.Watson & amp ; Philip posted group pre-tax , pre-execptional profits of 20.1 million stg in the year , up 11 percent.The company 's shares soared 44p to 389p , making it the stockmarket 's biggest climber so far today.Analysts had downgraded their profit forecasts for the company 's full-year results after it issued a profits warning in October , sending its shares down almost 40p on the day.At the time market forecasts ranged from 18.5 million to 21.8 million stg. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6437 A hardline Chinese magazine has issued a blistering attack on China 's most prominent living author and former culture minister in the first open salvo of a power struggle before a crucial Communist Party meeting.Really what kind of person is Wang Meng ?
begins the bitter tirade in the January issue of the magazine Zhongliu , or Mainstay , available on Thursday.What kind of role has Wang Meng been playing in China 's cultural , ideological battlelines and political life as a whole ?
said the article written under the pen-name Gong Yizhou , which means all in one boat.The article in the Communist Party magazine levels the virtually subversive charge that Wang Meng failed to support the rule of the Communist Party and has fallen short in battling bourgeois liberalism , a communist codeword for Western ideas.As a high-ranking official of the Communist party , have his words and actions met the basic requirements of a party member ?
it said.He has never written even the most basic self-criticism of this series of major mistakes on these important questions , the article charged.We are measuring a party member against basic party standards and this is definitely not too high a demand .
Should we tolerate party members with different views to ... look down on and make fun of ( the party ) ?
it said.He played an especially abominable role in mistakenly supporting the 1989 turmoil , it said , referring to the pro-democracy student demonstrations centred in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army on June 4 , 1989 with heavy loss of life.Wang , 62 , appointed minister of culture in 1986 , was removed from the job in August 1989 in a purge of liberal officials and those close to disgraced Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang.This is one of the fiercest attacks we have seen against anyone actually mentioned by name for several years in China , said one China analyst.This is not just an attack against Wang Meng , but against his people and against his successful re-emergence in the last couple of years , he said .
Wang was re-elected as vice-chairman of the Chinese Writers ' Association last December.A Chinese analyst described the vitriolic article as reminiscent of the language of the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution , when Wang was purged and sent into internal exile in the westernmost region of Xinjiang.An attack like this marks the first public step in the power struggle that is bound to lead up to the party congress , the China analyst said , referring to the crucial meeting due later this year that will see a major reshuffle of the most powerful players on China 's political stage.Such party meetings in China are almost always preceded by a bitter struggle for power and position and characterised by oblique attacks on leading players through those perceived to be their supporters.Wang Meng only laughed when asked to comment on the article .
I have heard of this , but I have not seen it , he said when reached by telephone.Wang is best-known for his 1957 novel The Young Man from the Organisation Department that depicts the red tape and rigid thinking of communist officials.He is also renowned for his award-winning short story Hard Porridge that involves a family , headed by an ageing patriarch , that has difficulty changing its ways .
Wang vehemently denied charges that the story , written in early 1989 , was an attack on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping .
China hit back on Saturday over a U.S. report that it had silenced all dissent by the end of 1996 , voicing firm opposition to such charges and accusing Washington of interfering in its internal affairs.The Chinese government protects and promotes the human rights and basic freedoms of all its peoples according to the constitution and relevant laws , and its achievements are clear for all to see , Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said.The Foreign Ministry statement was China 's first response to the annual U.S. human rights report released on Thursday that accused China of effectively silencing all public dissent against the Communist Party and government by the end of last year.The U.S. government turns a blind eye to the facts and distorts and condemns China 's human rights situation , seriously violating the basic principles of international relations , Tang said.China voices its firm opposition to this , he said.The U.S. side should stop its wrong methods of using the pretext of human rights to interfere in China 's internal affairs , Tang said.In the annual human rights report on 193 countries , the United States accused China of detaining , jailing or driving into exile all known dissidents.This year 's hard-hitting report was released during a dramatic improvement in Sino-U.S. ties that have long been rocked by disputes over issues ranging from rights to trade to Taiwan.Tang defended China 's human rights record , stressing that the government 's human rights priority was the feeding and clothing of its 1.2 billion people.At present , China politics is stable , its economy is developing , its society is advancing , its ethnic peoples are united , its people are living and working in peace , Tang said.The facts prove that placing the people 's rights to live and to develop in first place ... fits with the basic interests of the whole people , he said.Analysts said Beijing 's response was unusually mild , in a sign China is eager to keep up the positive momentum in cross-Pacific ties.However , the father of leading dissident Wang Dan said on Friday that China 's 1996 jailing of his son , a former leader of the 1989 student-led demonstrations for more democracy , was clear evidence of the kind of abuse the U.S. report condemns.All nations had the right and responsibility to concern themselves with human rights in other countries , said Wang Xianzeng , whose 27-year-old son was last year sentenced to 11 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.The recent Sino-U.S. rapprochement has survived Wang Dan 's last October jailing after a four-hour trial that was denounced by human rights activists as a politically orchestrated sham.New Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , who is to visit China next month , has said she will pursue a policy of inclusion rather than isolation towards China and , while keen to foster human rights , does not want to hold the overall relationship hostage to one issue .
China 's crown rests uneasily on the head of Deng Xiaoping 's anointed successor , Jiang Zemin.Deng 's death after an 18-year rule opens the door to a power struggle in the communist political elite , throwing into relief Deng 's major failure -- his inability to set in place a firm succession structure.Many diplomats and political analysts said they expected Jiang to tighten his grip on the top job after seven years building a powerbase under the wing of his patron.But the absence of a proper structure and the removal of his mentor leaves him exposed in one of the most precarious positions in the world.With Deng 's death the political ring of confidence that so protected Jiang Zemin has been torn asunder and he must now face an uncertain political future and political ills by himself , said Australian sinologist Geremie Barme.Deng was the last leader of China 's communist era who could back his claim with an impeccable revolutionary pedigree -- a founder of socialist rule , a victorious veteran of the Long March and battles that swept the Communist Party to power and a colleague of Chairman Mao Zedong.Jiang 's resume is not so impressive.But , aware of his weakness , he has devoted much of his time to building up his powerbase -- particularly in the military -- after his two predecessors were purged following student demonstrations.He has amassed the positions of party boss , state president and head of the armed forces.Jiang Zemin is a student of Chinese history and Chinese politics and he is very clear that the military hold the key to political power .
As the Mao Zedong dictum said , 'political power comes from the barrel of the gun ' , said Hong Kong-based analyst Tai Ming Cheung.But , he said , the military 's support is not unqualified and Jiang will have to provide additional finances and allow the military an important say.Barme said Jiang 's capture of China 's three top jobs was unprecedented in the 20th century -- but also dangerous because he was now the only real target for a takeover bid.Diplomats and analysts said that while Jiang appeared comfortable in the immediate aftermath to Deng 's death , he could not afford to be complacent.There is a lot of horse trading that has already been taking place , and with Deng 's passing it complicates matters a little , perhaps not significantly , said Cheung.But Jiang was now facing the real test of his career , and of Deng 's succession plans , diplomats said.It has been Jiang Zemin 's good fortune that Deng Xiaoping lasted this long , said one Western diplomat .
When Deng Xiaoping took power in 1979 an urban Chinese needed a year 's salary to buy a black and white television.When he died 18 years later , the average city dweller could afford a refrigerator , a washing machine and a colour television -- some could even buy their own home.Deng took over a China wracked by the 1966-76 decade of the radical Cultural Revolution and an economy stultified by three decades of Stalinist central planning.Let some people get rich first , Deng said in an axiom that underlined his rapid-fire approach to the economic reform that marked his rule.The goal of Deng 's economic reforms , which he first tried and failed to implement in 1960s , reflected his more pragmatic policies after Mao 's sweeping idealism.Both men wanted to keep the Communist Party in power but Deng believed that economic prosperity and money in the pockets of every Chinese would be a safer guarantee.Without a vision of his own to impose on society , Deng has been willing to adopt policies of non-intervention , wrote Barry Naughton in Deng Xiaoping : The Portrait of a Chinese Statesman.He dared to sweep away rigid planning in favour of free market forces , allowed private business into the command economy and decided to open China 's door to the rest of the world.In so doing , he saw the average per capita income of urban Chinese soar by 1,500 percent to about 5,600 ( $ 674 ) in 1995 from 316 yuan ( $ 38 ) a year in 1978 .
Earnings of rural residents leapt by more than 2,500 percent to 3,600 yuan ( $ 433 ) a year in 1996 compared with just 116 yuan ( $ 13 ) in 1978.On the world stage , its foreign trade has ballooned from an asterisk when Mao died in 1976 to 11th in the world and an engine of Asian growth in 1997.Deng 's first attempt at reform from 1976 to 1978 was also the first in a series of boom-bust cycles , a recurrent fact of economic reform for years .
The economy overheated and had to be reined in as Deng rushed to allow Chinese to get rich.But the tone was set .
Deng and his day-to-day policy-makers wanted to revive the economy and they chose to do so by getting rid of over-bureacratisation and allowing greater autonomy.They started by introducing the responsibility system for farmers , under which China 's 800 million peasants were allowed to sell on the free market any produce they grew over and above the quota for which they were responsible to the state.Agricultural output skyrocketed , farmers ' incomes soared and rural enterprise was born.That success prompted Deng to introduce the factory manager responsibility system that freed managers from the control of the Communist Party secretary ubiquitous in every state unit.Whoever is given responsibility should be given authority as well , Deng said in 1978.He battled orthodox Marxist ideologues to legalise private enterprise.He set up experimental Special Economic Zones on the coast where foreign investment and capitalist practices were allowed to flourish -- and then to seep into the rest of China.He lifted decades of controls on prices of many items , a move that brought bursts of fierce inflation but also allowed the marketplace to take command and meant that goods filled shop shelves that had been left empty by decades of state planning.The ultimate goal was to force enterprises to take responsibility for their own profits and losses and sink or swim amid market competition.Many factories -- some state-owned , many collective and private -- responded to that challenge.However , many government enterprises have been unable to compete , forcing the state to maintain subsidies to lumbering loss-making national industries for fear mass unemployment could trigger civil unrest to destabilise Deng 's fragile new system.About 70 percent of China 's 100,000 state-owned enterprises operate in the red and state banks are burdened with enormous bad debts -- up to 30 percent of their portfolios -- because they must extend policy loans on orders from the government.Deng 's economic policymakers have tinkered with the spectre of bankruptcy but have repeatedly pulled back from the brink of a solution that raises shades of capitalism.The existence of a quasi-private economy alongside the huge and still-dominant public sector has fostered dislocations such as profiteering , corruption and inflation.Introduction of macro-economic controls has been slow amid reluctance to let go entirely of state levers.Deng preferred to set in motion the big picture and to use his unparalleled political clout to push through economic policies rather than to get involved with the policy basics.When he did , he called on occasion for bolder and faster growth -- preferring what he called short-term pain to ensure long-term gain but resulting in sometimes harmful policies that had to be followed by periods of moderation.Deng was a politician , a manager and a generalist whose most successful role was as the political godfather of economic reform , Naughton wrote .
China eulogised Deng Xiaoping on Friday , hailing the diminutive patriarch as a giant whose stature could never be matched and pledging the army 's loyalty to his political heirs.As flags around the capital flew at half-mast on the second day of official mourning for Deng , who died on Wednesday at 92 , the judiciary sounded a cautious note , issuing a nationwide call for stability.Security was discreet and the atmosphere calm in the capital .
People hurried to work as usual on a bright and crisp Friday morning.But hundreds of grieving people gathered in Deng 's birthplace Paifang , a tiny village in southwestern Sichuan , some kneeling on the ground and weeping.Police armed with assault rifles moved in to ensure order , local officials said .
No incidents were reported.Comrade Deng Xiaoping ... became a great son of the people , a giant who will never be matched , the People 's Daily said in a commentary .
The people of the motherland love and esteem him.State radio and television poured out glowing tributes for a second day to the 150 cm ( 5 ft ) communist revolutionary who transformed China from an isolated economic pygmy into a burgeoning behemoth.Communist cells in the military vowed to ensure the world 's biggest armed forces remained loyal to his heir , Jiang Zemin , who holds the jobs of Communist Party chief , state President and head of the three-million-strong armed forces.The party committees of the military say they will continue to lead the armed forces to rally more closely around the Central Committee and the Military Commission with Jiang Zemin at the core , Xinhua news agency said.Analysts said Jiang was determined to ensure a smooth transition , especially in the first days after Deng 's death when opponents will be poised to seize on any policy error.The Supreme People 's Court , China 's top judicial body , ordered all courts to ensure strict law enforcement and to safeguard social stability , Xinhua said.The chief economist for the State Statistical Bureau issued a special announcement that Deng 's passing would not harm the economy , which is shooting up by 10 percent a year.Political transitions in communist China in the past have been fraught with difficulty and the deaths of senior leaders have triggered mass protests more than once.Political analysts said Deng 's passing was unlikely to be marked by unrest.Many predict a power struggle sooner or later , but fought behind the scenes , well away from public scrutiny.After nearly eight years wielding effective power under Deng 's wing , Jiang has built up a powerbase and is seen as the man most likely to lead China 's 1.2 billion people into the 21st century.Most people followed their daily routines despite the loss of the gravelly-voiced socialist reformer who set the world 's most populous nation on the road from revolutionary communism to a capitalist-style market economy.Popular reaction has been subdued , ranging from shock and sadness to indifference.I have no feelings .
Deng was nothing to me , said a 62-year-old snack vendor .
The old go out , the new come in.A few wept .
I felt very bad when I heard the news , said a farmer from Shanxi .
He was a great man.State media was effusive .
The people had vowed to turn their grief into strength to carry on the reforms Deng launched in 1978.Authorities have decreed six days of mourning until the funeral on Tuesday when 10,000 people will gather in the Great Hall of the People.In a letter to the leadership , Deng 's widow and family appealed for a simple farewell for the lifelong Marxist.When he retired in 1989 , Deng himself said : I hope you will see to it that both my retirement and my funeral are simple.Deng wanted his corneas to be donated to an eye bank and his body dissected for medical research .
His ashes were to be scattered at sea , said his widow , two sons and three daughters in their letter.It was a vivid contrast to the treatment accorded Deng 's formidable predecessor , Mao Zedong , when he died 21 years ago .
After a national outpouring of grief , he was embalmed .
His remains are displayed in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.As a complete materialist , Comrade Xiaoping always has a philosophical view of life and death , said the Deng family letter , written four days before he died.China had long been prepared for the departure of its paramount leader .
Deng was last seen in Shanghai in 1994 , a daughter supporting his fragile frame , his chain-smoker 's voice reduced to a hoarse whisper .
China urged the United States Wednesday to grant it permanent Most Favoured Nation trading status , despite doubts in the U.S. Congress that Beijing will keep its promises regarding Hong Kong.Granting China permanent MFN status is good for the healthy development of Sino-U.S. relations , said an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.We will never change our position and attitude to the United States.Chinese hopes of winning over Washington from its annual review on renewal of MFN appeared to fade this week as visiting Congressman Jim Kolbe said China was unlikely to win permanent MFN status this year.I do not believe this year we will grant permanent MFN status to China , the Arizona Republican said Tuesday.U.S .
concerns over whether China will keep its promise to leave Hong Kong untouched after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule this year would slow Beijing 's hopes , he said.We want to monitor Hong Kong for a year before we make any change , Kolbe told reporters in Beijing.President Bill Clinton would have to certify the move in June .
China recovers sovereignty over Hong Kong at midnight on June 30.MFN grants China the same tariff treatment accorded other U.S. trading partners.The U.S. annual review of MFN status is totally wrong , said an official at MOFTEC 's research institute .
It is a product of the Cold War , said the official , who declined to be identified .
Times have changed , but the United States still sticks to this view .
It is unreasonable.China hailed Clinton 's decision in 1995 to delink the annual renewal from China 's human rights record .
Beijing has since been pushing hard for the United States to end the whole annual review process that precedes renewal of MFN status to China and to grant permanent rights.China 's attitude is clear , that these benefits should be granted mutually , the research institute official said .
This is not some kind of special favoured treatment that they gave us .
This is part of normal trade relations so it is not necessary to review it every year , he said.Some U.S. senators have urged Washington to grant China permanent MFN status on grounds the annual review was a disadvantage to the United States and caused uncertainty to business.Beijing and Washington have been trying to mend ties that were badly strained by a series of disputes over the last two years ranging from Taiwan , which China considers a renegade province , to trade and human rights.Last November , Jiang and Clinton agreed on an exchange of presidential visits in 1997 and 1998 , which would be the first since President George Bush came to China in early 1989 .
China has issued a call to crack down on independence activities in the restive region of Tibet by exposing the exiled Dalai Lama as a fake religious leader and pushing ahead with a clean-up of monasteries.The splittist activities of the Dalai Lama clique are not only a major reason in damaging social stability but also are the biggest impediment to the development and reform of our region , the Tibet Daily quoted a senior regional party official as telling a meeting on legal work in the Himalayan region.Regional deputy Communist Party secretary Gui Jinlong told the meeting that officials should step up their work to eliminate the influence of the Dalai Lama in the Buddhist region , the newspaper reported in an edition available in Beijing on Monday.Officials had gained many victories in their crackdown on crime and unrest in Tibet last year , but police needed to strike harder at those in the region who wanted independence , he said.Guo stressed three main tasks for 1997 to ensure stability in the region , which has been rocked by several anti-Chinese riots in recent years.The first was to deepen criticism of the Dalai Lama , he said , referring to the region 's exiled god-king who has won the Nobel Peace Prize for his peaceful campaign for more autonomy for his homeland but who is vilified by Beijing .
( We must ) thoroughly expose his pretence of being a 'religious leader ' so that all the masses and monks and nuns in the region are clear that the Dalai ( Lama ) is a political subversive and a religious sham , Guo was quoted as saying .
( They ) should be clear that the Dalai is a traitor to the motherland , the scum of the people , the chief criminal of religion , and then they will voluntarily oppose splittism and uphold stability , Guo said.China blames pro-independence unrest in Tibet on the Dalai Lama , who is revered by most Tibetans as their spiritual and temporal leader and who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising aginst communist rule.Guo called on legal officials in Tibet to beef up their struggle against infiltration , in a hint that anti-Chinese feelings among Tibetans had spread among officials appointed by Beijing.Thirdly , he called for an intensification of instruction about patriotism in Tibet 's monasteries and temples.He urged legal workers in the region to take part in rectification work and clean-ups of monasteries to raise vigilance in the region against the splittists -- Beijing 's codeword for people it says are trying to divide Tibet from China.Anti-Chinese unrest has erupted sporadically in Tibet since communist troops marched into the region in 1950 , with monks and nuns at the forefront of the pro-independence movement .
China tightened its grip on the media on Sunday with directives on how to write news , ordering journalists not to advocate sex , violence and superstition and to fill their reports with patriotism and socialism.The latest guidelines from China 's propaganda mandarins come amid an ongoing crackdown on ideas that step out of line with party precepts , and which has been billed as a campaign to promote spiritual civilisation , or civic responsibility.Quoting Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin 's Stalinist description of reporters as engineers of the human soul , the All China Journalists ' Association issued a communique to reporters to submit to the supervision of the party and the people.The association set up a hotline for the public to report journalists who break the new rules , in a move reminiscent of the witchhunts of the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and other political campaigns espoused by Chairman Mao Zedong.To ensure China 's reporters were familiar with what they should and should not do , the China News Workers ' Association issued a detailed six-part directive via the official Xinhua news agency.Top of the list was wholeheartedly to serve the people.To achieve this goal , the directive urged reporters to fulfil their supervisory role by bravely criticising and exposing erroneous words and actions and corrupt phenomena that harm the people 's interests.Party chief and state president Jiang has personally mounted a drive to stamp out corruption , a plague he has warned could topple the party , and has used propaganda to back his cause.However , the new directive also specifies events from which reporters should steer clear and the tone in which they should cover topics that are acceptable.Urging reporters to uphold a correct tone in public opinion , it tells them to promote patriotism , collectivism and socialism.News reports must not advocate sex , murder , violence , ignorance and superstition and other bad taste content that harm the spiritual health of the people , it said.This was essential for political stability as well as the happiness of the masses , it said.The directive also called on reporters to respect the constitution and the law , telling them not to publish reports that determine the nature of a case or a crime before the courts have delivered their verdict.China has long used the state-controlled press to publicise crimes or criminals it wants to hold up as examples with little regard to whether sentence has been passed.Neither will reporters be allowed to use the media to spread propaganda that differs from party decisions , the directive said , in a rare signal that some more independent-minded newspapers may be straying from the party line.Reporters must also strictly protect the secrets of the party and the state , uphold the truth in news and not use the media for their own personal ends , it said .
It gave no hint as to how reporters should reconcile the possibly differing demands of the truth and the party.Last week , China 's propaganda tsars ordered journalists to stop violating socialist ethics by asking for money , gifts , credit cards or houses in return for positive reporting , and banned warned them against insider trading.Reporters must voluntarily oppose worship of money , hedonism and individualism , the directive said.China 's communist rulers keep a tight grip on the media , which they view as a propaganda tool that must serve party interests .
Propaganda officials have called on journalists to back party policies and give priority to positive reporting .
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has refused a request from his predecessor , disgraced Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang , to attend the funeral of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping , a Chinese source said on Sunday.Jiang gave Zhao no reason for barring him from attending the memorial rites for the man who personally appointed both men to China 's top job , the source told Reuters.Deng , who handpicked Zhao as his successor in 1987 only to sack him two years later for sympathising with student demonstrators gathered in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square , died in the capital on Wednesday aged 92 .
His memorial rites will be held in the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday.Zhao was in the scenic city of Hangzhou in eastern China where he had gone to spend the Chinese lunar New Year earlier this month , said the source who is close to Zhao.Zhao had sent a request to Jiang and other top leaders the day after Deng died , asking for permission to return to the capital after learning of Deng 's demise , the source said .
Zhao lives under virtual house arrest in Beijing and can move around China only with the approval of the top leadership.Jiang rejected Zhao 's request even though Deng 's family and some party veterans had agreed to allow him to attend the funeral , the source said .
Deng 's family could not be reached for comment.Not only will the leadership not let him attend the funeral , they also will not let him return to Beijing , said the source who asked not to be identified.Zhao renewed his request on February 21 , but the leadership had yet to respond , the source said.Surveillance of Zhao was expected to tighten in the run-up to a crucial party congress later this year as Jiang , who has held the post of party chief since Zhao was sacked , tries to consolidate his power , the source said.Zhao has not been seen in public since May 19 , 1989 when he visited students occupying Tiananmen Square and , with tears in his eyes , beseeched their leaders to call off their pro-democracy demonstrations .
The next day hardliners clamped martial law on the capital.On June 3 and 4 , troops firing automatic weapons and backed by tanks stormed the city centre , retaking the square and crushing the demonstrations with heavy loss of life.Zhao was accused by his enemies of backing the counter-revolutionary turmoil and trying to split the party.Diplomats say China 's current leadership remains nervous of the influence of Zhao , whose relatively liberal political and economic policies made him popular while in office.Party mandarins fear Zhao could be a wild card if he were to re-emerge from his virtual house arrest in a post-Deng power struggle , diplomats said.Zhao has refused to acknowledge making mistakes , giving him some clout among Chinese who disagree with the verdict of hardliners that the 1989 protests were seditious , diplomats said.The source said 77-year-old Zhao was in good health .
He spends much of his time reading books and indulges his passion for golf about once a week .
China 's four oldest Special Economic Zones grew almost twice as fast as the rest of China last year , although foreign investment slowed in a sign their economies remained structurally weak , officials said on Monday.Officials of the State Council 's Special Economic Zones ( SEZ ) Office attributed the slowdown in foreign investment in the coastal boomtowns partly to a government push to attract funds to underdeveloped western and central regions.The zones had shifted their policy towards attracting larger and more high-technology investment and were trying to move away from their previous focus on smaller , more labour intensive projects , one official said in a telephone interview.The economies of China 's zones in Shenzhen , which borders Hong Kong , in Zhuhai and Shantou in southern Guangdong province and in Xiamen in eastern Fujian province posted average gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth of 15.16 percent in 1996 , the China Business Times said.That compared with 9.7 percent nationwide.Their total GDP was 177.5 billion yuan ( $ 21.3 billion ) , it said .
The GDP of Shenzhen alone was 95 billion yuan , accounting for more than half the total , while growth in the boomtown across the border from Hong Kong was 16.4 percent.Fastest growing of the four was Xiamen , which posted a sizzling 19.25 percent , while the slowest was Zhuhai with growth of 8.9 percent.The special economic zones , a brainchild of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and set up in the early 1980s to open China 's doors to the West , had suffered because the technological level of their industry was not high , the official of the SEZ office said.Of the projects they are able to attract , high-technology ones account for a low proportion , he said .
Most are still labour-intensive processing projects.The average industrial output growth of the four was 17.49 percent in 1996 , with total output value of 218.9 billion yuan .
Shenzhen 's industrial output was valued at 120.9 billion , with Xiamen in second place followed by Zhuhai and Shantou.Fastest growth of 30.27 percent was registered by Xiamen , a target for investment from Taiwan .
Shantou was in last place , growing by 9.4 percent.In foreign trade , the total trade of the four zones was $ 55.739 billion , showing a 12.06 percent increase from 1995.Shenzhen accounted for more than half of the total , but showed the slowest growth rate of just 0.7 percent .
Zhuhai recorded the smallest amount of trade at $ 4.949 billion but the fastest growth of 30.17 percent.However , foreign investment showed negative growth in the four zones -- both new contracts signed and investment amount.The SEZ official attributed the slowdown to a better understanding of China among foreign investors , which meant that while the contracts were fewer in number , they were more likely to result in actual inflows of investment.More contracts that are signed actually go ahead , he said.Contracts signed totalled 2,129 in 1996 , or 21.93 percent negative growth , while their value was $ 5.948 billion , or 21.59 percent negative growth.Shenzhen showed the sharpest drop , with the number of new contracts falling 38.8 percent and value slashed 51.5 percent.However , actual foreign investment rose in all four zones with Shenzhen showing the biggest growth of 56.6 percent and Xiamen the smallest at 2.16 percent .
( $ 1.0=8.3 yuan ) -- Beijing newsroom ( 8610 ) 65321921 Britain 's Racal Electronics took the spotlight off a predicted slump in profits on Tuesday by announcing an alliance with its rival ITT Defence team in the race to win a two billion pound ( $ 3.4 billion ) defence contract.Racal chief executive , David Elsbury , said the alliance with the U.S. consortium could yield joint savings of 100 million pounds in development costs for the British Armed Forces Bowman communications contract , due to be decided on by March 1997.The contract is crucial to Racal 's future earnings and those of its existing partner , Siemens of Germany .
The winner of Bowman will get an estimated two billion pounds in follow-through export orders on top of the two billion contract value .
It would create 6,500 new jobs , said Elsbury.But Racal 's chief warned of tough implications if the contract is lost .
To win Bowman would be the prize .
To lose Bowman , God forbid , we would still have a sizeable export market , but we would have to downsize the company.He said the move by Racal and partner Siemens to link up with their U.S. rival followed news from the British government of further delays to the award process.Both sides ' bids were in danger of running to 100 million apiece on research and developments costs , said Elsbury .
Racal 's costs to date are running at between 30 and 50 million , he said.ITT Defence said in a statement that Racal and partner Siemens , who form the Yeomans consortium , had agreed to link with its own CrossBow group on technical , production and manufacturing resources for Bowman.Racal said if they won the order , the companies would form a joint venture and each take a equity stake .
Elsbury refused to comment on how the work would be split , but said We 're happy with the arrangements.The alliance news helped arrest Monday 's 18 percent freefall in Racal 's share price when the group issued an eleventh-hour profit warning , which triggered angry responses from shareholders , ahead of Tuesday 's half-year results.Shares were up five and a half pence at 230 1/2 by 1200 GMT after closing 50 pence lower at 225 on Monday.As forecast , results for the half year to October 11 showed pre-tax profits down to 21.2 million from 30.1 million .
Profits were 20 million lower than was expected this summer and were hit by a 10 million charge relating to the Data products unit.The half year payout was held at 2.10 pence and sales rose to 602 million from 502 million.Full year profits are now seen at 50 million pounds after 20 million of charges .
The results fiasco was blamed by Elsbury on last minute delays in foreign government defence orders , hitting the company 's revenue targets.News of the order slippage was only uncovered as late as last Friday .
The defence orders were earmarked for the radio division which provides defence related equipment to foreign governments.The radio division is undergoing a strategic review which is scheduled for completion by March .
Other divisions , including network services , had shown strong profit growth .
The recently acquired British Rail Telecoms business was described as a superb performer.Data Products is on the verge of a turnaround .
In the second half we should see a profit .
We have n't seen that for many years , said Elsbury .
( $ 1=.5936 Pound ) Britain 's double-decker bus could be at the cutting edge of an environmental breakthrough.For the past two years a London bus operator has carried out experiments with an Arab inventor who says he has the solution to the black diesel-based pollution fumes that led Britain 's air quality levels to break world safety standards last summer.Hassan Assali linked up with the London and Liverpool bus company Merseyside Transport Ltd ( MTL ) in a two-year experiment to test his invention -- an oil recycler which he told Reuters cuts pollution levels by 50 percent and saves on lubricating oil by recycling it six to 10 times.Last summer there was big talk about stopping vehicles entering towns altogether as pollution levels were going through the roof.With this , said Assali cradling his recycler at his West London headquarters , we can cut the amount of oil used and dumped , cut pollution levels , plus save money.The recycler , invented by Assali who is managing director of the company behind it called Pinmore , has taken six years to develop and millions of pounds ( dollars ) of investment funded by an anonymous Palestinian backer.The Pinmore recycler prototype was made by a gunsmith in London 's East End because : It was the only way we could get the precision we needed , said Assali.MADE IN CHINAIt is now being manufactured in China 's Huzhan province and has sold 6,000 units at a cost of 250 pounds ( $ 425.2 ) each.Customers to date include an Algerian bus company which has ordered 3,000 recyclers and Saudi Arabia 's frontier guards who bought 1,000 for their trucks -- They 're constantly plagued by desert sand getting into the oil , added the inventor.In November Assali held a conference in Oxford , England attended by more than 40 delegates from the transport industry , including bus companies.At the conference MTL publicly endorsed the recycler after two years of tests on its oldest London buses .
Professor Gordon Andrews of the fuel and energy department at Leeds University and a consultant to the motor industry , also agreed it worked.Phil Locke , systems manager for group engineering at MTL , told Reuters : We 've had a lot of success and it 's given us tremendous savings .
It 's also given us smaller fuel emmissions , which are down sharply.He said the bus group 's initial scepticism had vanished and it is now considering buying up to 2,000 recyclers for its fleet in London and Liverpool.We 've had so many people approach us in the past with different systems and they say it works .
But most do n't .
We took a gamble on Mr Assali and it 's working , said Locke.I think it 's been looked at by enough people and they see the benefits -- it has the chance of turning into a big thing.The reception from motor manufacturers like Nissan has been cooler , says Assali , despite the pressing environmental and health arguments to cut pollution.Assali also says two major oil companies have called him to rubbish his work out of hand .
I was afraid they would send a hit-man , he joked.But he says the evidence is in his favour .
Pinmore carried out experiments for two years in north London with MTL.RECYCLING BUSThe experiment fitted one bus with a recycler and one without , said Assali .
We said to the client Run these buses in the worst conditions possible - stopping , starting continuously and braking suddenly'.He claimed the old red Routemaster bus , the famous London symbol also renowned for belching black fumes , was fitted with the recycler in February 1995 and did not have to change its oil until July that year.The London arm of MTL then invited Assali to its headquarters in Liverpool where I explained the invention to the top brass.Commenting on the financial benefits , he says that MTL as a company uses 40 tonnes of oil a year -- which can easily be cut by a sixth on average by using the recycler.We started with three principles in mind -- to save oil , maintain engine quality and to help the environment by cutting polluting emissions.The Pinmore filters the oil using a secondary filter controlled by a microprocessor.The filter has a pyramid of discs , down which oil cascades .
Discs are heated to 160 degrees , bringing oil to 120 degrees , hotter than the engine temperature .
As oil trickles down the discs the contaminants , such as water , diesel fuel and gases evaporate.The resulting vapour is fed into a chamber where it is burned off separately.Very old vehicles like the red Routemaster buses , some of which are 25 years old , can run for 60,000 kilometres ( 37,280 miles ) without changing the oil -- that is six times the normal distance.FIRST BUSES , THEN THE WORLDPinmore has high hopes for its product and plans to take polluting vehicles by storm .
We will hit the bus companies first and then the black cab market in London -- 23,000 cabs in total.We will then tackle the major UK cities -- Sheffield , Glasgow , Bradford .
The market is massive .
We could take it to Paris , Frankfurt , Berlin -- every diesel city in Europe.MTL now plans to set up a mobile laboratory where anyone can inspect the recycler and the test results.We 're working towards helping others fight pollution .
We 're not trying to keep it to ourselves , said Locke.If we put it into the bus market first , then perhaps someone from the government will say If it works for buses then why ca n't it work for taxis or the private car ? ' .
( $ 1=.5880 Pound ) Racal Electronics Plc , the defence to communications group hit by a profit warning on Monday which flagged poor interim results on Tuesday , has blamed last minute delays in foreign government defence orders hitting its revenue targets.David Elsbury , chief executive , told Reuters , that news of the order slippage was only uncovered as late as last Friday .
The defence orders were earmarked for the radio division which provides defence related equipment to foreign governments .
After meeting with advisers over the weekend , the group decided to revise its profit outlook down .
He cited the example of one South American government forced to put back its order after being hit by changes in copper prices.The division is already undergoing a strategic review which is expected to report back in March.Elsbury stressed that although orders have been pushed back to next year , none have been lost.He said other divisions , including network services , had shown strong profit growth , citing the recently acquired British Rail Telecoms business as a superb performer.Data Products is on the verge of a turnaround .
In the second half we should see a profit .
We have n't seen that for many years , said Elsbury. -- London newsroom +44 171 5427717 Shares in British conglomerate BTR rose on Wednesday after it clinched a better-than-expected sale price for its Tilcon unit , though profit fears and strategic concerns remained to dampen sentiment , analysts said.BTR sold its U.S. based building materials business Tilcon to Ireland 's CRH Plc for 212 million pounds ( $ 332.2 million ) , better than the 180 million anticipated by the market.BTR 's shares edged five and a half pence higher to 261 , but analysts still expect a cut in dividend and profits when the group announces its interim results next Thursday.Andrew Darke , analyst at Williams de Broe , said The majority of analysts are expecting a cut in the dividend of one third and falling profits.He added that the market welcomed the latest in a stream of disposals , which has raised 700 million pounds in 1996 excluding provisions , saying that this should improve the group 's strained cash flow position.Ian Strachan , BTR chief executive , said on Wednesday that the Tilcon sale proceeds would be invested in our key industrial and engineering operations.BTR is in the throes of a major strategic review which aims to shake-out 20 percent of existing non-core businesses leaving it to focus on the areas listed by Strachan.The issue of cash flow , which ABN Amro Hoare Govett says has turned from an 89 million pounds inflow in 1994 to a 253 million outflow last year , remains a key concern.Analysts also want to know how the group is going to fund its expansion in core businesses like automotive parts and packaging.The market sees the dividend as an obvious tradeoff in BTR 's spending plans .
It would be big news if they did n't cut the dividend , said Darke.Future strategy on how BTR will expand its chosen core areas in industrial manufacturing and engineering is another unanswered question.There is a myriad of unanswered issues , said one analyst .
Strategy , dividend policy , restrcuturing .
There is still quite a major information vacuum waiting to be filled , he said.Despite the uncertainy , many of these concerns have been priced in following a heated debate in the summer which led to a shareprice meltdown.BTR shares hit a low for the year of around 225 pence compared with the annual high of 344 pence before the concerns set in .
( $ 1=.6382 Pound ) AMEC Plc , the British building and engineering group , saw first half pretax profits double on Thursday and pledged to reward investors with final dividend growth in the second half after freezing the latest payout.Pretax profits for the six months to June 30 rocketed to 12.1 million pounds ( $ 18.96 million ) from 6.1 million .
Sales were 1.32 billion versus 1.13 billion.AMEC chief executive Peter Mason told Reuters We would hope to improve the dividend at the year end , after freezing the interim payout at 1.5 pence per share.Mason explained the reason for the conservative payout : On balance we felt it was better to have a dividend which was covered rather than try for a small increase .
But we will deal with it properly at the year end.The chief was confident that profits would be better than last year after announcing in the results statement that turnover should hit the targeted 2.75 billion pounds.AMEC 's shares were up 2 1/2 pence higher at 98 at 1104 GMT.The AMEC chief also told Reuters that as part of his strategic review , kicked off seven months ago , he aimed to boost the group 's international sales through acquisitions and partnerships.Mason has targeted raising overseas sales to 50 percent of total turnover from the current 30 percent in the long term.All options are open , he said , adding that the preferred route for expansion is through partnerships and small acquisitions.I see no merit in acquisitions in basic building and civil engineering businesses , but I want companies offering value-added technology and design , he said .
Several deals are already under discussion.AMEC , which fought off a hostile takeover from Norway 's Kvaerner which still holds 26 percent of its shares , had said earlier this year that a number of companies in South East Asia were interested in buying up this stake in bits to cement business links.This move was seen as a route to expanding sales in the region.Turning to the interim 's divisional results - mechanical and electrical sales rose 20 percent.Building and civil engineering sales rose 28 percent , despite severe problems in the West German market hit by low infrastructure spending and sluggish conditions.As a result AMEC is seeking to transfer some of its resources to the brisker East German market.Process and energy returned to profit in 1996 , but Mason predicts stronger figures in 1997 once the rationalisation benefits kick in .
Housing sales were up 11 percent .
( $ 1=.6382 Pound ) Four and a half thousand workers at U.S. car giant Ford Motor 's Halewood plant in England face judgement day on Thursday when the management will meet unions to discuss the future amid rumours of job losses and closure.Ford said last year it planned to take draconian action to end heavy losses in Europe and British newspaper reports claimed that Ford had now threatened to close the Halewood plant in northwest England.However , last Sunday Ford said in Detroit , the U.S. , that it would restructure but not close Halewood , with some job losses expected and a Ford UK spokesman said on Wednesday that reports of closure were speculative.A report in Britain 's Observer newspaper claimed that Ford planned to tell unions unless they agreed to more efficient working practices and 500 job losses the entire plant faced possible closure.Ford UK 's spokesman told Reuters the meeting with unions led by the Transport and General Workers Union ( TGWU ) is due on Thursday morning.A number of issues are on the agenda .
Reports of plant closure and restructuring are all speculative , he said.The spokesman added the meeting followed an internal review of all UK operations including the sister plant in Dagenham , London.TGWU head of communications , Andrew Murray , said it all hinged on the future of Ford 's Escort model , adding that a statement was expected after the meeting.The next Escort version is due in 1999 and will be the first car engineered under Ford 's new global product development structure called Ford 2000Analysts said it was unlikely that Ford would take the drastic measure of closing down a plant and axing all 5,000 jobs.But Halewood is seen by some to be one of the least productive Ford plants in Europe.Arthur Maher , head of European forecasting at LMC International , said Ford 2000 is about taking cost out of the organisation and reducing the number of ( assembly ) platforms.Europe is a big black hole for Ford in terms of money it 's losing .
It has too much capacity and the costs are above the levels they should be .
Maybe Ford wants to try and extract further productivity improvements in return for some job security .
I think that 's where they are really coming from.He said a plant closure in the UK would be a big political decision in the run-up to an election in Britain ( due by May 1997 ) .
Japanese car giant Nissan Motor Co geared up to expand European sales on Tuesday by announcing a new 215 million pound ( $ 357 million ) investment in its plant at Sunderland in north east England to build a new model.The move will create 800 jobs at Nissan UK and is expected to create a further 2,700 jobs in British supplier firms.The news came just days after U.S. rival Ford Motor Co said it was axing 1,300 jobs at its Halewood plant in Liverpool , north west England because of over-capacity in the world market and to stem painful losses in Europe.In stark contrast , Nissan will create the extra jobs at the north east England plant by adding a third model to the production line at Nissan Motor ( UK ) Ltd ( NMUK ) .
The investment will be for production equipment such as moulds for the car.Japan 's second-biggest carmaker said that from the year 2000 it will produce an extra 100,000 cars a year in the mid-price Pulsar range , called the Almera , in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.The decision to build a third model in Europe was the subject of an internal review at Nissan for some time .
The review was led by European vice-president and head of UK operations Ian Gibson who worked his way up from the factory floor.Gibson , chief executive of Nissan UK , told Reuters in an interview that the UK plant had beaten off internal competition to build the model in Japan by proving Sunderland could produce the model to the same quality , and with similar efficiency and productivity levels as the plant in Japan.It is a considerable vote of confidence ( for Sunderland ) , he said in a BBC television interview .It 's a successful plant and it has an extremely successful workforce and they have won the business , he added.British Trade and Industry minister Ian Lang welcomed the move , saying , This latest decision by Nissan marks a significant development in their presence in Europe and underlines the attractions of the UK as a place to manufacture.Explaining the logic behind the decision , which is in sharp contrast to Ford 's job cuts , Arthur Maher , analyst at LMC International , said : There are two factors which are driving this decision for Nissan .
One is economic and the other is political , he said.First , in the past Nissan has been hit by a high yen ( since declined ) -- a factor which they took seriously .
They probably believed that it would remain a firm currency .
The UK was also a cheap place to build cars for Europe , offering good productivity , he added.Second , politically .
For a long time Japan has been held back from restrictive markets like Italy and France which have tight import quotas , Maher said.He concluded that if Nissan wanted to break into these markets after 2000 , when all export limits on Japanese car imports into Europe are lifted , it made sense to build locally to make the car more acceptable to European customers.The British plant is a springboard into that potential market .
Nissan has three percent of the European market.The potential for Nissan to expand its market share is seen as greater than for the more dominant Ford which has seen sluggish sales in the region.John Lawson , analyst at Salomon Brothers , said he believed that Nissan also had cheaper production costs than Ford in Britain because its salaries are 10 to 15 percent lower.Also despite the rise in the value of the pound , there is still a lot to be said for the decision to manufacture in the UK .
Japan has much higher labour costs and then there is the shipping and tariff costs , said Lawson.The Nissan Europe technology centre in Britain will be responsible for development of the new car .
The decision follows recent Nissan announcements that it will start building diesel engines in Sunderland in 1997 , and will launch an estate version of the Primera built in Sunderland in 1998 , creating 150 jobs .
( $ 1=.6021 Pound ) Britain 's building sector has finally shaken off one of its nastiest ailments , with strong evidence that the long and painful decline in the domestic housing market is now over and sales are on the up again.But celebrations failed to break out across the sector.Housebuilders may be set to reap the rewards of the recovery , but some of the biggest companies in the building industry on Friday continued to suffer from other afflictions.Building material giants like RMC Plc , Redland Plc and BPB saw their shares slide heavily on Friday due to continued problems in the key German market plus the pound 's relentless rise against the mark and dollar which is eating into valuable export revenues.RMC ended 36p lower at 903.5 .
Redland closed 5.5p weaker at 330 , BPB 13p off 362.5p and Blue Circle 7.5p off at 368.Optimistic reports of British housing starts at a seven-year high and earlier predictions of 1997 house price inflation of up to 10 percent were overshadowed by concerns about a continued deterioration in German GDP and higher unemployment.For these big building materials firms , analysts say the impact of Germany -- accounting for up to 40 percent of profits -- far outweighs the small upside from the British house sector.The second negative is the 10 percent appreciation in the pound against the mark over the last few months .
Companies like Redland have already fired a warning signal on sterling 's potential impact on profits.UBS building analyst Simon Brown summed up the gloom : Only a tiny proportion of the building material sector 's business is in the UK .
As a total of construction output , UK housing was 14 percent in 1995.Looking at one of the biggest players in the sector , RMC , Brown said : Less than 20 percent of RMC 's profit comes from the UK and an even smaller part from UK housing .
So it is a tiny proportion of overall earnings.Downgrades have haunted companies exposed to Germany and the pound .
But one player which has escaped the pessimism and is tipped as a buy in light of the housing recovery is Caradon.Caradon is seen as the recovery stock , having slashed around 75 million pounds ( $ 126 million ) from costs in the last two years and rationalised its portfolio of businesses.Its profits are seen rising sharply this year and next .
It has sizeable exposure to the British housing market , through its double glazing window and shower product range .
It can also cash in on demand for building material supplies from Britain.It has the highest proportion of output linked to UK housing , said UBS ' analyst Brown .
Hepworth and Marley could also be worth a play , he said.Howard Seymour , an analyst at brokers BZW , said in a note that he recommended buying Tarmac and Redland -- but that building material firm BPB was classed a sell.We argue that the sector is displaying late cycle characteristics as speculative supply is following demand which gives a robust profile to recovery over 1997.He said that expected rises in British interest rates this year would take a back seat to profit recovery .
Accordingly , investors should view the UK as their first choice for building materials investment over the next 12 months.The main beneficiaries of the house market rebound will be housebuilder specialists .
Those which were best at buying land will be the most serious winners - Berkeley , Persimmon , Barratt and Beazer , said Brown .
( $ 1=.5950 Pound ) U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it would cut 1,300 jobs at its Halewood plant near Liverpool , northwest England , or almost one third of the workforce , through a redundancy programme.Ford 's British operations said that the Halewood plant would not build the planned new model of the Escort car , due in 1999.Production of the new model is likely to transfer to continental European factories in Spain and Germany.However , Ford held out the possibility of Halewood becoming the European source of a planned new vehicle , which is still only a concept at this stage .
It added that Halewood would continue to make the current Escort model through 2000.The actions we have announced today at Halewood assembly operations give the plant a realistic future , with an exciting new vehicle in the medium term , subject to approval and performance objectives being achieved , said David Gorman , European vehicle operations manager for Ford.We have had to take these steps to ensure our manned capacity is in line with our forecasts for sales , he said.Local Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament David Alton told Reuters he had spoken to Ford , which said the jobs would be lost through voluntary redundancy .
He said Halewood was in the running to be the European manufacturing site for a new vehicle , possibly in the family saloon range.There 's some good news in what they say as well -- that they 're looking at Halewood as the probable European site for a planned new vehicle , Alton said.The proposed job cuts will reduce Halewood 's workforce to just over 3,000 , compared with a peak of 14,000 in the 1960s.Management met trade union representatives on Thursday morning to discuss the cuts.Workers expressed anger as they entered the factory , blaming flexible British labour laws and its opt-out from the European Union 's Social Chapter , which sets out minimum working conditions in other EU countries.I can give you one reason why the job cuts are here .
The Social Chapter , said production line group leader Phil Gornall.In Germany , if Ford closes its plant there , it has to pay its people 18 months pay in compensation .
In the U.K. , we 've got no Social Chapter , it 's easier to shut us down , he said.Larry Brook of the MSF union added : Britain is the cheapest place to dump labour .
We are fighting for the future of Halewood.Even if a new family saloon is built at Halewood from the late 1990s , the plant would still have excess capacity , car industry experts said.Production of the new Escort is now likely to be undertaken in Ford 's plants in Valencia , Spain , and Saarlouis , Germany.Professor Garyl Rhys , a car industry expert at Cardiff University , said Halewood , now a model of industrial relations , was paying for the bad old days of the 1960s and 1970s , when the British car industry had a bad strike record.Because of the problems at Halewood and a number of other car plants in Britain , there was a reluctance to use them as sources for exports ... You could n't guarantee deliveries because of interruptions to production because of strikes , he said.As a result , Halewood produced mostly for the home market.The Liverpool area has a higher than average jobless rate and one in three people is unemployed on some of the housing estates near the plant .
Union leaders pledged to fight the cuts .
The United States and Britain ended their latest round of open skies talks Friday , agreeing on some technical issues but failing to reach a full-blown deal to open up the trans-Atlantic air travel market.No new date was set for more talks , although industry sources believed the next discussions could be in in weeks rather than months.Just minutes after the negotiations ended Britain 's Department of Trade and Industry announced that it would block the proposed British Airways alliance with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines on trans-Atlantic routes unless certain conditions were met.Airline industry figures earlier had said the open skies negotiations would remain deadlocked until there was a British verdict on the proposed alliance.Conditions on allowing the alliance to proceed were outlined by Britain 's Office of Fair Trading.However , even if both parties comply with those conditions , the Department of Trade and Industry said the alliance was still dependant on the clinching of an open skies agreement.The U.S. Transportation Department said it was disappointed with the lack of progress.The U.S. side was disappointed with the lack of progress that was achieved in this round of talks and in light of this result we will consider what steps should be taken next , the department said in a statement.Reporting on the open sky talks , a British Department of Transport official said useful progress was made on a number of issues , but not all .
No date has been set for further talks.The meeting included representatives from the transport departments of the British and U.S. governments , as well as major airlines from both sides of the Atlantic.It was understood to be friendly , with no question of a breakdown in communications this time , said one insider.The issues agreed upon in the meeting were peripheral technical matters pertaining to computer reservation systems and ground baggage handling , which are two components within a wider list under discussion for an open skies deal.The wider deal hinges on Britain 's verdict on the British Airways-American alliance , but a rumoured cabinet split led to British Trade and Industry Minister Ian Lang asking the Office of Fair Trading to seek concessions from British Airways and American.Those include asking the two carriers to give up 168 landing slots at London 's Heathrow airport per week.The two airlines have yet to respond.In the past , British Airways had refused to relinquish its slots , stating that other carriers have a bigger share of slots at their home hubs and should find access at Heathrow through trading and normal allocation procedures.The last open skies talks , in August , broke down amid complaints by U.S. carriers that Heathrow is so crowded that open access would be meaningless unless they were to be granted more slots .
Cascade Communications Corp said its core frame-relay business continued to grow in 1996 at the hyper-growth rates seen in recent years , but that some of the evidence of this was concealed in its other businesses.In a phone interview , chief executive Daniel Smith said some frame-relay business is now concealed in sales of Asynchronous Transfer Mode ( ATM ) products , a newer line of high-speed data transmission products Cascade sells.Smith also said he sees Cascade gaining frame-relay market share in 1997 , but at perhaps a slower pace than to date .
We grew market share significantly in 1996 and we expect to continue that in 1997 , but maybe at a slower rate than in 1996 , he told Reuters .
He declined to quantify these growth goals saying it was company policy not to make such forecasts.He said Cascade had relatively flat sequential frame relay sales in the fourth quarter , compared with its September quarter , but attributed this to delays in telecom customer orders , not lost business .
Cascade stock fell sharply Friday following the release of its fourth quarter earnings late Thursday , which were slightly better-than-expected .
By late afternoon Friday , Cascade stock had fallen 23-1/8 to 41 on volume of nearly 39 million shares.Fourth quarter net income was $ 0.24 per share , a penny ahead of consensus , versus $ 0.10 in the 1995 fourth quarter .
Shares of network stocks fell on Thursday amid fears that 3Com Corp 's merger with U.S. Robotics Corp would heap new burdens on an industry already struggling with a raft of near-term issues.Analysts said the $ 7.3 billion merger plan boosted pressure on other network players to use their discounted shares as currency to fund major acquisitions of their own.Some said 3Com 's $ 7.3 billion offer for U.S. Robotics stock and options put a low-ball valuation on the modem maker of 20 times 1997 earnings , versus a historic 25 times multiple .
If anything this deal is more of a take-under than a takeover , Salomon analyst Peter Swartz said of the 3Com deal.This deal says the days of the 35 to 40 percent premiums paid in previous networking acquisitions are over , Swartz said , noting many stocks were now trading at historic lows.Both stocks are down 50 percent from their highs , he pointed out.By midafternoon , U.S. Robotics shares were up 1/4 at 61-1/4 , well below the 68-1/4 contemplated by the terms of 3Com 's merger offer .
3Com stock was off 3-1/2 points at 35-1/2 .
Donaldson Lufkin analyst Eric Buck harshly criticized the terms of the deal .
I think U.S. Robotics shareholders are being robbed , he said.In the wake of the deal , industry leader Cisco Systems Inc was down 2-1/8 to 56 , Ascend Communications Inc lost 4-3/8 points to 58 and Cascade Communications Corp was down 2-1/8 to 30-1/2.We believe the competitive landscape of the networking sector is undergoing a fundamental restructuring , J.P. Morgan 's Bill Rabin said in published comments .
Other networking vendors will have to combine or be bought .
Still , Rabin reiterated buy ratings on four stocks in the sector , while maintaining his market perform rating on 3Com .
Swartz also kept his buy rating on 3Com shares , and recommended investors take advantage of price weakness.The main beneficiaries of the 3Com-Robotics deal appeared to be Bay Networks Inc and Shiva Corp -- two stocks that have sat in the doghouse for some time -- based on their potential as acqusition targets , analysts said.Shiva rose 9/16 to 15-13/16 , recovering from its historic low , while Bay added 1/8 to 19-3/8 .
In comments to his sales force , Merrill analyst Joe Bellace said Shiva , among other remote access suppliers , may be a more likely acquisition target over the next two years in light of the 3Com-Robotics deal , market sources said.The merger forces other players in the industry to ante up to play in this bigger game , said Steve Harmon , an independent analyst who publishes the Internet Stock Report.It forces equipment makers to look for end-to-end solutions supplying network products to both businesses and consumers , he said of how the 3Com-Robotics merger would allow the combined company to compete in both markets .
Strong break-up penalties the 3Com-Robotics deal would levy if either party backs out , makes it unlikely another suitor will arise with a sweeter offer , analysts said.Earnings shortfalls , or close calls , fears of slowing industry growth , and cautionary comments from 3Com , Cascade and Shiva have excited fears about the whole sector , Rabin said.In addition , technology changes in the industry and the growing threat of competition from outsiders such as chip makers Intel Corp and Rockwell International Corp have weighed down the prospects for the industry as a whole.Some analysts cited fears that Intel may decide to integrate network adapter cards or modem chips directly into the computer chassis its builds , rendering stand-alone products from many network suppliers a commodity , if not obsolete. ( ( -- E .
Auchard , Wall Street Bureau , 212-859-1736 ) ) Seeking to show its readiness to compete in high-speed networking , Bay Networks Inc on Tuesday unveiled a set of products and strategies aimed at shoring up its reputation as a technology leader and helping it recover from the stumbles of recent years.David House , Bay 's recently hired chairman and chief executive , outlined the company 's new Adaptive Networking strategy for making the plumbing of Internet-based networks easier to upgrade to the higher-speed networks now emerging .
Everybody 's goal is networks that are invisible to the user , House said during a Las Vegas press conference at Networld+Interop , the semiannual trade show of the Internet equipment industry.We want networks that behave like electricity and water , House said , comparing computer networks to other well-developed infrastructures.Adaptive Networks are the products and technologies that will transition us to the Internet-optimized networks of tomorrow , he said .
His appearance came exactly six months after House joined Bay Networks from Intel Corp , where he served as a respected senior executive for more than two decades.Highlighting the company 's new product announcements was a new single , application-specific networking chip capable of carrying up to 1.5 million packets of Internet data a second -- - allowing networks to carry billions of bits of data per second.The company said the new Route Switch Processor ( RSP ) integrates the manageability of routers with the speed of switches -- two traditionally separate product categories .
House said the RSP chip , now running in Bay laboratories , would be offered in new routing switch products due out in 1998.The RSP chip is designed to solve the growing demand for high-speed Internet transmission , while reducing technical bottlenecks that cause congestion on overloaded data networks.House said RSP would serve as the core technology in its main product lines , including local networks used in corporate offices and in products serving telephone and Internet carriers .
He said the chip would allow Bay to cut switch product prices tenfold over time , driving the cost of advanced switching down to $ 500 per connection from $ 5,000 currently.Sounding like the old chip revolution evangelist he is , House described what he said were the semiconductor-driven dynamics of the networking business , which is seeing benefits from both exponential jumps in the power of computer chip technology and commodity-style price cuts .
New York state utility regulators Thursday approved the $ 23 billion Nynex Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp. merger , subject to conditions the regional telephone giants must agree to by the end of March.Consumer groups opposed to the merger that have demanded rate rebates for New York customers blasted the state Public Service Commission 's decision as a sellout.New York became the last state in Nynex 's six-state service region to approve the merger , which still faces hurdles in Washington and New York.The merger of the Baby Bells would create the nation 's largest local phone company serving customers in 12 Northeastern states and Washington.The bedrock requirements of our approval are improved service quality and ensuring that ratepayers see tangible benefits , New York State Public Service Commission Chairman John O'Mara said.He said in an interview that , while there would be no immediate rate reduction , We have attached conditions that we believe will bring rate reduction.The merger is being held up by federal regulators who are reviewing its competitive implications.Bell Atlantic spokesman Eric Rabe said the companies now expected the deal to close after April 22 , the previous target date .
Obviously , things are moving slower than we had hoped , Rabe said.He said the Justice Department had still not indicated when it would act on the deal .
He said the Federal Communications Commission said it would take 30 days after the Justice Department finishes its review before it took action.The companies welcomed the commission 's decision but said in a joint statement they were still assessing the conditions.In addition , state Attorney General Dennis Vacco expressed concern the decision did not go far enough to protect ratepayers and said he was reviewing the deal.After several months of hearings , the three-member panel voted for the merger and the conditions in a 15-minute meeting in Albany , the state capital.The commission said the combined company must not move major operations that were located in New York state before the merger and that its headquarters be in New York , which New York-based Nynex and Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic have agreed to.The regulators focused on improving customer service in New York , where consumer groups have berated Nynex for offering what they call the worst service in the nation.The approval calls on Nynex to accelerate spending to improve customer service , including hiring up to 1,000 new support staff by the end of 1997 in New York state.A Nynex spokesman said the company has been hiring service personnel over the past year and would hire more in 1997 .
Last year , it hired 3,600 employees in service-related areas , three-fourths of them in New York state .
Overall , Nynex has just over 68,000 employees.Consumer groups were swift to criticise the commission 's decision.We are outraged that this commission approved a merger that is completely anticompetitive , said Robert Ceisler of the New York Citizens Utility Board ratepayers ' group .
The commission has sanctioned a more powerful and richer monopoly.Consumer advocates had demanded the commission at least force Nynex to give consumers immediate rebates to compensate for the reduced competition and greater efficiencies expected from the merger.Other conditions cited were having Bell Atlantic pledge to observe existing agreements between regulators and Nynex , that Nynex employee pension funds be protected , and that Bell Atlantic grant regulators access to its records.Nynex stock closed down 37.5 cents at $ 47 while Bell Atlantic fell 75 cents to $ 63.625 , both in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Xerox Corp. on Thursday reported higher fourth-quarter profits from continuing operations , as a 26 percent rise in sales of digital products offset flat sales of its mainstay black and white copiers.Xerox shares also got a boost when the nation 's largest maker of document processing systems said it had agreed to sell part of its Talegen insurance holdings in a deal worth $ 450 million including assumption of debt.In addition , the company also said its board had voted to raise the dividend 10 percent.Xerox reported earnings of $ 426 million for the latest quarter , up 12 percent compared to earnings from continuing operations of $ 379 million in the 1995 quarter.The 1995 figure excludes a $ 1.6 billion charge related to the planned sale of Talegen and a one-time gain on taxes related to operations in Brazil.Sales rose to $ 5.08 billion from $ 4.76 billion.The earnings beat forecasts by a few cents a share , according to figures from First Call , a service that tracks analysts ' estimates , and Xerox stock closed up $ 1.375 at $ 59.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.The fourth quarter report marked a significant turnaround from a stunning third quarter earnings disappointment that had sent Xerox shares tumbling as low as $ 46 a share in October.A lot to like , Smith Barney analyst Peter Enderlin said , pointing in particular to sales growth in key businesses , progress on exiting the insurance business , and the dividend increase .
It was a good solid quarter , he said.Stamford , Conn.-based Xerox said in September that a deal to sell all of Talegen for $ 2.7 billion to investors led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & amp ; Co. , the New York buyout firm , had fallen apart , leaving it to sell the insurance unit piecemeal.Xerox announced Thursday that it agreed to sell Talegen 's Coregis unit , a professional liability insurer , for $ 375 million in cash and the assumption of $ 75 million in debt to General Electric Co. 's GE Capital unit.Xerox said that its digital product revenues , which now account for a third of overall corporate revenues , rose 26 percent in the quarter , boosted by strong sales of color copiers and printers and copy publishing systems.Black-and-white copiers , the products that remain synonymous with the company 's name , accounted for 53 percent of total revenues.Strong increases in copier equipment sales in the United States and Brazil were partly offset by a decline in Europe , due largely to sluggish national economies , the company said.Xerox Chairman Paul Allaire said he was encouraged by the planned sale of Coregis and by the strong interest of prospective buyers in the rest of Talegen Holdings Inc.He said he expected Xerox will have sold most of Talegen 's operations by year-end and hinted the divestiture may allow it to boost its program to buy back shares of Xerox stock , a move that increases the value of remaining shares outstanding.Industry analysts had said Coregis was the most attractive piece of Talegen , which also provides workers ' compensation , industrial indemnity and other types of specialized insurance products.Chicago-based Coregis , which has 470 employees , writes commercial property and casualty insurance for public entities and licensed and certified professionals.Xerox said in a separate deal it agreed to sell Apprise Corp. , a New Jersey-based firm that sells computing services to insurers , to Andersen Consulting .
Terms were not disclosed.Xerox also said the board voted to raise the quarterly dividend to 32 cents a share from 29 cents , an increase of 10 percent , payable April 1 to shareholders of record on March 7.For the full year , Xerox earnings from continuing operations rose 3 percent $ 1.21 billion from $ 1.17 billion , in 1995 .
Including the charge for Talegen , Xerox lost $ 472 million in 1995.Sales grew 5 percent to $ 17.38 billion from $ 16.59 billion .
Computer Associates International Inc shares gave up six percent of their value Wednesday and analysts said the fall reflected concern over an unexpected secular decline in mainframe revenues.While the company had issued cautionary comments in late December that revenues were unlikely to meet expecations due to sales problems in its European operations , analysts said they were caught off guard by the mainframe sales slippage.By midday Wednesday , the stock had fallen three points to 43 .
It was the second most active issue on the NYSE .
In addition , analysts said CA 's decline may be tied to broader weakness in the mainframe business , citing disappointing growth in International Business Machines Corp 's own hardware business during the December quarter.IBM is the world 's dominant supplier of mainframe software , while Computer Associates is a leading independent supplier of software used to run mainframe machines.People got spooked about the mainframe business , said Alex .
Brown analyst Chris Mortenson , who noted the company told analysts in a conference call Tuesday night mainframe revenues had fallen eight percent in the December quarter .
Cowen & amp ; Co analyst Drew Brosseau said mainframe sales were a primary reason why he had lowered his revenue estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter ending in March and for its fiscal 1998 year .
He also tied the stock decline back to IBM.Anything that affects IBM mainframes positively or negatively is going to have an impact on CA , he said , noting how IBM 's mainframe growth is considered a key indicator of the health of the mainframe business overall.The analyst said he trimmmed his March fourth quarter revenue estimate by $ 40 million to $ 1.6 billion and reduced fiscal 1998 revenues by $ 150 million to $ 4.55 billion .
But despite mounting mainframe revenue concerns , most analysts left earnings estimates and stock ratings untouched.Most of that near-term transitional challenge is in the stock so we are still recommending it , Brosseau said .
But I expect the performance to come mostly in the second half of the ( calendar ) year .
He stood by his $ 55 12-month target.Mortensen added that , I find today that most investors are asking , 'What 's going to make the stock go up in the next 30 days ?
' If you do n't have a good answer , they sell it.The stock has fallen back in recent weeks from the historic high of just under 68 it acheived in early December .
Although the company said in October that it was planning to focus its business increasingly on client/server instead of mainframe software , and warned in December of a transitional revenue shortfall , analysts said they were suprised to see an absolute decline in mainframe sales during the latest quarter.In a published note , Furman Selz analyst Sanjiv Hingorani said mainframe revenues fell eight percent to $ 640 million , mostly in Europe .
He said CA had suggested the shortfall in the region amounted to $ 200 million in unrealized revenues.Especially troubling to analysts was a sequential decline in mainframe MIPS among existing customers CA had described .
MIPS , or Millions of Instructions Per Second , is a measure of the capacity of the mainframe systems shipped to customers.In its own commments to analysts Tuesday evening , IBM said MIPS grew 35 percent in the fourth quarter compared with 80 percent in fourth quarter 1995 .
MIPS are the primary indicator of mainframe growth IBM discloses to analysts.Mortenson said Computer Associates executives said they had never encountered such a decline in mainframe capacity .
Under grilling by analysts , they said they believed it to be an anomaly which would disappear in the current quarter.The company , which has historically derived more than 70 percent of its revenues from mainframe sales , said mainframe software accounted for 61 percent of revenues in the December quarter , while client/server software amounted to 39 percent.Computer Associates reported operating earnings of $ 0.75 per share for its fiscal third quarter ended in December versus $ 0.60 per share in the December 1995 quarter .
The latest quarter excluded a $ 598 million acquisition charge .
( ( -- New York newsdesk , 212-859-1736 ) ) ( Corrects by deleting the fourth paragraph , so that the story will reflect that at no point did Giering blame AT & amp ; T for tax issues that NCR faces as an independent company .
) NCR Corp eked out a small profit in the fourth quarter of 1996 and saw healthy gains in year-over-year profit margins but hopes of matching computer industry growth rates remain a long way off , executives said.In a conference call with analysts and a phone interview after the call , NCR Chief Financial Officer John Giering said profits are weighed down by a whopping 75 percent tax rate.Giering said NCR was unlikely to bring its tax levels down to resemble industry norms of 35 to 40 percent before 1999 .
He said his goal was to bring the company 's U.S. operations to breakeven in 1997 in terms of profitablity .
NCR is already profitable in its overseas operations , which accounted for half of its $ 7 billion in 1996 revenues.Besides slashing the company 's tax rate , the NCR executive said the company 's primary goal was to see a 9 to 12 percent growth rate from core operations over the next several years.Giering said he expected NCR to reach gross profit margins in the mid-30 percent range within three years .
In 1996 results released earlier Tuesday , gross margins for the year rose to 28.1 percent from 1995 's 21.8 percent.Giering said profits remain small but tax liabilities are very large , hence the high effective rate .
AT & amp ; T absorbed much of the potential benefit from operating loss carry-forwards when NCR was still a subsidiary , he said.On balance , AT & amp ; T relieved NCR of more than $ 3 billion in net losses since 1993 , leaving NCR 's balance sheet remarkably clean prior to its spin-off as a separate company this month.NCR said it ended 1996 with $ 1.2 billion in cash and debt of only $ 76 billion .
Right now ( the tax rate ) is in the 75 percent range , Giering told Reuters , I look at this as a 1997 phenonmon.He estimated that the tax rate would come down to roughly 50 percent in 1998 on the way to the 35 to 40 percent level expected in 1999 .
Clearly we need to have more income in the U.S. to turn that number around , Giering said.The company may be aided in its goal of balancing the contribution of its U.S. and international operations by trends in top-line revenue growth .
Giering told analysts that the 1996 revenues for core businesses , excluding mass-market PCs and the entry level server businesses it is exiting , grew 9 percent in the Americas , but declined one percent in Europe and 3 percent in the Asia/Pacific region.NCR does not break out its revenues in dollar terms.The CFO said his primary goals was to ensure that international operations are really paying their full share in terms of all the costs incurred on their on behalf .
He said one of the anomalies NCR is working hard to reconcile is that many of its corporate functions are domiciled in the United States , which made sense as a unit of AT & amp ; T but now hurts NCR as a standalone entity at tax-time.Deep concern about NCR 's financial prospects commbined with the company 's insecure position in a computer industry that refuses to stand still has lead Wall Street analysts to be deeply leery of the stock since its public debut.Of the two analysts following the stock , one of them , Smith Barney 's Shao Wang maintains a neutral rating .
In an an unusual move on a neutral rated stock , Wang set a target price of $ 28 on the stock , well below its current price of $ 38-3/4.Nonetheless , on the strength of its ongoing turnaround , its limited fourth quarter profits and rising profit margins , NCR stock gained 3-1/8 on Tuesday. -- E. Auchard , New York newsdesk , 212-859-1736 Shareholders of MCI Communications Corp are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favor of the proposed merger with British Telecommunications Plc at MCI 's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday.The shareholder vote is one of the first major milestones on the road to winning approval for the $ 23 billion cross-border merger , which will create a combined company known as Concert Plc with $ 40.6 billion in revenues .
The merger awaits regulatory approvals in Washington , London and Brussels , the headquarters of the European Commission .
Company officials are confident the merger -- announced in November 1996 -- is on track to close in the fall of 1997.The annual meeting , to be held in out-of-the-way Wilkes Barre , Pa. , two hours north of Philadelphia , is expected to be a quiet affair , with only three items on the agenda : the shareholder vote , and election of directors and auditors.Wilkes Barre was chosen because it was the hometown of William McGowan , the legendary founder and former chairman of MCI , who died in June 1992 .
In his speech to shareholders Wednesday , Bert Roberts , MCI 's current chairman and chief executive , is expected to focus on the projected benefits of its merger , which would create one of the world 's first global communications carriers.One industry analyst briefed by the company said he expected Roberts to reveal some of the early products and services that may result from its ties to British Telecom.Among the possible offerings would be seamless services connecting the United States and Britain , including wireless phone transmission , faxing , electronic mail , voice mail and the Internet , the analyst said .
Industry analysts believe the MCI official will also respond to AT & amp ; T Corp 's initiative to offer local phone service using a fixed wireless system attached to the side of a customer 's premises as a means of bypassing local networks controlled by regional Bell companies.Through interconnection pacts and the new wireless technology , AT & amp ; T has said by 1998 it plans to offer local service to the vast majority of the U.S. population .
MCI made an early move into local phone markets with its MCI Metro unit but has appeared less aggressive than its rivals since the passage of the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 in evolving a strategy to expand its local phone presence.A key benefit of the merger with cash-rich British Telecom is the financing muscle that MCI can tap as it seeks to slice substantial market share away from the incumbent regional Bell companies in various local service markets .
MCI provides local service in 20 U.S. metropolitan markets through a mix of company-owned facilities and resale agreements to use other companies ' networks .
It has said it plans to be in 31 local service markets by the end of 1997.By contrast , long-distance rivals AT & amp ; T and Sprint Corp have each said they are gearing up to compete in the 50 top U.S. metropolitan markets by year-end.There are three nominees , all British , to the MCI board .
They include Sir Peter Bonfield , British Telecom 's chief executive and a current MCI board member ; Sir Colin Marshall , chairman of the Confederation of British Industry and chairman of British Airways ; and J. Keith Oates , deputy chairman of British retail group Marks and Spencer Plc.Sources close to the company said they expected a favorable vote at the meeting , due in part to the substantial 20 percent stake that British Telecom already owns of MCI and the lack of opposition to the merger among other shareholders.The MCI vote will be followed April 15 by an extraordinary general meeting of British Telecom shareholders to be held at Wembley Stadium in London .
Shareholders of MCI Communications Corp. are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposed merger with British Telecommunications Plc at MCI 's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday.The shareholder vote is one of the first major milestones on the road to winning approval for the $ 23 billion trans-Atlantic merger , which would create a combined company known as Concert Plc with $ 40.6 billion in revenues.The merger awaits regulatory approvals in Washington , London and Brussels , the headquarters of the European Union .

U S West Communications Group .
reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings Friday , citing successful marketing programmes and tighter cost controls.The Englewood , Colo.-based telephone operator earned $ 328 million , or 68 cents per share , in the first quarer , up from $ 289 million , or 61 cents , a year earlier.The earnings were several cents ahead of Wall Street expectations , which , according to First Call Inc. , put earnings at 65 cents a share.U S West Communications Group has started off 1997 with double-digit momentum on the heels of 1996 's accelerating results , said Richard McCormick , chairman of U S West Inc. , the holding group for the phone company.U S West Communications serves more than 25 million customers in 14 Western and Midwestern states.U S West officials cautioned analysts against raising their earnings projections for the year , saying investments in new wireless networks and growing competition were likely to dampen earnings growth.The current consensus estimate for the 1997 year has U S West Communications earning $ 2.54 per share vs. $ 2.44 per share in 1996 , according to First Call.Absent a significant regulatory shift , we remain comfortable with the consensus estimate for the 1997 year , Chief Financial Officer Allan Spies told Wall Street analysts.Spies stood by a prediction U S West made at a February analysts ' meeting , projecting overall earnings growth of 4 percent to 6 percent in 1997 .
First-quarter 1997 earnings per share grew 11.5 percent.Revenues rose 5 percent to $ 2.59 billion from $ 2.46 billion.The company said local service revenues grew 7.5 percent to $ 1.23 billion in the quarter , with almost half the growth driven by sales of value-added features beyond basic access.It said Caller ID subscribers rose by an unprecendented 900,000 in the first quarter due to an aggressive promotional campaign .
The product is now used by 26 percent of its residential customers.Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Klugman said the company also benefited from labour cost cuts .
U S West Communications trimmed 4,000 employees in the last four quarters .
It now has a work force of just over 47,000.U S West Communications , among other Baby Bell stocks , rose amid speculation of other combinations after U.S. regulators approved the merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp.It closed up $ 1.875 at $ 33.25 on the New York Stock Exchange .
British Sky Broadcasting Plc emphasised its commitment to digital television on Thursday and warned that the UK was falling behind its European neighbours in the move into the new era.Our clear and unambiguous aim is to be in the vanguard of the digital era , BSkyB deputy managing director David Chance told a Financial Times conference on New Media and Broadcasting.BSkyB , the leading force in British pay television with some 5.5 million subscribers , plans to launch 200-channel digital satellite services into the UK later this year.It has also joined forces with UK commercial television giants Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc to apply for licences to operate digitial terrestrial television ( DTT ) services.Their British Digital Broadcasting consortium faces competition from DTN , owned by Nasdaq-listed cable company International CableTel , for three key DTT licences.Britain 's Independent Television Commission ( ITC ) is expected to announce a decision on the licences around May.DTT , broadcast from land-based transmitters to standard television aerials , is scheduled to begin in mid-1998 and offer a total of around 30 channels.Chance said that he hoped that neither UK nor European regulators would oppose British Digital Broadcasting if it were awarded the DTT licences.Eight years ago we led Europe in multi-channel TV , Chance said .
We are probably the last in Europe to launch a digital platform ... It is n't the time for a handbrake to be applied.We are behind and we need to get on with it.Digital television offers extra channels , improved sound and picture quality and the potential to access interactive services Channel 5 , Britain 's new commercial television station , said on Monday it was delighted with its launch after initial figures showed that five of its first night shows attracted a million viewers or more.An estimated 2.3 million Britons tuned in when the station was launched on Sunday by chart-topping band The Spice Girls.We are delighted by the figures given that the weather was so good and some people are still tuning in their sets to pick us up , said Channel 5 spokeswoman Sally Osman.Initial figures from the BARB monitoring service give Channel 5 a 5.8 percent share of viewing in the 6 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. slot.The channel , the first commercial terrestrial station to launch in Britain since 1982 , has a limited budget and has set itself a target for an audience share of five percent by the end of the year .
It has styled itself modern and mainstream and is focusing particularly on the under-35s.ITV , the dominant commercial television network , hit back by pointing out that its long-running Coronation Street soap had 11.6 million viewers for its Sunday evening episode .
It said it had retained its traditional dominance of the ratings.Channel 5 has transmission problems to overcome and is so far available in only six out of 10 British households.It hopes to boost coverage to around 85 percent of the UK by the end of the year after an extra broadcast frequency comes on stream .
It aims to fill in the gaps through carriage agreements with cable and satellite companies.It was given a guarded welcome by the British press .
Although the station 's news output should be distinctive the mix of soaps , imports , comedy and films is close to what is already on offer elsewhere , the Times wrote in an editorial.But the newspaper said that the channel 's low budget need not result in low quality.There are obvious opportunities for savings in modern programme making .
If that space is creatively exploited by Channel 5 then it should be able to secure for itself a deserved place on the nation 's screens , it added.Channel 5 is owned by British media companies Pearson and United News & amp ; Media , plus European broadcast group CLT-Ufa and U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus.It is the third commercial terrestrial channel after the ITV network and Channel 4 .
The two BBC channels are funded by an annual licence fee levy .
The newcomer also faces competition from some 40 or so cable and satellite channels , to which around 25 percent of British households subscribe.Channel 4 has a remit to cater for minority tastes so Channel 5 will compete directly with ITV for the mainstream terrestrial audience.ITV has an average audience share of around 35 percent and its annual programming budget of 800 million pounds ( $ 1.3 billion ) far outweighs the 110 million pounds which Channel 5 plans to spend .
( $ 1= .6124 Pound ) British leisure group Rank Group Plc said on Thursday that it planned to open a further 36 Hard Rock cafes internationally over the next three years.The expansion programme for the themed diners will be launched in July and cafes will open at the rate of one a month until the year 2000 , the company said.Rank , which last year reunited the Hard Rock brand worldwide , said the outlook for its businesses was promising after a year in which an exceptional charge of 232 million pounds ( $ 375 million ) badly hit profits.Profit before tax in 1996 fell to 65 million pounds from 515 million the year before .
However , the 1995 figure was boosted by a 236 million pound exceptional gain.Rank raised its net dividend by eight percent to 17 pence per share and said operating profit before exceptional items was 13 percent higher at 290 million pounds.The company , which is in the process of a radical restructuring , said that it expected to create 3,000 jobs in Britain this year as it opened new pubs , cinemas , holiday and leisure centres and bingo clubs.The news was welcomed by British National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley , who saw it as a further boost to the nation 's thriving tourist industry.This is excellent news for Britain and underlines the tourism industry 's role as one of our major job creators and wealth generators , she said.Rank shares , which have underperformed the market by 20 percent over the past year , added 19.5p to 434.5p.Share analysts said that the price had been bolstered by Rank 's plans to ask its shareholders for permission to buy back up to 10 percent of the company 's stock.Chief executive Andrew Teare said that Rank was well set after a decision to focus on four divisions -- Hard Rock , Holidays , Leisure and Film and Entertainment Services.These changes , together with the benefits of our investment programme and the generally favourable economic climate , provide a promising outlook for Rank , Teare said.Rank last year won outright control of the Hard Rock brand worldwide when it bought the cafes and brand rights owned by Peter Morton , one of the joint founders of the chain in 1971 .
Ownership of the brand had previously been split.There are plans this year to launch a television series based on the brand and a new Hard Rock Records label has also been announced.Teare said Rank planned to sell its film distribution unit , which has a catalogue of classic British films dating back to the 1950s as well as some more modern American movies.Newspapers have speculated that the sale might raise up to 150 million pounds but Teare indicated he thought some of the figures in the press were on the high side.The exceptional charges related mainly to a 148 million pound property value writedown , plus a loss on disposals and charge for restructuring.Comparisons with last year were further complicated by a change in the way Rank accounts for its remaining 20 percent interest in Rank Xerox , its office equipment joint venture with America 's Xerox Corp.Rank repeated that it planned to sell the stake when a suitable opportunity arises .
However , Teare told analysts that he had not yet discussed the sale with Xerox .
( $ 1=.6184 Pound ) The UK government on Monday threatened to scupper a bid by London Clubs International for rival casino group Capital Corp when they passed it to competition authorities.Consumer Affairs Minister John Taylor said the 190 million pound ( $ 310 million ) hostile bid raised competition concerns in relation to the London casinos market .
He referred it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ( MMC ) .London Clubs , which operates seven casinos in the British capital , said it was disappointed by the decision.We believe that the arguments which we submitted to the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) provided sound evidence that there were no adverse competition issues , said London Clubs chief executive Alan Goodenough.The MMC has until July 7 to decide on the issue .
The referral means the bid automatically lapses.London Clubs said its board would meet to consider future action .
It could come up with a fresh bid if the MMC clears the proposed acquisition of Capital , which operates Crockfords and the Colony Club for high rollers in the swish Mayfair area of London.A merged company would have controlled almost two-thirds of London 's 1.7 billion pound casino market.Shares in Capital Corp fell 15.5p to 184.5p after the bid was scrapped .
They had stood at 171p on February 14 , the day before the bid was tabled .
London Clubs came off 6.5p to 402p , having risen from 385p during the bid process.London Clubs had been offering 47 of its shares for every 100 in Capital Corp in its all-paper offer .
Share analysts had forecast a sweetened offer from London Clubs.Capital Corp chief executive Alan Hearn welcomed the MMC referral , repeating that the bid was too low.The referral enables us to focus on developing further the group 's valuable business , without the distraction and expense of a hostile bid , he said .
I welcome the opportunity to demonstrate to shareholders the significant value we can create as an independent company.Hotel and gaming company Ladbroke Group Plc , which has four London casinos , had been mentioned as a possible rival bidder for Capital Corp .
There had also been speculation that leading British leisure company Rank Group Plc , which has 31 casinos , could enter the fray.British casinos are increasingly attractive investments as the government relaxes rules on membership and drinking hours .
There are also proposals to allow new clubs to open at some 20 sites .
( $ = 0.611 British Pounds ) Leading British television companies BSkyB , Carlton Communications and Granada Group teamed up on Friday to apply to run digital terrestrial TV ( DTT ) services in Britain.The formation of their British Digital Broadcasting venture , appeared to transform the prospects for DTT , previously dismissed as a lame duck technology.British Digital Broadcasting has put in an application to run three DTT licences , offering 15 channels , including subscription channels from the BBC.It faces competition from U.S. owned cable company International CableTel Inc , which has also put in an application for three of the four available networks.The company is Britain 's third largest cable operator and owns NTL , one of two major British transmission companies.The BSkyB/Carlton/Granada/BBC venture plans three premium subscription channels showing top films and sporting action .
Another 12 channels will be offered as part of a basic subscription package.Shares in the three companies surged on Friday as markets welcomed the news .
BSkyB added 21.5p to 602p , Carlton gained 21p to 540.5p and Granada added 12.5p to 890p.DTT will broadcast from land-based transmitters to ordinary rooftop aerials .
However , viewers will need a set-top decoder costing at least 200 pounds ( $ 324 ) to receive the service.There will be six digital networks or multiplexes , each capable of broadcasting at least five channels .
The first two have been earmarked for the existing , free , terrestrial broadcasters , the BBC and the ITV commercial network.The other four will be awarded by the Independent Television Commission ( ITC ) watchdog body .
The service is expected to be on the air by mid-1998.Digital television offers more channels , clearer pictures and the possibility of accessing interactive services such as home shopping and home banking.But DTT , with only 30 channels , had been seen as the poor relation to BSkyB 's planned satellite version which will offer 200 channels.BSkyB , in which Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp is the leading shareholder , is expected to press on with its digital satellite launch in Britain later this year .
DTT is seen as a complementary service.By plugging in one simple set top box , viewers will be able to see all the existing terrestrial channels , new free channels , the latest movies and the best sport , said Carlton chairman Michael Green.Green will chair British Digital Broadcasting , and Carlton , Granada and BSkyB will each own one third of the company which unites Britain 's leading commercial ITV companies with satellite pay operator BSkyB.If successful in winning the three licences , the shareholders have agreed to meet between them a peak funding requirement of up to 300 million pounds .
The company is expected to be profitable within five years .
( $ 1=.6172 Pound ) British newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc said on Thursday its 1996 profit rose six percent to a record level and that it was ploughing savings from lower newsprint costs back into its titles.We are trying to enhance our papers rather than cutting the cover price , chief executive David Montgomery said in a telephone interview.All the main newspaper groups are heavily subsidising cover prices in one way or another at the moment ... We do not think this is the way to build a business , he added.A newspaper price war has been fought in Britain since 1993 , Rupert Murdoch 's News International newspapers leading the way with price cuts and special promotions.Montgomery said that the price of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed -- had fallen some 20 percent from 1996 highs .
The Mirror 's newsprint bill last year came to more than 130 million pounds ( $ 210 million ) .The group 's flagship Mirror newspaper is Britain 's second-top selling tabloid , behind News International 's Sun.Mirror 's 1996 pre-tax profit rose 6.6 percent to 82.2 million pounds , before exceptional items .
Total dividend was increased by 12.5 percent to 4.5p per share.Mirror Group shares came off 5.5p to 211p by 1115 GMT in a generally lower London market.The group is in a good financial position to make prudent investments for the future and to continue its strategy of creating a more broadly based media group , the company said.Mirror Group has interests in cable television and a stake of around 20 percent in Scottish Television Plc , the commercial terrestrial ( ITV ) broadcaster to central Scotland.Losses from the developing Live TV cable channel fell from 10 million to around eight million pounds in 1996.Mirror Group has a 46 percent stake in Newspaper Publishing , the company which produces the Independent and Independent on Sunday broadsheets and Montogomery said there were no plans to dispose of this.The two newspapers reported circulation rises in February , the first signs that they may be pulling out of a sales slump.Newspaper Publishing operating losses were 43 percent lower last year and Montgomery said that cost savings from combined operations meant the impact was negligible to Mirror Group.The group said it had an exceptional gain of 19.4 million pounds in 1996 , generated by the resolution of a number of property-related issues and the sale of STV 's stake in fellow regional broadcaster HTV.An exceptional tax credit of 9.1 million pounds was included in the 1996 accounts after a settlement was reached with the Inland Revenue on corporation tax payable for 1991-1994 .
Profit after tax increased to 83.1 million pounds , from 82.4 million pounds in 1995 .
( $ 1=.6228 Pound ) Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier Plc reported an 11 percent rise in 1996 profit on Wednesday but warned that currencies could depress this year 's earnings.Reed Elsevier co-chairman Nigel Stapleton told Reuters the strength of sterling would , if maintained , drag down headline earnings by five percent this year .
Earnings figures for the combined businesses of Reed Elsevier are expressed in sterling.Pre-tax profits rose to 805 million pounds ( $ 1.3 billion ) from 723 million on turnover from continuing operations up to 3.38 billion pounds from 3.21 billion .
Analysts had forecast profits of between 808 and 821 million pounds.Reed International Plc , the British arm of the business , proposed a two-for-one share split to take effect in May.London-listed Reed shares were down 23.5 pence to 1,150.5p at 1145 GMT , while Elsevier NV shares in Amsterdam dipped 1.70 guilders to 30.80.Analysts said the company 's performance had fallen slightly short of expectations and that Reed shares had risen more than 10 percent over the last two months on bid speculation.For shareholders in Reed the full-year dividend was raised by 11 percent to 27.2 pence per share .
Elsevier shareholders will receive 0.76 guilders per share , a 29 percent increase.The company noted that currency conversions meant that Elsevier results and dividends were helped in guilder terms.It 's good news for Elsevier and bad for Reed , said co-chairman Stapleton .
( But ) the two share prices are linked so much that Elsevier should pull Reed up with it in some respects.Stapleton said the 1996 figures reflected a solid performance right across the group .
They followed a four percent earnings dilution resulting from the company 's 1995 consumer business divestment programme.Reed Elsevier sold consumer businesses , such as local newspapers , in order to focus on the provision of information in fields like science , business and the legal profession.Reed Elsevier said it remained committed to an active acquisitions policy .
He noted the company had spent over 300 million pounds on some 20 transactions in 1996.Stapleton said a big deal such as Reed 's $ 1.5 billion purchase of U.S. on-line information supplier LEXIS-NEXIS in 1994 would be nice but not necessary.Reed said its proposed share split would be put to the vote at its annual general meeting in April , to take effect the following month.It gave no reason for the split , but companies often opt to split their stock in the belief that the process makes their shares more liquid or tradeable .
( $ = 0.629 British Pounds ) Channel 5 , the British terrestrial television channel gearing up for launch next month , is confident of winning a five percent share of UK viewing by the end of the year , chief executive David Elstein said on Tuesday.We 're confident we can deliver five percent of total viewing by Christmas this year , Elstein said as Channel 5 presented its programming schedule.The exisiting ITV commercial network has an audience share of over 35 percent .
However , its annual programme budget of 600 million pounds is much bigger than the 110 million core figure earmarked by Channel 5.Channel 5 's audience will grow as ITV 's declines , said Dawn Airey , Director of Programmes .
She promised intelligent , stylish and popular shows from a channel that is hoping to be a hit with the young consumers sought after by advertisers.Channel 5 is owned by a consortium of British firms Pearson and United News & amp ; Media plus Luxembourg broadcast group CLT and US investment firm Warburg Pincus.It will go on air on Easter Sunday , March 30 , having delayed its launch by three months in order to give it more time to complete the task of retuning the nation 's video recorders.It has employed an army of retuners to visit millions of homes across Britain to prevent its signal from interfering with video playback.Elstein said that Channel 5 should be available to around 40 million people -- just over 65 percent of the population -- at launch in March.But he said this should grow to 45-46 million , or around 85 percent of Britons , by the end of the year as an extra broadcasting frequency comes into operation.However , he conceded that as many as two million of the 18 million households covered may need to buy new aerials or aerial extensions to pick up the signal clearly.Major areas of Britain will not see the new commercial channel , the first to be launched in this country since 1982 .
The Scottish city of Glasgow and parts of Wales and the south-west will miss out but Channel 5 hopes to fill in some of the gaps by securing carriage on cable and satellite systems.Channel 5 plans what it calls a stripped and stranded schedule .
Behind the jargon lies an attempt to make it easier for viewers to know what is on at a particular time.A stripped show runs on consecutive days , at the same time each day while a stranded show rotates with other similar shows in the same slot each day.Channel 5 will show a daily soap at 1830 , its main evening news will be at 2000 and it will have a film at 2100 every evening .
Films lined up include Speed , Independence day and Mrs Doubtfire. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8793 Britain 's Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television Holdings Plc , a likely bid target for rival broadcasters , said on Tuesday it believed any offer would have to be at a hefty premium to its current share price.YTT chairman and chief executive Ward Thomas told a news conference that he believed a bid from northern neighbour Granada Group Plc was extremely likely.Granada has built up a stake of 27 percent in YTT , the ITV commercial television broadcaster to northern cities such as Leeds and Newcastle , and has long been expected to mount a bid.That speculation has pushed YTT shares up by some 80 percent over the past 14 months to their current level of around 12.50 pounds ( $ 20.07 ) , giving the company a value of around 800 million pounds , including warrants.But Thomas suggested any realistic bid would have to be pitched at around 17 pounds per share.I say 17 pounds to Gerry ( Granada chairman Gerry Robinson ) , Thomas told Reuters in a telephone interview.It 's a conversational gambit , he added.United News & amp ; Media Plc , which already operates ITV franchises for southern and eastern England , is another potential predator , with a stake of some 14 percent in YTT.Thomas was speaking after YTT announced a 40 percent rise in 1996 pre-tax profit to 30.2 million pounds .
It paid a total dividend for the year of 18 pence per share , against 14 in 1995.YTT shares were down 7-1/2 pence at 12.40 pounds at 1430 GMT.Thomas said that YTT 's profitability could be greatly enhanced if it succeeded in its campaign to have its annual licence fee reduced from an annual 66 million pounds and improved its share of ITV advertising income.YTT is urging a return to a special duty on advertising , which was originally introduced in 1961 but later scrapped.Thomas argued that the duty should be applied to all broadcasters including pay television operator BSkyB and the Channel Four commercial station , both currently outside the licence fee system.Thomas called YTT 's 1996 share of ITV advertising revenue disappointing after it fell to 10.3 percent of ITV income.It is in talks with Laser , its advertising sales agency , to market the whole of northern England as a single region .
The fact that Laser is owned by Granada , the ITV broadcaster in north-west England , could facilitate this move .
( $ 1=.6228 Pound ) EMI , one of the world 's top five music companies , said on Tuesday it expected strong sales in the current quarter to propel it to modest profit growth this year.EMI , which has atists ranging from Sixties idols The Beatles to newcomers The Spice Girls , reported profit before tax and exceptional items fell about six percent to 293.3 million pounds ( $ 480 million ) in the nine months to December 31.The fall would have been under one percent at constant exchange rates but the strength of sterling wiped 16 million pounds off operating profit in the period.Finance Director Simon Duffy said that EMI still expected to meet share analysts ' forecasts for full year pre-tax profit of 380-400 million pounds , excluding exceptional gains .
He was confident of achieving that target despite an anticipated 25 million pound hit caused by currency factors.EMI had 1996 pre-tax profit of 367 million pounds .
Apple Computer Inc. said Friday it will cut 4,100 jobs , or nearly a third of its work force , and discontinue its consumer computer line in a bid to slash costs and return to profits.The restructuring , the second in a year , will cost Apple a total of $ 250 million in charges to earnings for the next three quarters , the company said.Meanwhile , Apple expects revenue for its fiscal second quarter , ending March , to plunge 22 percent to about $ 1.6 billion because of weak Macintosh sales.Apple said it plans to drop its Macintosh Performa PCs , the models geared toward home users , to concentrate on its more profitable Power Macintosh line.It 's very painful to have to lay off people who have worked so hard during the past year in trying to bring Apple back to health , Chairman Gilbert Amelio said .
But Apple needs to cut $ 500 million in annual costs just to break even this year , he said.Apple was bold to cut so many jobs and to discontinue one of its key brands , analysts said .
But the company still does not have a clear plan to get sales going again.The company is on the aggressive side on reducing costs , said Walter Winnitzki , an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York .
But the issue for me is , can Apple reignite its sales momentum ? Hampering Apple 's efforts to reignite sales , the company also said it will not ship a long-awaited revamped operating system -- the software that controls the basic functions of its PCs -- until at least June 1998 , about six months later than the company had previously said.Investors and Apple customers have been counting on the new operating system , code-named Rhapsody , to give Apple 's computers a clear technological lead over PCs using technology from Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp.The uncertainty surrounding the Cupertino , Calif.-based computer maker will keep customers away from the Mac isle at computer stores , analysts said.The job cuts include 2,700 full-time employees and 1,400 contract workers .
Apple plans to give employees 60-day notices later this month .
Before the layoffs , Apple employed about 13,400 including contract workers.In the fiscal second quarter ending March 31 , Apple will take a $ 155 million charge against earnings to cover the cost of the layoffs .
The company also plans to take another $ 322.5 million charge for the December acquisition of Next Software Inc.Fred Anderson , Apple 's finance chief , declined to say what the company 's total loss in the second quarter will be , but analysts said their preliminary estimates are close to $ 1 billion.With the cost cuts , Apple could return to profit by the fiscal fourth quarter ending September , Anderson said.Apple , which invented the first user-friendly computer , has suffered in recent years from missed opportunities , management turmoil and failed products.Amelio , who took over in early 1996 , has been refocusing Apple 's effort on its healthiest businesses .
As part of the restructuring , Apple will drop development of software based on the so-called OpenDoc technology and computer servers based on International Business Machines Corp. 's AIX standard .
Apple also will stop development of its video-conferencing products.The company will keep its Newton handheld computer for now , Apple said .
The Newton was expected to be discontinued or sold to another company as part of Friday 's restructuring.Amelio has been under increasing pressure from shareholders and loyal customers to come up with new products to get sales going again.On Friday , he dismissed calls for him to step down.Why would I step aside when we are at the cusp of turning this around ?
he told reporters .
Intel Corp. said Monday its first-quarter net income more than doubled , but its better-than-expected performance was overshadowed by a warning that it expected little revenue growth in the second quarter.Intel , the world 's biggest chipmaker , also said the number of chips it shipped in the first quarter was flat compared with the fourth quarter .
That suggested its new line of Pentium microprocessors with souped-up multimedia capabilities is not helping to boost personal computer sales , analysts said.It was a solid quarter , showing Intel 's dominance , said Peter Andrew , analyst at investment bank AG Edwards in St. Louis .
But the flat revenue projection could upset some people.Intel , based in Santa Clara , Calif. , said net income rose to $ 1.98 billion , or $ 2.20 a share , from $ 849 million , or $ 1.02 a share , in the same quarter a year ago.Wall Street expected Intel , based in Santa Clara , Calif. , to earn $ 2.07 a share , according to a recent First Call analyst survey.First-quarter revenue rose 39 percent to $ 6.45 billion from $ 4.64 billion in the same quarter a year ago.Intel , however , said it expects revenue in the second quarter -- when PC sales tradionally pick up from the after-Christmas lull -- to be flat or only slightly higher compared with the first quarter.Intel is a bellwether for the entire computer industry .
Flat sales could mean PC sales have plateaued for now , said Drew Peck , analyst at Cowen & amp ; Co. in Boston.On top of the flat revenue , Intel plans to boost marketing expenses by 7 percent to 9 percent in the second quarter.When you factor in these guidelines , you would have to expect earnings to be down in the second quarter compared with the first , Peck said.Intel released its earnings after the market closed .
Its shares had closed up $ 3.25 at $ 133.75 .
The stock initially rose in after-hours trading but then fell as low as $ 129.25 due to concerns over the revenue forecast.Intel executives told analysts in a conference call that it had strong demand for its new high-end chips , the Pentium Pro and Pentium with MMX media enhancement technology.The company also said it expects strong demand for its Pentium II microprocessor .
Scheduled to be launched in May , Pentium II crunches numbers much faster than its predecessors.Intel said its revenue in the first quarter rose in all geographic regions except the Americas .
Asia-Pacific revenue , which accounts for about 20 percent of Intel 's total , almost doubled.At the end of the month , the company also will cut some of its chip prices -- some analysts have estimated by as much as 20 percent.Intel cuts its chip prices regularly about once a quarter .
While the cuts are expected to drive PC prices down and increase demand , some investors have seen it as a defensive move against rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp.Two weeks ago , Advanced Micro revealed the K6 microprocessor , a chip that works faster than high-end Pentium chips but costs 25 percent less.Cyrix , another competitor , has been selling a high-powered Pentium knock-off since the beginning of the year that sells for much less than comparable offerings from Intel.Even with the conservative revenue forecast and the first real threat of competition in years , Intel is one of the strongest stocks , analysts said.International markets are booming , which could offset slowing PC sales growth in the U.S. , said Martin Pyykkonen , analyst at investment bank Furman Selz in New York.And business software based on Microsoft Corp. 's Windows NT is driving demand for Intel 's speedy chips , he said .
Apple Computer Inc. Thursday launched the second wave of a massive advertising campaign started earlier this year to raise the profile of its computers and rebuild its tarnished image.In 16 U.S. daily newspapers , Apple 's eight page inserts , headlined Only Apple , touted the benefits of its new products , including a speedy Power Macintosh for home and small-business use , and a Mac that can run programmes written for Microsoft Corp. 's Windows , the dominant operating system software for personal computers.The advertising campaign is part of Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio 's promise to shareholders in January to put the troubled company 's marketing department back on the attack.Apple , which virtually created the personal computer 20 years ago with an easy-to-use machine , has been struggling amid fierce competition from cheaper PCs based on technology from Microsoft and semiconductor giant Intel Corp.In recent months , Apple 's products have been overshadowed by dismal financial results , management turmoil and takeover speculation.Just last week , Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal disclosed he had purchased more than 5 percent of Apple , fuelling speculation he might team up with Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Larry Ellison to acquire the company.Industry analysts said the advertisements were an effort by the Cupertino , Calif.-based computer maker to draw attention away from its dismal financial performance and back to its new products.A week from now they 're going to release what can be considered really bad news , said Tim Bajarin , president of market research firm Creative Strategies Research International .
This is a preemptive move to get people off the bad news and onto the good news , which is some really exciting new products.Next week , Apple is expected to report a loss of more than $ 500 million for the second quarter of fiscal 1997 , bringing its total red ink over the last six quarters to more than $ 1.5 billion.In addition to a couple of one-time items -- a charge for laying off 4,100 workers and another charge for acquiring Next Software Inc. , Apple 's second quarter is also expected to feature a hefty operating loss , reflecting slower than expected sales of its flagship Macintosh line.Experts say Apple 's new line of computers should help slow down its eroding market share but it remains to be seen if Apple can regain its former glory.The new products are the best they 've had in a long , long time , and will help them stay afloat , said Scott Miller , computer industry analyst at market researcher Dataquest .
The advertising for the products is icing on the cake.Apple declined to comment on how much the campaign costs , but it is certainly more than the $ 1.6 million Apple spent in 1984 to tout the Macintosh in a brash TV spot aired during the Super Bowl .
The 60-second spot , featuring an athlete hurling a hammer at a huge video screen helped establish Apple as an innovative company out to change the world.Since 1993 , Apple 's share of the worldwide computer market has been cut almost in half , tumbling to 5.2 percent in 1996 from 9.4 percent in 1993.Apple customers and shareholders had criticised Amelio for not having done enough to tout the Macintosh 's ease-of-use and technical superiority over Windows-based personal computers.Apple started the current campaign in February , with two-page advertisments in newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times .
The previous advertisements and the ones unveiled Thursday focus on the Mac 's technical superiority.Apple plans to run more ads in coming days .
The company also is planning more multi-page spreads in coming months as new products come out .
The lean times for the video game software industry appear to be over.Three of the largest game developers on Thursday reported results for the crucial December quarter that were better than Wall Street expected.Electronic Arts Inc. , Activision Inc. and Spectrum Holobyte Inc. said strong sales of games for personal computers and next-generation video game consoles , such as the Sony PlayStation , contributed to the strong results.For the past year , the video game software industry had been in a funk while consumers waited for the release of advanced game machines from Sony Corp. , Sega Enterprises and Nintendo Corp .
The industry also lacked blockbusters to draw customers to the video game isle at stores.The release of the PlayStation last year and the Nintendo 64 this year has revitalised the industry , analysts said.People are underestimating how truly red hot sales of the video game systems are , said David Farina , an analyst at brokerage William Blair & amp ; Co. in Chicago .
If history is any guide , we 're in for a strong two-year cycle for my investors , cross my finger.After the market closed , Electronic Arts , the biggest U.S. game publisher , said net income for its fiscal third quarter , ended Dec. 31 , rose 25 percent to $ 36.7 million , or 66 cents a share , from $ 29.3 million , or 54 cents , in the same quarter a year ago.Electronic Arts ' revenue in the quarter jumped 13 percent to $ 271.1 million from $ 240.1 million on strong sales of games for the PlayStation and PCs , the company said.Activision , another big game vendor , said net income in its Christmas quarter more than doubled to $ 4.12 million , or 28 cents , from $ 1.95 million , or 13 cents , a year ago.Spectrum Holobyte , based in Alameda , Calif. , said net income in the December quarter was $ 5.7 million , or 20 cents a share , more than double the 9 cents Wall Street expected .
In the same quarter last year , Spectrum Holobyte had a loss of $ 9.95 million , or 41 cents a share.The strong earnings likely will continue into the March quarter , analysts said , as consumers buy a new generation of PCs based on Intel Corp. 's MMX technology , which soups up the graphics capabilities of the machines .
The stock of Apple Computer Inc. rose in heavy trading Thursday on a report that the chairman of software company Oracle Corp. said once again he was interested in buying the troubled computer maker.Larry Ellison , Oracle chairman , told the San Jose Mercury News Wednesday that he was forming an investor group to raise $ 1 billion to buy a majority stake in Apple.Ellison , a flamboyant software billionaire , has said since April 1995 that he would like to buy Apple with his own money , partly to prevent Microsoft Corp. from dominating the computer industry.Based on its stock price , Apple is worth $ 2.17 billion .
Ellison 's stake in Oracle is worth about $ 6 billion.Apple rose $ 2.25 to $ 19 , while Oracle fell $ 1.125 to $ 39.375 on Nasdaq , where both stocks were among the most active issues in late trading.Ellison told the newspaper he was publicly reasserting his interest in buying Apple partly to gauge investor support in the next few days .
Based on the reaction , he will decide soon whether to make a bid.Previously , he has said he approached unidentified big investors about a joint bid .
He also has mulled the idea with his friend Steve Jobs , the Apple co-founder who was kicked out of the company in 1985 and returned in December as a part-time advisor to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio.Ellison could not be reached for comment .
Katie Cotton , Apple spokeswoman , said the Cupertino , Calif.-based company had no comments about Ellison.Wall Street analysts said they doubted Ellison actually would attempt to buy Apple because he has not taken any concrete steps in the two years that he has expressed an interest.The deal does n't make sense for ( any outside investor ) to take him up on it , said David Wu , analyst at investment bank ABN Ambro Chicago Corp.Still , Ellison 's comments should not be dismissed , some analysts said.It would be a mistake to analyse this as a pure business issue , as there is substantial ego involved , said Paul Saffo , a tracker of Apple and Ellison and a research fellow at Institute for the Future , a Silicon Valley think tank.Ellison , the third-richest software tycoon behind Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen , is intent on slowing Microsoft 's dominance of the software industry , he has said in recent interviews .
Apple , with its huge following of Macintosh fans , could be a key weapon.Saffo also said Jobs , since returning to Apple late last year , has been very influential in trimming the company , and could be sprucing up Apple for an acquisition.Jobs recently became a member of the Apple board following Apple 's $ 400 million acquisition of his Next Software Inc.Apple has suffered declining market share for its famous brand of easy-to-use computers and endured several rounds of restructuring in recent years .
The stock has languished in the mid-teens since early January and is at a 10-year low.In mid-March , the company said it planned to discontinue several product lines and lay off 4,000 employees , or one-third of its staff , in its latest bid to slash costs and turn the company around .
Computer network equipment maker 3Com Corp. Thursday reported a 17 percent rise in third-quarter profits , an unusually small rate for the company.3Com executives told investors , however , they expect business to pick up again in the fourth quarter and said that , contrary to fears among Wall Street investors , the industry does not face an extracted slowdown.We do not expect that the demand weakness we saw in December will recur , said Eric Benhamou , 3Com chief executive .
The fundamentals of the industry remain very strong and the potential remains for the industry to sustain growth rates in the 30 to 50-percent range in the coming years.3Com , the second-biggest maker of networking equipment after Cisco Systems Inc. , said net income rose to $ 87.6 million , or 47 cents a share , from $ 74.6 million , or 42 cents , in the same quarter a year ago.The company announced last month it was acquiring consumer computer modem giant U.S. Robotics Corp. in a stock deal valued at $ 7.3 billion.Wall Street , after having been warned a month ago by executives that the company faced a difficult quarter , expected 3Com to earn 46 cents a share , according to a recent survey by First Call.Revenue for the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 30 percent to $ 786.8 million from $ 606 million a year ago.3Com makes electronic devices that send information through computer networks .
In December , the company had unusually weak sales because of falling product prices and aggressive moves by competitors Cisco and Intel Corp.The warning set off a month-long slide of networking stocks and spurred concerns that the industry segment had seen its best days .
Since the warning , 3Com 's shares have lost more than half their value in seven weeks.3Com shares on Thursday closed up $ 1.44 at $ 33.63.It looks like the worst is behind them , although it could take at least a quarter or two for them to get things back in line , said Noel Lindsey , analyst at investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. in San Francisco.Benhamou 's positive remarks also likely will boost 3Com 's stock Friday , Lindsey said.About 45 percent of 3Com 's revenue comes from the sale of networking adapter cards , the graham-wafer-sized devices that plug into PCs to connect them to networks .
3Com said adapter card revenue rose 39 percent in the third quarter to $ 346.3 million.3Com also sells switches and hubs , the devices that shuffle information through networks .
Sales of these system products rose 24 percent to $ 432.6 million.Benhamou said the company is bringing expenses in line with revenue .
He also said strong sales throughout Asia is offsetting weakness in Japan .
Similarly , strong British sales are mitigating weak sales in Germany , he said.During the quarter , we saw strong demand for our high-end network equipment , 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou said in a statement , and the number of multimillion-dollar orders we received from large accounts has never been greater.At the same time , our industry is in the midst of many important transitions , Benhamou added , citing the adoption of higher-speed technologies , new methods for directing network traffic and pricing and distribution increasingly based on volume sales.He said that as a result of these changes , 3Com 's results in the latest quarter reflected increased price competition and a pause in industry demand as corporate networking customers and network service providers assess how to maximize their investments in computer networks.But he added the changes were positive for 3Com and the industry in the long run.The acquisition of U.S. Robotics , the leading worldwide maker of modems for the consumer market , will create a company with annual revenues topping $ 5 billion.Under terms of the agreement , each share of Skokie , Ill.-based U.S. Robotics will be exchanged for 1.75 shares of 3Com stock .
Intel Corp. on Wednesday will unveil its Pentium II microprocessor , a speedy computer chip that will help the world 's biggest chip maker break into new markets and stave off rivals.The new chip is based on the Intel 's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro , but includes software and circuitry -- dubbed MMX technology -- that makes it more adept at handling graphics .
In most cases , it works 30 percent to 40 percent faster than today 's mainstream Intel products , analysts said.About a dozen personal computer makers will announce Wednesday they plan to use the chip in high-end machines , said Richard Dracott , Intel marketing manager.Most of the new Pentium II machines will be desktop PCs aimed at engineers and professionals who use a lot of computing horsepower for graphics , analysts said.Although the Pentium II is a souped-up version of the Pentium Pro , it is the biggest product introduction for Intel in years , said Mark Kirstein , research director at semiconductor market researcher In-Stat in Scottsdale , Ariz.The Pentium Pro was really a niche product for high-end desktops and servers , the computers that control networks , Kirstein said .
The Pentium II is aimed at the mainstream.A streamlined design and cheaper production will make it easier for Intel to churn out the new chip , Kirstein said.Within a year , most new PCs -- even the ones geared for home use -- will be based on the Pentium II , analysts said.Intel , based in Santa Clara , Calif. , also is trying to pitch the chip to new kinds of customers .
The company has told video game makers , for example , that the chip can handle the intense graphics requirements of coin-operated arcade games.We will be delivering significant performance improvement over the fastest Pentium Pro , Dracott said.Intel said part of the performance improvement comes from a new so-called cartridge design .
The Pentium II will be sold to PC manufacturers in a plastic housing that includes specialised memory chips .
Because the microprocessor and memory chips are packed closely together on a seperate circuit board , they can pump data to the rest of the PC much faster , Intel said.There is one more benefit : It frustrates Intel rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp. , which for the first time are a credible threat to Intel.AMD and Cyrix make chips that work like the Pentium and sell them to PC makers for much less .
But their chips are designed to fit into the old slots for microprocessors.AMD spent the past two years working on the K6 chip , which works as fast as the Pentium Pro and is 25 percent cheaper , but does not fit into the new cartridge slot.Since most of the PC makers are expected to use Intel 's cartridge design , AMD now has to spend time and money to make the K6 compatible .
Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday said it plans to release an operating system that will work on personal computers based on chips from Intel Corp. as well as on Apple computers.At its annual developer conference , the company also said it will release programming tools in the next few months that will allow companies to write software for Apple computers once and automatically convert their products to run on PCs based on Intel chips and Microsoft Corp. Windows software.The radical strategy is part of Apple 's plan to keep software companies from abandoning Apple products , Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio told a crowd of 1,900 programmers here.For those of you who seek substantial business on both the Mac and Windows platforms , this new development environment holds tremendous promise , Amelio said .
You can ( write your applications once ) and with a simple recompilation release them for both platforms.Until now , Apple has released operating system software that only runs on Apple-designed hardware.Amelio said Apple 's next-generation operating system , code-named Rhapsody , will not only run on Apple-designed computers , but also on PCs based on Intel chips and using Microsoft Windows software.For the past two years , Apple has been scrambling to come up with improvements to the Macintosh that would set it apart from PCs .
Until 1995 , Apple had relied on its computers ' famed ease-of-use as a selling point , but Microsoft 's release of Windows 95 took away much of the impact of Apple 's pitch.Last year , Apple gave up on a mired effort to revamp the Macintosh Operating System , the fundamental programme that gives the Mac its look .
In December , the company bought Next Software Inc. to get its software overhaul going again , and to use its software as the foundation of a next-generation operating system.The move concerned lots of programmers , though , because of fears that the new operating system would not run the products they designed for the older Mac operating system .
Programmers also were not thrilled to develop products for yet another operating system.Apple plans to spend the rest of this week convincing programmers that it is a worthwhile investment to write software for Rhapsody.Programmes written for Rhapsody will be able to run on old Macs , a new class of Apple machines using the Rhapsody operating system , and PCs running the Windows operating system , Amelio promised.Investors , however , evidently decided to wait a while before rendering judgment , and Apple 's stock ended unchanged at $ 17.5625 on Nasdaq .
Versant Object Technology Corp , a database software company , expects to do more business with MCI Communications Corp despite a stalled project last summer , Versant 's chief executive said.We anticipate ongoing business from MCI , said David Banks , CEO of Versant , based in Menlo Park , Calif .
They are still a customer of ours .
They are using our licenses in existing projects and there are new projects on the horizon .
A lot is riding on Versant 's relationship with MCI .
Ever since the long-distance phone company put a major project to revamp its billing system on hold , Versant 's stock has been in a funk.Versant was supplying MCI with some of the fundamental software for the project .
So when MCI last summer halted work to re-evaluate the project , code-named Horizon , investors assumed the worse about Versant and guessed the software company was the cause of the snafu , analysts said .
Versant 's stock plummeted from a high of 28-3/8 in late November to as low as 8 three weeks ago .
On Tuesday , Versant was unchanged at 14-3/4.In 1996 , Versant 's sales of software to MCI totaled about $ 4.8 million , or about 26 percent of the $ 18.4 million reported for the year.There have been rumors going around Wall Street implying that the relationship between MCI and Versant went sour , said James Mendelson , an analyst at brokerage SoundView Financial .
I do n't believe Versant was at fault .
Banks said he could not discuss the technical details of Horizon , or why it was halted , because of a confidentiality contract with MCI .
An MCI spokesman said the company simply decided to change the goals of the project , and would not comment about Versant 's performance.But analysts said MCI 's actions speak louder than words .
Even though MCI never finished Horizon , MCI paid Versant all the money the software company was due.In June , MCI placed a $ 3.9 million order for Versant software to revamp its billing system .
In September , MCI told Versant that it was re-evaluating the project .
So Versant decided not to recognize revenue from the project in the third quarter .
In the fourth quarter , MCI renegotiated terms of the contract with Versant and paid the software company $ 4.4 million.MCI met all their financial obligations , Banks said .
MCI also is still using Versant software , but Banks declined to say how much more revenue his company would receive from MCI.Mendelson said he expects Versant 's revenue to nearly double in 1997 to $ 30 million as the company finds new customers outside of the telecommunications industry .
Apple Computer Inc. Friday said it plans to cut 4,100 jobs in a restructuring aimed at returning the company to profitability.The troubled computer maker said the restructuring , its second major overhaul in the last 12 months , will result in a $ 155 million charge in its second quarter ending in March.The reserve would be in addition to a planned $ 325 million charge the current quarter for the previously announced purchase of Next Software Inc.The cuts -- including 2,700 full-time employees and 1,400 contract workers -- were slightly less than what some analysts had expected .
Apple said it planned to begin notifying employees about the layoffs later this month.Apple , once the darling of the computer industry , has suffered in recent years from missed opportunities , management turmoil and failed strategies that resulted in the firings of former Chief Executives John Sculley in 1993 and Michael Spindler in 1996.Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio , who took over about a year ago , said the latest restructuring was aimed at boosting Apple 's core business.The top priorities guiding our reorganization are the rapid delivery of distinctive products for our loyal business , education , and home customers , and the development of a robust next-generation operating system to carry them into the future , Amelio said in a statement.We can best achieve these goals by streamlining our organization , simplifying our product lines to deliver fewer but much stronger models , and stopping investments in activities that are not central to these core businesses , he said.Over the last five quarters , Apple has posted more than $ 900 million in losses , reflecting slower sales of its flagship line of Macintosh personal computers and restructuring expenses.In a statement issued after the market closed , Apple said it will phase out its slow-selling Performa Macintosh home computers this spring in favor of Power Mac models.Disappointing Christmas sales of the Performa line led to a stunning $ 120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and a steep decline in Apple 's market share.According to research firm Dataquest , Apple 's share of the worldwide PC market tumbled to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent in 1995.As part of the restructuring , Apple said it was exploring options for its Netwon hand-held personal assistant and will no longer produce Apple-branded Pippin devices , which enable television sets to access the Internet.While Apple will continue to enhance its Mac Operating System , the company said some parts of the system -- such as the Open Doc component software technology , Cyberdog , Open Transport , Game Sprockets , and Mac OS Development Tools -- will receive less money for upgrades.Apple will also halt funding for the Video Conferencing Solution and AIX Server Software.The moves are aimed at cutting Apple 's expenses by at least $ 400 million a year so the company can be profitable with revenues of around $ 8 billion.Apple said it was revising the delivery schedule for future Mac Operating System releases but still plans to deliver its latest version , code-named Rhapsody , in 1998 .
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said on Wednesday that French President Jacques Chirac was reluctant to allow private companies to use highly encrypted code for messages and transactions on the Internet.We had one problem with the U.S. government , now we have a second one with France , Gates told a news conference after meeting Chirac for more than an hour at the Elysee Palace.We should be able in France to use strong encryption , he added .
Encryption makes messages and transactions safe on the Internet but also makes them harder to track by authorities.Gates , who was in France as part of a European tour , also discussed education with Chirac and stressed the importance of computer literacy for future competitiveness.It 's not the gap in Internet use ( between the United States and Europe ) of today that counts .
It 's the gap in 10 years ' time that will be important , he said.His private foundation will support European school computer projects with the first French projects expected in 1997.Gates , perhap the richest man in the world , said he wanted to spend most of his wealth on such projects and charity .
Ninety-five percent of my wealth will be returned to society , not to my heirs , he said.In a keynote speech to the Comdex/IT forum computer show , Gates said an important feature for future Microsoft products would be simplicity to make computers easier to use.He said that although in the past personal computer prices had remained stable while the machines ' power and features increased dramatically , he now expected prices to come down.Microsoft unveiled its Office 97 software package , integrating Internet and Intranet capabilities with its familiar productivity tools , at the show.Jean-Philippe Courtois of Microsoft France said France ranked ninth in both the number of Internet users and web sites.He said he expected three million personal computers to be sold in France in 1997 -- 700,000 of them to households.Gates said only a small part of the installed computer base was linked up to the net and strong growth was to be expected .
He also foresaw a mix between personal computers and television.On that theme , Jacques Segela , vice president of Havas Advertising , said ads would become more personal and interactive than the broadly targetted and often blunt messages broadcast on television.In three years ' time , people will invest more in ads on the net than on television , he said.Roel Pieper , chief executive of Tandem Computers Inc. , said an expected shift to Internet transactions from online transactions ( like cash machines ) would need secure , scalable clusters of computers and high-capacity telecommunications networks -- land lines as well as mobiles and pagers.He said telecoms operators would be able to tap a new market in selling information about the use of their network , something which is already happening in the United States but breaches privacy laws in some European countries.Herbert Budd , general manager Business Intelligence Solutions at IBM , told Reuters that many companies do not use the full potential of their data.IBM and other companies are proposing to build data warehouses .
IBM is also developing SurfAid , due out in the United States in the first half of 1997 , to facilitate searches of text and data on the Internet.Budd said such business solutions would represent a market of $ 30 billion in 2000 , compared with between $ 6 and $ 8 billion currently .
French conglomerate Generale des Eaux looked set to extend its power in the media industry after revealing on Monday it was in talks with Havas , primarily about pay-television company Canal Plus .Havas and Compagnie Generale des Eaux confirm discussions are now in progress concerning their respective interests in audiovisual activities , primarily Canal Plus , said a joint statement from Generale des Eaux and Havas.The announcement , which was rushed out before the stock exchange opened , followed press reports that the companies were preparing a deal which would make Generale des Eaux the key shareholder in Havas .
That , in turn , would make the Havas media group the biggest shareholder in Canal Plus.The companies added in a joint statement that they would not comment further pending board meetings scheduled for February 6.The prospect of a major transformation of the French media landscape gained weight when a corporate source confirmed that Alcatel Alsthom was in talks about a possible sale of part of its 21.2 percent stake in Havas to Generale des Eaux.Generale des Eaux , already a powerful force in the water and telecommmunications industry , owns almost 20 percent of Canal Plus .
The satellite broadcaster is itself merging with fellow-pay-TV group Nethold to create Europe 's largest subscription television company.According to French newspapers , Generale des Eaux would transfer its Canal Plus stake into Havas , almost doubling Havas 's current 21.6 percent stake in the broadcaster .
Havas would then increase its own capital to allow Generale des Eaux a bigger stake.Other major shareholders in Canal Plus are the bank Societe Generale , with 4.5 percent , and the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations with 6.9 percent.Generale des Eaux would also become indirectly the biggest shareholder in the merged Canal Plus company .
Havas would establish its direct dominance within Canal Plus , well ahead of Nethold 's owners , Richemont and MIH , which have 15 and 4.9 percent repectively.Alcatel has owned 21.2 percent of Havas since selling its media business to Havas in 1995 in return for shares in Havas , which it was obliged to hold on to for at least two years.The initial market reaction was broadly positive .
Havas shares soared and those of Generale jumped too .
It 's a good deal for all parties involved , one share dealer said.Alcatel stands to make a capital gain on the sale , as well as receiving cash , because the Havas share price has increased a lot over the past year , in line with a French stock market which is at record highs.Alcatel needs money to finance its planned acquisition , if the state permits it , of the government 's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF .The government is due to announce its Thomson-CSF sale plans shortly , after scrapping its original privatisation plan in December.Newspapers have for months speculated about the Havas share structure , although Generale des Eaux has in the past denied plans to raise its stake.On the share market , Havas shares opened up eight percent but then gave in some of the gains to trade 5.3 percent up at 427 francs.Generale des Eaux was 0.7 percent up at 713 , but Canal Plus was 0.93 percent lower at 1,171 and Alcatel slipped 0.55 percent to 545 francs .
French state agencies met on Friday to rubber stamp an 11 billion franc ( $ 2.09 billion ) capital injection of state aid in electronics group Thomson SA , as the government reviewed options for reviving its sale.Thomson labour unions , with the support of many other labour groups , were planning a big demonstration in Paris later to demand the total cancellation of the group 's privatisation after its controversial sale was suspended earlier this week.Finance Minister Jean Arthuis , under political pressure to come up quickly with ways to restore France 's reputation on international markets , was working on how to relaunch the sale process.He must also find ways to mollify South Korea , which was outraged by the decision to suspend the privatisation because the independent Privatisation Commission did not agree with the terms of the planned sale of Thomson 's consumer electronics subsidiary Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics.Inside Thomson 's Paris headquarters state shareholders were holding an extraordinary meeting to vote on the capital increase that is needed to bolster the company 's balance sheet ahead of a sale.Representatives of France Telecom and the CDR state holding company , which owns former Credit Lyonnais assets , met to agree the aid package , which has also to win approval from the European Commission in Brussels.A spokesman for Dutch-based Philips Electronics denied a rumour the company had lodged an official complaint.One issue that Arthuis has to settle is whether to restart the sale from the beginning and invite new tenders , or to limit negotiations to the two finalists in the orginal process -- the winner Lagardere Groupe and Alcatel Alsthom.He must also decide whether to abandon France 's preference for the defence and electronics group to be sold as a whole rather than in parts .
Arthuis has said he his willing to consider a split before a sale.The influential Les Echos financial newspaper said on Friday that if the government insisted on a package sale , Alcatel Alsthom stood the best chances of winning .
Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk recently suggested the state should sell Thomson SA as a whole , but in tranches.If the government accepted a split , Lagardere Groupe could still obtain control of 58-percent defence unit Thomson-CSF , Les Echos said.Whatever the solution , Arthuis faces a series of problems.South Korea 's Deputy Prime Minister Han Seung-son told French ambassador Dominique Perreau in Seoul on Friday that the Thomson decision had caused worries to many people in South Korea.French companies have recently won huge orders from Korea , including a TGV high-speed train deal , and are vying for a multi-billion combat aircraft order.Another problem is the risk of a spillover into other privatisations .
International investors are expressing their dislike of the French decision and trades unions see the climbdown at Thomson as a sign they can win elsewhere.The Communist-led CGT union said on Friday the government should also suspend the planned sale of France Telecom .
Billed as France 's biggest stock market flotation , it is set for next spring .
( $ 1=5.270 French Franc ) French food group Saint Louis on Tuesday tightened its grip on the Spanish sugar sector by acquiring a 15 percent stake in Spain 's biggest sugar company and second-largest food group Ebro Agricolas.Analysts welcomed the move and Saint Louis shares closed 3.17 percent higher at 1,369 francs ( $ 255.3 ) on the Paris Bourse while the CAC-40 blue chip index ended 1.73 percent higher.I think they want to have a controlling stake in Spanish sugar-making but I do not believe that the political powers there will allow them to do so quickly .
They have to go slow , said a Paris-based food sector analyst.The company 's Generale Sucriere unit bought the 15 percent stake from Banco Santander .
Spanish newspapers said the deal was for 17.14 billion pesetas ( $ 129.4 million ) .A Saint Louis spokesman declined to comment on the price but said Ebro had a market value of 110 billion pesetas , annual sales of 154 billion pesetas and a market share of 54 percent.Saint Louis already has a stake of about 21 percent in Sociedad General de Azucarera de Espana ( Azucarera ) , Spain 's second-largest sugar group.The two Spanish groups said in December they were working on a merger which would create the European Union 's fifth largest sugar group .
Ebro bought a 21.8 percent stake in Azucarera from bank Banco Central Hispano ( BCH ) in November.Saint Louis chairman Daniel Melin has said he wants to have a stake of 20 to 25 percent in the merged group , which would produce 80 percent of Spain 's European Union sugar quota.We would now have a 17 percent stake in a merged group which is in line with our policy .
We do not want to rise above 25 percent because we would have to make a bid for the rest .
We want to be a shareholder , not an operator , Saint Louis spokesman Olivier Labesse said.Spain 's Ministry of Agriculture has in the past blocked attempts by the French group to increase its stake in Azucarera as part of a general policy of stopping foreign companies taking control of the Spanish sugar market.I believe Saint Louis will try to get a majority and restructure the new company where there is a lot of scope for cost savings .
The Spanish ministry may be against it and they can huff and puff but I do not really see how they can block it , a London-based analyst said.There will be a lot of political opposition to a majority stake , said Dominique Bastien of brokerage Pinatton Wargny.BCH has sold another 24 percent in Ebro to a savings bank , Caja de Salamanca .
The Kuwait Investment Office ( KIO ) is Ebro 's largest shareholder with a 35 percent stake , while state-owned food group Mercase is expected to increase its 4.7 percent holding by buying BCH 's remaining 4.1 percent stake.Dresdner Kleinwort Benson financial analyst Charles Manso welcomed the Ebro deal and said he was reviewing his Saint Louis recommendation and might raise it from hold.This is the second bit of good news in two days .
We have to factor that in .
I think today 's deal is slightly earnings enhancing , Manso said.On Monday , Saint Louis said it was closing its sugar plant at Bresles in France as part of a rationalisation of its production structure.The new management has been in place for 18 months now and they are doing the right things , Manso said.Saint Louis is the fourth largest sugar group in Europe behind Germany 's Suedzucker , Britain 's Tate and Lyle Plc and France 's Eridania Beghin-Say.The group is controlled by Bank Worms et Cie , which has a 27.8 percent stake and Italy 's IFIL SpA , an Agnelli family finance company , with a 25.9 percent stake .
( $ 1=132.5 Peseta ) ( $ 1=5.363 French Franc ) French oil groups Total SA and Elf Aquitaine said on Monday that they had signed contracts with Iraq to buy crude oil under a United Nations oil-for-food deal with Baghdad.Total said it had signed a contract to take 30,000 barrels of oil per day ( bpd ) , conditional on United Nations approval.We reached an agreement with the Iraqis at the end of last week to take 30,000 barrels per day .
We now await approval of the United Nations , a spokesman for Total said.At Elf Aquitaine a spokesman said the company had signed a three-month deal but declined to say how much oil it would take.I do not know whether we have permission from the UN overseers .
We signed on Friday and have submitted it for approval , an Elf spokesman said.Under the U.N. programme , Iraq may sell $ 2 billion of crude oil to finance purchases of food and medicine to ease the plight of Iraqi civilians bearing the consequences of international economic sanctions.The plan was agreed in principle in May after months of negotiations but the U.N. delayed signing the deal after an Iraqi assault on Kurdish rebels until early this month.Under the plan , oil companies will reimburse Iraq for the oil through payments into an Iraqi account in New York to finance purchases of food and medicine.The strain on daily life is fuelling opposition to President Saddam Hussein .
Two opposition groups in exile have claimed responsibility for an attack last week on Hussein 's son Uday.Mitsubishi Corp of Japan was the first company on Monday to say it had signed a deal .
It signed an accord on Friday to take 40,000 bpd.The United Nations has so far approved five contracts .
U.S. firms Coastal Corp and Bay Oil on Sunday began lifting crude oil from the southern export outlet of Mina al-Bakr.Other companies granted U.N. approval include Turkish state oil company TUPRAS and Italy 's Oil Energy.TUPRAS was the first to get U.N. permission .
Much of the oil will be exported through a pipeline to Ceyhan in Turkey which opened last week.On Monday the first tanker with Iraqi oil left Ceyhan while tow tankers are loading at Mina al-Bakr.The French oil companies resumed contacts with Iraq shortly after the Gulf war and Elf is in talks to extract oil from the Majnoon field in southern Iraq -- with an estimated capacity of 300,000 bpd -- while Total wants to develop the giant Nahr Umar field which could have a capacity of 500,000 bpd.Elf and Total have been in talks with Iraq since 1992 and always worked within the framework of the 1990 United Nations sanctions imposed after the invasion of Kuwait.French firms are also lining up deals to sell wheat to Bagdad for the first time in six years.Traders will have to submit their offers on Tuesday for an auction to sell 100,000 tonnes in French wheat to Iraq for delivery in January and February.Iraq also tendered for between four and six cargoes of lower quality white sugar for delivery between mid-February and early March , sugar traders said .
French State-owned aerospace group Aerospatiale said on Saturday it could make a bid for defence electronics group Thomson-CSF with Dassault Aviation if it obtained government permission.The Le Monde newspaper said Alcatel Alsthom could also join the project to form a big French defence group in response to last week 's merger announcement of Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas Corp.Aerospatiale spokesman Patrice Kreis told Reuters on Saturday that Aerospatiale and fighter plane maker Dassault , in merger talks themselves , were not at the moment actively preparing an offer to acquire Thomson-CSF.At the moment , and I say that after having talked to the boss -- chairman Yves Michot -- a few minutes ago , at the moment we are not working on an offer .
But he confirmed that the chairmen had expressed an interest in acquiring Thomson-CSF.Kreis said the companies had to await the terms of the new procedure for the sale of Thomson-CSF , expected in January , and for the green light from the state as shareholder.We will see in January whether we will work on one or not .
If we are authorised to do so , we will , but only after we now the terms of the ( sale ) procedure , he said.A Ministry of Defence official told Reuters : It is certain that Yves Michot and ( Dassault Aviation chairman ) Serge Dassault are working on an offer.If Aerospatiale and Dassault wanted to make an offer for Thomson-CSF , the government ... would allow them to , Le Monde quoted a Ministry of Defence source as saying.At Alcatel Alsthom there was no immediate comment.In February President Jacques Chirac launched the sale of Thomson SA and urged the merger between Aerospatiale and Dassault as a first step in an industry shake-up.Thomson SA has a 58 percent stake in Thomson-CSF , the remainder being listed on the Paris Bourse .
It also has 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia ( TMM ) .In October , the government said it preferred a bid by Lagardere Groupe over one by Alcatel Alsthom.Lagardere would buy Thomson SA for one franc after a 14 billion franc capital increase and would sell TMM to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea .
Lagardere planned a a bid on the other 42 percent of Thomson-CSF and would merge the company with its Matra Defense Espace unit.The independent Privatisation Commission objected to the TMM sale and the government suspended the procedure early December.The government has since decided to sell Thomson-CSF seperately in early in 1997 and wait with the TMM until 1998.On Friday , the government said it would announce the terms of the Thomson-CSF sale in early January .
One of the issues it has to resolve is whether to decide on a public float or a new tender for an industry sale.Thomson chairman Marcel Roulet is campaigning for a float.The Aerospatiale spokesman said on Saturday that a link with Lagardere was not logical but one with Alcatel was .
It is true that Aerospatiale and Dassault are competitors of Matra , but we are complementary to Alcatel and Thomson-CSF.Aerospatiale is the French partner in the Airbus Industrie consortium with British Aerospace Plc , Germany 's Daimler Aerospace and Spain 's CASA.When the Boeing-McDonnell merger was announced people said that it was a threat to Airbus and that it had to speed up its integration .
But that is not true , the merger is mainly a Pentagon project , an industry source said.Boeing-McDonnell also have Rockwell -- the American Thomson-CSF -- ( and ) their merger is mainly a defence industry challenge , the source added .
The French government is moving edgily towards a key decision for the future of Europe 's defence industry -- whether to privatise defence electronics group Thomson-CSF through a public sale or private placement.The stakes are huge , as the choice of the method of sale will to a large extent determine the final outcome of a far-reaching restructuring in the French defence industry and has major implications for the entire sector in Europe.Like a master chess player , the state must look several moves ahead , decide what sort of defence industry it wants to see in a few years ' time , and ensure the decision will be seen as fair to all involved.Government sources said on Friday that the decision , originally expected at the end of January , would probably slip into early February because the government was studying in great detail all the elements of the politically-sensitive dossier that involves Europe 's biggest defence electronics company.The decision will be taken shortly , but not today .
We are still studying all possibilities , said an official source.The decision will have to be taken by the cabinet .
At the moment there is no proposal to send to the ministers .
I could not tell you when exactly that will happen , he added.Prime Minister Alain Juppe is anxious to avoid another embarassment like the one he suffered on December 4 when the government had to suspend an earlier privatisation plan under which Thomson-CSF would have gone to conglomerate Lagardere Groupe.That deal involved the privatisation of the Thomson group , which included both a 68 percent stake in Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia ( TMM ) .The state was forced to call off the plan because the independent privatisation commission balked at the terms of a sale of TMM to South Korea 's Daewoo Electronics.The cancellation outraged the Korean , who called the decision racist and prompted an angry call for explanation from President Kim Young-sam.Since then the French government has decided to separate the sales of TMM and Thomson-CSF.The ultimate aim of the government is to have a strong defence industry able to supply its armed forces with state-of-the art weaponry and play a leading role in Europe and on the world scene.A year ago , President Jacques Chirac announced a wide-ranging restructuring of the French defence industry around a merged group of Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation for aerospace , and Thomson-CSF for electronics.In France alone , any such restructuring would affect the business of Lagardere , owner of Matra Espace Defense with British Aerospace Plc as a partner , Alcatel Alsthom and its ally GEC Plc , and smaller groups such as Sagem and Compagnie des Signaux.With a public sale through a market float , Thomson-CSF management will have its hands free to pursue its own negotiations about future alliances while interested partners can acquire stakes on the market.But this may mean that a foreign cash-rich group from elsewhere in Europe or from the U.S. or Asia could buy itself into the talks.With a private placement there are two main options.One is by choosing candidates for a sale using a cahier de charges -- a sort of bidding book comprising price , intended strategy and commitments on jobs and investments.This would leave the government with the biggest influence on the outcome , but also with the biggest responsibilty.Another procedure , rare in France , would be to auction the state 's 68-percent stake in Thomson-CSF among qualified bidders , putting the emphasis on price and ensuring the greatest possible revenues for the state at a time France is trying to reduce its public deficits ahead of monetary union .
Nobody expected Serge Tchuruk , chairman of electronics and telecommunications group Alcatel Alsthom , to sit and wait while the state made up its mind what to do with defence group Thomson-CSF.But his audacious move to try and line-up state-owned aerospace group Aerospatiale and Rafale fighter plane builder Dassault came as a surprise to many.Alcatel on Monday confirmed newspaper reports it was talking to the two plane makers about a Thomson offer.The link , if successful , would group most of France 's defence electronics industry players in one camp , with Lagardere Groupe 's Matra Defense Espace in the other.Other players , Sagem and Cie des Signaux , could join either camp at a later stage.For Tchuruk 's gamble to win , however , the government has to decide to sell its 58 percent stake in Thomson-CSF in a private placement , and not through a market float.Alcatel Alsthom has defence businesses with some 10 billion francs in sales which would be transferred to Thomson-CSF , already a global player in defence electronics.Aerospatiale and Dassault , themselves in advanced merger talks , would transfer their missiles and electronics business to Thomson-CSF in exchange for a stake in the group under the Alcatel scheme being discussed , industry sources said.It would turn the remaining Aerospatiale-Dassault group into a pure aerospace platform company , with ties to one of the world 's third biggest defence electronics groups.The enlarged Thomson-CSF would have annual sales of 60 billion francs , against some 35 billion francs currently.The government , as biggest shareholder in the future Aerospatiale-Dassault , has to allow this company to participate in a bid for another company majority-owned by the state.The merger of Aerospatiale with Dassault is expected to be concluded before the spring , after which the new group will be privatised itself.While the government has not publicly expressed its opinion on whether it would allow Aerospatiale to join a Thomson-CSF bid , it has had ample chances to express any opposition.In December , when the first news reports appeared about a possible Aerospatiale/Dassault interest in Thomson-CSF , the Defence and Finance Ministries said such reports were without foundation and premature.Industry sources said that Tchuruk had informed all ministers involved about the possible link with the plane builders and they added that the fact Alcatel confirmed its discussions with the plane makers on Monday was a sign that Tchuruk had not been told to drop his plans.Tchuruk , a 59-year old Marseille-born weapons engineer , had already impressed the independent Privatisation Commission with the industrial logic behind his group 's Thomson-CSF bid.But the government had in October selected Lagardere as preferred bidder because the Matra merger was the best solution for French defence interests.Meanwhile , Alcatel has confirmed its return to profits in 1996 after heavy losses due to one-off charges in 1995.It has sold its interests in mobile telecoms operator SFR and it is in talks to reduce its stake in Havas.Whether that will help convince the government to change its mind remains the question.On the Paris Bourse , Alcatel shares closed 1.09 percent lower -- after big gains late last week -- at 542 francs , while Lagardere fell 1.59 percent to 154.70 with traders citing concern it may not win Thomson .
France 's new telecommunications supervisor , ART , said on Thursday that it had ordered France Telecom to review a proposal for prices it will charge future competitors for using parts of its infrastructure.We have had a meeting with all the operators yesterday .
We are waiting for a new proposal by France Telecom , ART president Jean-Michel Hubert told the body 's first news conference.The list of so-called interconnection charges will be key to both the economic viability of future entrants into the French market and to the value of France Telecom , slated for partial privatisation this spring in the biggest French market float.Prospective rivals to France Telecom must apply for licences in the first three months of this year to be ready for competition in the telecommunications market in 1998.We have been asked to submit a new proposal before the end of January , a France Telecom spokesman said.Hubert said he hoped ART ( Autorite de Regulation des Telecommunications ) would issue its opinion on a general draft decree on interconnection at the start of February.Telecommunications Minister Francois Fillon aims to publish the final decree before the end of that month.On the actual price list , Hubert said he hoped the five-member ART could take a decision as soon as possible and added it should be before the partial sale of France Telecom.He declined to be specific about what kind of changes ART wanted from France Telecom .
Other operators are demanding drastic price cuts from its original proposal.Hubert noted that there was only a small window between a price structure at which competition was impossible and another at which competition would be ridiculous.ART would take account of international comparisons , Hubert said , because he believed there would be a move to harmonise these costs internationally .
But he added that such a comparison should not be the norm for a decision.ART started its legal life on January 6 , taking over the regulatory and licensing powers which the Ministry of Telecommunications previously held.ART is independent and will also act as an arbitrator in case of disputes between operators .
Its five members -- appointed by the presidents of the republic , senate and parliament -- can not be sacked nor can they seek a new term.Hubert said that a difference with Britain 's OFTEL regulator was that ART would take collective decisions while at OFTEL the director-general had decision-making powers.Asked whether ART would make life as difficult for France Telecom as OFTEL had made for British Telecom Plc , Hubert said he expected hard and difficult talks with all operators .
French books-to-missiles conglomerate Lagardere Groupe said on Tuesday it does not expect to make a profit on its ambitious multimedia activities until 1998 , despite leading market positions in the U.S. and France.Arnaud Lagardere , the son of founder Jean-Luc Lagardere and the New York-based head of the multimedia ( Grolier ) activities , told a news conference that while the results were improving , there would still be a loss for 1996 and 1997.We will hit the break-even point during 1997 and 1998 will be the first full year that we will be above break-even , Lagardere said .
In 1996 our contribution to the group will be slightly negative but it will be an improvement over the previous year , he added.Grolier , the number two interactive encyclopaedia publisher in the U.S. behind Microsoft and owner of Hachette and Filipacchi and titels such as Elle , is the largest content contributor to America Online in the U.S.It has annual sales of some 2.5 billion french francs ( $ 448 million ) .Lagardere is also the owner of the Club Internet access provider which is number three in France behind CompuServe and AOL and has big ambitions for the Intranet market of closed web services for companies.1997 will be the year of the Intranet in Europe , Lagardere said , pointing out that while Europe was lagging behind the U.S. with only 22 percent of companies having such a service , the majority of companies was planning to start such a service.That is where the hardware people of Lagardere come in.Noel Forgeard , chairman of the Matra Defence Espace unit which is vying for state-owned Thomson-CSF , said the company would try to find investors and industrial partners for a multimedia satellite project targeted for 2005.Lagardere is already partner in the Orion satellite project and its MCNSAT service can provide high-capacity internet and multimedia transport for companies.The company is currently working on two projects , called TurboPC and West , which would turn digital television sets into stand-alone internet computers.The TurboPC project envisages that computers can receive information from a satellite through a small dish -- like the ones to be used for digital satellite television.In the first instance , the so-called return line remains terrestial via a telephone line.With West , a series of at least three satellites would allow computers to use the satellite for the return as well.Forgeard declined to speculate on the investments needed , saying these K-band satellites were not comparable to mobile telecommunication satellite projects such as IRIDIUM which plans to launch 66 low-orbit satellites and has raised $ 2.65 billion.Forgeard said Lagardere would need to find investors and telecommunications operators to participate in the project.It is far too premature to speculate about the investments needed , he said.Arnaud Lagardere added that while the project was ambitious the company would not engage in investments or take on risks that would put the group into danger .
( $ 1=5.577 French Franc ) The deal that started out as a shocking hostile takeover by the lumbering giant International Business Machines Corp of Lotus Development Corp almost 18 months ago has turned into a happy marriage , Lotus 's top executive said.It really has been a marriage made in heaven , said Jeff Papows , president of Lotus , in an interview at Lotusphere , a conference for its business partners and developers .
I think we spent the first year manically fixating on our own foxholes ... Now there is enough trust established .
Papows said that IBM kept its promise to leave Lotus alone and that IBM tried hard to make the deal work .
The two companies gradually began to trust each other and the synergies between them have emerged slowly but surely.After an initial flurry of employee exits when Lotus reluctantly agreed to be acquired by IBM for $ 3.5 billion in June 1995 , staff defections eventually stabilized to a normal industry attrition rate .
Lotus 's worst fear -- that most of its intellectual capital , its employees , would quit -- was not realized .
There are more disastrous mergers in this business , Papows said .
I do n't think anyone would have predicted this would go as well as it has.The Technology sector has been fraught with mergers gone awry , such as AT & amp ; T Corp 's purchase of NCR Corp , which it just spun out again as a separate unit .
And IBM had its own unsuccessful deal , when it purchased Rolm Corp in the 1980s.IBM chairman and CEO Louis Gerstner echoed Papows 's view .
In a brief speech at Lotusphere , Gerstner also said the merger was now working , with irrefutable evidence , such as the doubling of the number of seats of Lotus Notes sold in 1996 , when the number of users reached 9.5 million.Papows said that besides IBM 's big financial pockets and its vast research laboratories , the computer giant also has an incredible global reach through its world-class sales force.And Gerstner , Papows said , has become my single best sales person .
Papows said Gerstner recently picked up the phone to speak to the CEO of Rockwell International Corp , and after he explained how important Notes was to IBM 's strategy , Rockwelll made a big investment in Notes for its corporate network.The combination of IBM 's clout and reach and Lotus 's technology will help it maintain leadership in groupware , as the turf is under siege by Netscape Communications Corp and Microsoft Corp , Papows said .
Another plus to having IBM as an owner is that the companies can work together to link corporate networks running Lotus Notes to the vast arrays of information stored in IBM mainframes and minicomputers around the world.There is a tremendous opportunity to unlock this data , Papows said .
Netscape does n't understand this .
On Wednesday , IBM and Lotus will unveil versions of the Notes Domino server for the IBM AS/400 minicomputer and the S/390 mainframe lines as part of this strategy.Domino , Lotus 's Notes server designed using Internet standards , has become Lotus 's crown jewel .
Users applauded Lotus ' move to embrace the open architecture of the Internet , after many skeptics said after IBM bought Lotus that Notes was dead because of the industry 's jump to the Web.We all heard the refrain , 'Notes is dead , ' Papows told the conference , adding that it was nothing less than masterful what Lotus has done with Notes and with Sun Microsystems Inc 's Java programming language , which is used to develop applications for the Internet that will run anywhere .
Lotus will introduce a new client version of Notes , Version 4.6 ( code-named Lookout ) in the first half of this year with a simplified user interface and seamless integration of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer and other Web products.The code name Lookout is a jab at Microsoft , which just introduced a feature called Outlook in its Office 97 suite .
Another upgrade will come in the fourth quarter with Version 5.0 , code-named Maui .
Maui will feature even more support of Internet protocols.Lotus is also working on a set of so-called applets developed in Java , including a spreadsheet , a calendar , text editor and other pieces , to run on the stripped-down networked computers .
These applications are much less code intensive , with much of the software residing on the severs that run networks .
Wall Street 's year-old love affair with IBM showed signs of fraying Wednesday after investors felt jilted by the computer maker 's fourth-quarter earnings report.International Business Machines Corp. stock tumbled $ 13 in early trading and closed $ 10 lower at $ 158 on the New York Stock Exchange , where it was the most active issue with more than 12.2 million shares changing hands.The drop contributed accounted for most of the decline of nearly 34 points in the Dow Jones industrial average , which includes IBM in its 30 stocks .
It had some market pundits wondering if the issues affecting IBM 's profits in the quarter point to a broader slowdown in corporate earnings this year that could mean an end to the stock market 's stellar rally.The world 's largest computer maker late on Tuesday said fourth quarter earnings rose 18 percent to $ 2 billion , or $ 3.93 a share , beating the average Wall Street estimate of $ 3.88 a share but falling short of more optimistic forecasts.In fact , several analysts said they were disappointed with the results , which were boosted by a lower tax rate and lower-than-expected restructuring costs , but hurt by sluggish mainframe sales and currency fluctuations.This quarter took the wind out of their sails , said Daniel Ries , a Nomura Research analyst.Rather than easily achieve ( Wall ) Street estimates , IBM appeared to be huffing and puffing , Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich said in a note to clients.IBM stock more than doubled in the last year , aided late in the year by Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh , who in November raised his price target for IBM stock to $ 195.On Wednesday Mandresh cut his 1997 earnings estimate for IBM to $ 13 a share from $ 13.40 , traders said .
Mandresh did not return calls seeking comment .
But traders said he reiterated his buy rating on the stock and the $ 195 price target.For all of 1996 , IBM earned $ 5.4 billion , or $ 10.24 a share.While IBM 's service business continued to perform well in the fourth quarter -- revenues there grew 22 percent -- mainframe sales were disappointing and its microelectronics unit was hurt by a drop in computer memory chip prices.In addition , sales of RS/6000 workstations were flat.It was disappointing in a number of dimensions , partly hardware growth and the gross margin being low , said Painewebber analyst Stephen Smith , who reiterated what he called a controversial unattractive rating on IBM.Smith said he expected less profits from mainframes , IBM 's traditional stronghold , in 1997 than in 1996.John Jones of Salomon Brothers said mainframe sales fell 12 percent in the quarter , with 10 percent of those revenues coming from IBM 's older less profitable machines that are being discontinued.Not every analyst saw the earnings report as negative.Hardware is the thing that was off the mark , said SoundView Financial analyst Gary Helmig , who cited some good news underneath and reiterated a buy rating on IBM.Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff said he held his attractive rating on IBM shares and kept his 1997 estimate of $ 12.75 a share unchanged.Some market analysts said the issues surrounding IBM could foreshadow problems for corporate earnings , and stock prices , down the road.One issue is the strength of the dollar , which IBM said ate into fourth quarter revenue growth by 3 percentage points.The strong dollar is something I think is going to impact earnings for many multinationals , said Edgar Peters , chief investment strategist at PanAgora Asset Management .
That 's something that has n't been talked about much before today.The strong dollar can hurt U.S. companies in two ways : profits from overseas are worth less when translated into dollars and companies have a harder time raising prices since foreign competitors have the advantage of a weaker currency.It means the pricing power of domestic corporations is hurt , said Michael Metz , chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & amp ; Co .
This foreshadows the real problem of 1997 because one of the pillars of this market has been earnings growth.The dollar , recently at its highest level in years against the German mark and Japanese yen , shows few signs of retreating.Still , some said Wednesday 's IBM sell-off was overdone.I think there was a lot of retail panic selling , Soundview 's Helmig said , referring to sales by customers of retail brokerages as opposed to institutional investors.David Takata of Gruntal & amp ; Co. raised his price target on IBM to $ 200 .
1997 looks like IBM 's year of execution , he said .
Some of Microsoft Corp. 's biggest corporate foes -- including International Business Machines Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp. -- said Tuesday they were collaborating on network computing standards that will enable their products to work together seamlessly.The companies , which also include Oracle Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. , said the standards resulting from the collaboration would allow software developers to build diverse software to connect computers via corporate networks , business-to-business networks and the Internet.They said their collaboration was open to broad industry participation.This initiative starts with four companies , but our goal is for an industry groundswell to develop , said Steve Mills , general manager of IBM Software Solutions.Microsoft , the world 's No .
1 software company , has been criticised by others in the industry and computer users for trying to extend its domination in various areas by developing software based on closed , proprietary standards.This is a particularly sensitive issue for the Internet , which for many years has operated according to so-called open standards.IBM , Oracle , Sun and Netscape said the results of their collaboration would be submitted to an industry standards group later this year .
Microsoft is part of the industry standards group as well.Each company pledged to make their next major products adhere to the standards this year.The goal of the collaboration is to have a unified approach to an Internet development architecture -- called CORBA , or common object request broker architecture -- so that software from these companies can use objects developed by others.For example , Netscape 's Communicator software will be able to access objects , or pieces of reusable code , stored in a big IBM or Oracle database.Microsoft 's stock dropped $ 1.625 to $ 98.375 on Nasdaq , while IBM dipped 12.5 cents to $ 146 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Oracle was down 25 cents at $ 35.75 , Sun Microsystems rose 50 cents to $ 31.75 and Netscape dropped $ 1.875 to $ 27.75 , all on Nasdaq .
America Online Inc. stock tumbled Friday , a day after the online computer service reported a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss and after some analysts downgraded its stock.America Online stock dropped $ 2.25 to $ 35.875 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.The world 's biggest online service Thursday reported a second-quarter loss of $ 56 million before one-time charges , or 60 cents a share , for its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31.Analysts on average had predicted a loss of 55 cents a share , according to First Call , which tracks analyst estimates.After the extraordinary items , which included a charge of $ 74.3 million related to a restructuring , America Online reported a loss of $ 154.8 million , or $ 1.64 a share.The company also took an unexpected $ 24 million charge in estimated refunds and credits for subscribers stemming from its recent network woes.The company 's switch in December to flat-rate pricing caused an unexpected upsurge in the number of subscribers and the amount of time they spent online .
That led to repeated busy signals for customers trying to log on from their personal computers , angering them and drawing attention from state attorneys general in 37 states.Under pressure from the attorneys general , the Dulles , Va.-based company agreed last month to provide refunds and usage credits.America Online has nearly 8 million subscribers.Smith Barney analyst Jonathan Cohen on Friday lowered his rating on America Online stock to underperform from neutral , saying that , excluding the charges , operating results fell below his expectations.In our view , many of America Online 's extraordinary charges during the quarter were somewhat less than extraordinary and would have been more appropriately recognised as regular operating results , Cohen said.He pointed out that America Online chose to recognise as revenues subscriber payments while at the same time treating the refund of those same payments as a non-recurring charge.Morgan Stanley analyst Mary Meeker also downgraded America Online , to outperform from buy but details of her comments were not available.Other analysts said the quarter was not a disappointment , but that they believed the stock fell because it became clear America Online will not break even until the quarter ended in June , as opposed to the third quarter ending in March , as previously hoped.They are n't going to do it because of the modems , said Nesbitt Burns analyst Abhishek Gami , who reiterated a strong buy rating .
But by doing what they are doing with the modems , they are accelerating the healing process.America Online said Thursday it will spend $ 10 million to $ 15 million to lease 50,000 modems from a computer network provider that it declined to name .
It said the move will enable it to expand its network to meet subscriber demand by April , two months ahead of schedule .
New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco said Friday that he planned to sue America Online Inc. if the company 's negotiations with prosecutors from 20 states over consumer issues broke down.Vacco told a news conference he would sue the world 's largest online service , with more than 8 million subscribers , to halt allegedly deceptive business practices and to win refunds for the company 's frustrated customers.The New York attorney general and other prosecutors or their aides from 20 states met with America Online Thursday in Chicago , either in person or via conference call , to discuss a barrage of complaints by subscribers who have experienced difficulty accessing the service from their computers.Vacco said he sent notification Thursday of New York state 's proposed litigation to America Online 's headquarters in Dulles , Va .
He said a lawsuit would allege the company engaged in deceptive sales practices , false advertising and fraud in selling online services.America Online , or AOL , has five business days after receving the notice .
Company officials were not immediately available to comment on a possible New York lawsuit , but late Thursday , AOL said it was cooperating with the 20 states.The online service , which enables subscribers to send electronic mail , browse the World Wide Web and view proprietary content ; has seen an upsurge in the number of subscribers -- and busy signals -- since it switched to a flat-rate , unlimited use pricing plan Dec. 1.Previously , the service had billed subscribers according to how long they were online.AOL moved to placate angry customers last week , telling them it would spend $ 350 million to upgrade its network and asking them to try to cut their use of the service during peak hours.Vacco said , We want to give the consumers a choice that gives them a refund if they want it .
Do n't just say 'Hang on ; ' give them a choice , which includes getting out with their money.I 'm not interested in contrition , I 'm interested in restitution , he said They paid for a service they are not getting.AOL already has been hit with at least four class-action lawsuits by subscribers.Vacco would not comment on what happened at Thursday 's meeting.I 'm not going to characterise it except to say ... that AOL fully appreciated where we were coming from , he said.The move to unlimited access itself incurred the ire of many of the same attorneys general .
Last month , AOL reached an agreement with 19 state attorneys general over the flat-rate pricing , with AOL agreeing to pay automatic refunds to subscribers who did not want to pay $ 19.95 a month .
America Online Inc. signed a hefty marketing pact Tuesday with little-known long-distance provider Tel-Save Holdings Inc. , immediately giving the online service a big chunk of cash and Tel-Save access to 8 million America Online subscribers.The two companies signed a deal to offer America Online members lower-cost long-distance telephone service through Tel-Save , which America Online will promote and sell to its members.America Online will get an upfront payment of $ 100 million in cash from Tel-Save , a telecommunications provider based in New Hope , Pa .
The online service will also get warrants to buy Tel-Save shares.The announcement fuelled a rally by Tel-Save stock , which climbed $ 7.375 to $ 20.50 on Nasdaq , making it one of the biggest percentage gainers on the exchange.America Online stock rose $ 1.125 to $ 36.625 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Analysts and America Online said the deal was a boost for the world 's No .
1 online service because it showed the company was able to put a big value on its growing subscriber base and that it could derive revenues from sources other than subscriber fees.This is a proof of promise , Bob Pittman , chief executive officer of AOL Networks , said in an interview .
This is not a deal a ( Web ) search engine could do because they do n't have the assets .
We have put a number on it and we have another $ 100 million in our coffers.Pittman said that while Dulles , Va.-based America Online currently has plenty of cash for its business plan , this is additional cash for general corporate purposes .
But America Online must pay the $ 100 million back.Analysts said the first $ 43 million must be paid back over 10 quarters , beginning in its fourth quarter , when America Online begins to market the Tel-Save long-distance service to its members , through pop-up screens which will ask members if they wish to enroll .
A sampling will begin this summer.Tel-Save currently offers long-distance and wireless service to about 500,000 small and medium-sized businesses .
Tel-Save said its long-distance service costs less than that from giants like AT & amp ; T Corp. , MCI Communications Inc. and Sprint Corp.These subscribers are the cream of the crop , said Dan Borislow , chief executive of Tel-Save .
This is a great use of our cash .
He declined to estimate how many America Online members may sign up for long-distance service.America Online 's warrants will allow it to buy shares of Tel-Save at prices ranging from $ 14 to $ 15.50 , for up to 12 million shares , if the total number of America Online members using Tel-Save reaches 3.5 million subscribers .
They ( AOL ) could wind up owning over a third of this company , said Jamie Kiggen , a Cowen & amp ; Co. analyst.However , some analysts pointed out that America Online will be competing against the long-distance companies , which spend billions of dollars on marketing.This will be the ultimate test of AOL 's marketing prowess , said David Simons , managing director of Digital Video Investments.It 's AOL against 'The Dime Lady , ' he added , referring to Sprint 's popular television commercials featuring actress Candice Bergen .
International Business Machines Corp. is expected to report solid fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday , but analysts expect the stronger dollar will hurt the computer giant 's profits.The Armonk , N.Y.-based company will report earnings after the stock market closes , the first time it has done so in recent memory.Wall Street analysts are predicting earnings of $ 3.13 a share to $ 4.32 per share , with a consensus of $ 3.88 a share , according to First Call , which tracks analyst estimates.A year ago , IBM earned $ 3.09 a share , or $ 1.7 billiion , including special charges , in the fourth quarter.I think it will be a good quarter , said Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Milunovich.I 'm not looking for a blowout quarter , Milunovich said , adding that the dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter and that IBM could see as much as a 25-cent-per-share negative impact on earnings from currency fluctuations.The earnings report comes amid mixed results from the computer industry for what is traditionally its biggest quarter of the year.Apple Computer Inc. reported a bigger-than-expected loss , but Sun Microsystems Inc. had stronger-than-anticipated second-quarter earnings and Digital Equipment Corp. reported a slightly better-than-expected profit in its second quarter.Analysts also expect IBM to report bigger expenses in the fourth quarter for its restructuring , which it no longer writes off as a charge .
In the third quarter , IBM had restructuring costs of about $ 200 million for employee buyouts.They will have an expense for restructuring , and it could be twice as much as the September quarter , said Dean Witter analyst Jay Stevens.Analysts said IBM 's employees in Europe have been much slower to accept its buyout plans .
John Jones , a Salomon Brothers analyst , predicts IBM will have costs of about $ 700 million in 1997 for organisational changes in Europe.Europe remains a slow grower , which has led to a number of organisational and planned efficiency changes , which we expect will require over $ 700 million in 1997 , Jones said in a report .
He said these expenses are included in his 1997 earnings estimate of $ 11.20 a share.For 1996 , analysts expect IBM to earn between $ 10.30 to $ 11.50 a share , with a consensus of $ 11.05 , according to First Call.Analysts said sales of IBM 's midrange computers , the AS/400 , should post growth of about 10 percent and that there should be a big improvement in RS/6000 workstations.IBM will host its quarterly analyst meeting and conference call sometime after its earnings are released late Tuesday.Analysts said the company was releasing its earnings after the close to avoid the recent volatility in its stock -- which has climbed or fallen as much as $ 10 on the days it reports earnings -- during its conference call with analysts.IBM stock was down $ 1 at $ 164.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
America Online Inc. 's massive refund plan , part of its effort to appease angry customers , will be offset by related cuts in its hefty marketing expenses that mgiht actually improve its near-term financial results , some analysts said Thursday.On Wednesday , the world 's largest online service -- under pressure from 36 state attorneys general -- announced a plan to give refunds and credits to subscribers fed up with repeated busy signals when they try to log on.The refund plan is part of a preliminary deal with the state prosecutors .
At least one state , New York , had threatened to sue America Online if no relief was offered to consumers.Wall Street analysts said the moves by America Online removed a cloud that has been hanging over the Dulles , Va.-based company 's stock in recent weeks.America Online 's stock Thursday rose 25 cents to $ 37.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.On Wednesday , America Online Chairman Steve Case declined to estimate how much the refunds would cost his company.Analysts said restrictions on the refunds and the requirement that customers have to request them will limit the financial impact.A lot of people can request refunds , but that does n't mean they will get them , said Jamie Kiggen , an analyst at brokerage Cowen & amp ; Co .
He estimates the refunds will cost the company $ 10 million to $ 15 million , using pretty aggressive assumptions on the number of members getting refunds.Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Oakes ' worst-case estimate for the cost of refunds was $ 16 million.America Online 's refund plan is two-pronged .
Any America Online member can request a credit of one free month online , no questions asked.But , if they want a full $ 39.90 monetary refund for December and January , based on their usage , they must have used the service for less than two hours during that time.Subscribers who were able to log on to the service for two to eight hours in December and January can request a 50 percent refund and those who were on for eight to 15 hours a 25 percent refund .
Customers who used America Online for more than 15 hours will not get a refund.Oakes said the refund expense will have no impact on his earnings estimates because it will be funded by America Online 's $ 500 million annual marketing budget.As part of the proposed settlement , America Online will not do any new advertising in February and ads already in the works will carry a disclaimer that users may have problems accessing America Online.So , as America Online cuts way back on its marketing expenses , it will hold its subscriber count at 8 million .
Abhishek Gami , a Nesbitt Burns Securities analyst , said this will assure America Online will be profitable in the quarter ended in June.Gami said America Online had been expected to return to profitability in the quarter under its new accounting measures , but said the marketing cuts now give him more confidence.It costs them a lot of money to support new users , Gami said , because new customers get the first month free.In November , America Online reported a net loss for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 of $ 353.7 million , including a charge of $ 385.2 million to defer its costs for acquiring subscribers , in a major revamp of its accounting practices.Most analysts decline to estimate how many subscribers may have left America Online or how many will leave because of its problems .
America Online 's rivals have already begun crowing about their gains in subscribers , some of whom are dissatisfied America Online users.Analysts are not unanimously bullish on America Online.They will be lucky to retain their 8 million subscribers throughout this whole fiasco , said Kate Delhagen , an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge , Mass.I think there will be a huge attrition , even with their plans to increase network capacity , she said .
...
Unless they double their network plan , there will still be a lot of unhappy people .
As the bad news continues to swirl around America Online Inc , some of its competitors are now swooping in , hoping to gain new members from the growing number of disgruntled AOL users who are fed up with its woes.On Sunday , CompuServe Corp , the second largest online service , plans to run its first-ever Super Bowl ad , a 30-second television spot , called the Busy Signal.CompuServe said it will not specifically mention AOL , but the ad is clearly a jab at AOL 's current woes , since it has been besieged with users since it switched to unlimited use .
CompuServe also plans a print campaign with the theme of reliability in accessing the Internet without frequent connectivity problems .
The company declined to say how much it is spending for the total campaign.We are doing the print compaign and the spot simply because our competitors problems have been so widely reported and so widely known , we think the public feels that all online service providers are having the same problems , said Gail Walls , an acting vice president at CompuServe .
We do n't have these problems .
Our network is our strength.Two months ago , CompuServe exited the consumer business .
When asked why CompuServe is advertising during one of the most expensive advertising time slots aimed at consumers , Walls said CompuServe is not changing its strategy.We are interested in the serious Internet customer , we are not pursuing the mass consumer , she said .
The point is to raise awareness about our strength ... When you need to make a point , it 's a great venue.CompuServe 's move comes on the heels of comments made by the head of AT & amp ; T Corp 's WorldNet Internet access service .
Late Wednesday , Tom Evslin told Reuters that AT & amp ; T is gaining new subscribers who are dissatisfied AOL members .
He also said that AT & amp ; T WorldNet plans a new advertising campaign , one that will focus more on the reliability of its network , in print , television , radio and on the Internet .
AT & amp ; T does not plan any advertising during the Super Bowl , however.This is predatory marketing .
They are in a very competitive marketplace , said Kate Delhagen , a Forrester Resarch analyst .
It 's not surprising that ( many of ) the ISPs ( Internet service providers ) are going right for the jugular .
They see consumers who are frustrated and they are capitalizing on this opportunity .
AOL is the world 's largest online service with over eight million members .
AT & amp ; T said it will not refer directly to AOL in its new advertising , which will begin sometime in February.Rather than targeting AOL users , I think we will make a point about our reliability and let people make their own conclusions , Evslin said.But Microsoft Corp , usually known for its hardball marketing tactics , is taking a kinder , gentler approach to AOL 's problems , knowing full well that AOL is not alone in the industry with outages or capacity problems .
Just Monday , AT & amp ; T said it had a 19-hour outage at WorldNet 's managed Internet service , its service for corporate users .
We do n't think it 's a healthy thing for the industry to do anything other than actions which try to expand the market , said Jeff Sanderson , general manager of marketing for the Microsoft Network , which is now the third-largest online service with over two million subscribers.The message is you should get on the Internet , and MSN is the easiest way to the coolest stuff that is there , including AOL , Sanderson said .
He said that Microsoft is doing significant marketing for MSN in general , but added that when the software giant mails out the CDs for its service , it tries to target the cities where it has the most capacity available.Meeting the unprecedented demand will be a continuing problem for the industry as a whole , said Adam Schoenfeld , a Jupiter Communications analyst .
The twist here is that Internet access in this very competitive market will not be profitable for everyone .
International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday introduced its next generation mainframe computer family , with systems twice as fast as currently available models , in a product launch widely anticipated by its customers.The feedback is phenomenal , said Ross Mauri , vice president of System 390 hardware developnment , in a phone interview .
We have seen quite a bit of demand out there.Customers have been enthusiastic about embracing the new server , Mauri said , adding that it is likely that IBM will be sold out of what we can produce this year , based on the initial customer reaction.Mainframes are giant computers that store the data of the biggest corporations around the world .
They are used by banks for transactions , by airlines for reservations systems , and by insurance companies for claims processing.While many analysts have predicted the demise of these giant computers as more companies move to PC-based networks , mainframes have staged somewhat of a comeback as huge repositories of data that is accessible via the Internet and internal networks known as intranets.The new mainframe servers use the third generation of IBM 's lower-cost processor technology , called CMOS .
The CMOS ( complementary metal oxide semiconductor ) technology is a process that uses microprocessor technology that is less costly to build and less expensive for customers to maintain.IBM introduced two new lines of System 390 servers , or computers that manage networks.One family , called the IBM S/390 Parallel Entreprise Server , has 13 models designed specifically for heavy data storage and for transaction intensive companies.The second server line , the IBM S/390 Multiprise 2000 , is aimed at medium-sized customers who are currently using IBM S/390 mainframes , but wish to increase their computing power .
The Multiprise is also aimed at customers who wish to buy an entire package , with software and storage systems.So far , IBM has installed about 14 of the S/390 Parallel Enterprise Servers - Generation 3 in an early customer programme .
IBM has also installed three of the S/390 Multiprise.IBM also said it introduced an upgrade of its mainframe operating system , called OS/390 Release 2 , which provides more connectivity for customers to computer networks such as the Internet and UNIX based systems .
IBM also introduced other software products for better network computing over the S/390.IBM also introduced new mainframe disk storage products for improved data reliabilty.IBM declined to give any price details on the new models , saying that it tailors each systems to unique customer needs and that customers are now familiar with the lower prices of CMOS-based mainframes.As you make the transition from bipolar to CMOS , you see a significant price reduction , said Mauri .
Customers already have an understanding of that.Bipolar refers to the process technology that IBM used in its older mainframe models .
Three years ago , IBM began preparing its customers for a big transition to a new , lower-cost machine , designed around microprocessors.Analysts said the new mainframes run at speeds of around 45 million instructions per second ( MIPS ) , twice as fast as the currently available speeds of 22 million instructions per second for the fastest CMOS models , bringing the systems up to the speeds of the older bipolar machines , and at a lower cost.Even with the prices of these huge milllion dollar systems falling , mainframes are still IBM 's biggest revenue producing hardware .
Analysts are hoping for a big uptick in fourth quarter earnings , in part due to mainframes , because the lower-cost models are more profitable to IBM.These are all necessary announcements for IBM , said Gary Helmig , a SoundView Financial Group analyst , adding that the products are important to IBM 's future earnings.IBM said the new models will be available next month.The mainframe as we once knew it , where MIPS were expensive , we are never going to see that again , said Sam Albert , an industry consultant in Scarsdale , N.Y. IBM has re-engineered the mainframe , they do n't even want to call it a mainframe anymore , they call it a server .
Barrick Gold Corp said on Wednesday it was now the world 's second largest gold producer , supplanting Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd.Barrick 's 1996 gold production was 3,148,801 ounces , surpassing Gold Fields ' 3,125,631 ounces for fiscal 1996 .
Barrick expects 1997 production to top three million ounces again.The Toronto-based company posted a 40 percent increase in its proven and probable reserves to 51 million ounces from 36.5 million ounces .
Barrick also reported 25 million ounces of gold in the resource category -- gold not fully proven yet.Barrick has made no secret of its ambition to become the world 's largest gold company , surpassing Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.To clinch first place , Barrick is seeking control of the huge Busang deposit in Indonesia , said to be one of this century 's most sensational gold discoveries.Two new mines will also likely carry Barrick closer to its leadership goal .
Drilling at Barrick 's Pierina property in Peru expanded reserves there to 6.5 million ounces so far , Barrick said .
The mine is expected to come into production in late 1999 at an annual rate of 500,000 ounces of gold.Drilling at Barrick 's Pascua mine in Chile bumped reserves to 10 million ounces so far , with 6.7 million ounces identified in the reserve category .
The mine is scheduled to start production of 400,000 ounces a year by the year 2000.Barrick has been negotiating with Calgary 's Bre-X Minerals Ltd for months to control the Busang discovery , but Barrick 's chances of success are up in the air.One of the messages they 'll probably try to get across is that they are not desperate for it , they certainly do n't need it , they have an awful lot already , said gold analyst Catherine Gignac with Deacon Capital in Toronto.Barrick also said today that its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings fell , due mainly to higher operating and exploration costs .
Fourth-quarter profit declined to US $ 56 million or US $ 0.15 a share from year earlier US $ 78 million or US $ 0.22 a share.Full-year earnings declined to US $ 218 million or US $ 0.60 a share from US $ 292 million or US $ 0.82 a share in 1995.Barrick was down 0.40 to 35.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in afternoon trading on Wednesday and by 3/8 to 26-1/2 in New York .
Although a Canadian federal election is not expected to be called until this weekend , the mudslinging has already begun.Reform Party leader Preston Manning , defensive after charges of racism in his right-wing opposition party , sought to turn the tables on the rival Conservatives on Thursday.The two parties face a battle for the right-wing vote .
Reform won the third most seats in its inaugural national election campaign in 1993 , while the Conservatives plummeted to two seats after nine years of rule.But Reform has been haunted by accusations of racism through its 3-1/2 year term in Parliament.Questioned by reporters on Thursday about Reform 's record on tolerance , Manning accused the Conservatives of choosing a candidate based on race.Manning produced a clipping from a Vancouver newspaper , which quoted a Conservative official as saying he deliberately sought election candidates who were not Sikh so the candidate could distinguish himself from the other parties ' Sikh candidates.If we 'd said that , we 'd be crucified , Manning told the National Press Club in Ottawa .
He urged the media to challenge the Tories on the comment , but denied he was mudslinging.I do n't like any of that stuff , he said.A Conservative spokesman brushed off Manning 's remarks as electioneering.The ruling Liberals are widely expected to call an election this weekend for June 2 .
While recent polls predicted the Liberals would retain power , pre-election campaigning has taken on a bitter flavor , with name-calling and accusations of racism and sexism becoming more frequent.Liberal Defense Minister Doug Young was criticized recently for sexist remarks .
On Tuesday , Reform member of parliament Ian McClelland called Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps a bitch in the House of Commons and was forced to withdraw his remark.Also this week , British Columbia Reform official George Rigaux resigned after saying that Sikh leaders were corrupting nominations in his riding .
Conservative leader Jean Charest said on Wednesday that voters should be alarmed about charges of racism and sexism surrounding the Reform party.The Conservative and Reform parties are trying to carve out distinct images as they compete for the conservative vote .
In trying to portray itself as a grassroots party , Reform has had to fend off a reputation for extremism.Last May , Reform members of parliament opposed a Liberal bill to expand rights for homosexuals .
One Reform member of parliament said that if he owned a business he would move black or gay employees to the back of the shop or even fire them if their presence annoyed bigoted customers.His comments were backed by another Reform member of parliament .
Both were disciplined by the Reform caucus.During the 1993 campaign , Reform had to dump a candidate after he acknowledged making anti-immigrant remarks .
Countries belonging to the World Trade Organization should be flexible and understanding about China 's bid to join the WTO , the organization 's director-general said on Saturday.As we approach the final stage of the Chinese accession process , there is a need for flexibility on all sides and a determination to resolve the crucial outstanding issues in the negotiations , Renato Ruggiero told trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum.The success of this negotiation is a shared responsibility , and it can be assured only if we keep up the momentum established earlier this year , Ruggiero said.He said substantial progress is needed on rules issues and market access.The APEC members said they wanted China and Russia to join the WTO quickly , as long as they join on commercially viable terms , officials said.The world 's major trading partners have suggested that China join last year 's international agreement to open up trade in information technology before it acceeds to the 130-member World Trade Organization.Ruggiero said that talks on financial services have become the WTO 's top priority.A success in financial services is essential to help ensure each of you -- industrialized and developing countries alike -- the necessary infrastructure growth , Ruggiero told the Asia-Pacific trade ministers.My message is : do not see this negotiation in North/South terms , he continued .
On the contrary , developing countries whatever their economic position , have an even stronger need than the industrial countries for competitive financial institutions.Ruggiero urged APEC to make sure a financial services deal is reached this year , to maintain momentum in international trade talks.Not to do so should be as unthinkable as it would be short-sighted , Ruggiero said.Last week , the United States , the European Union , Canada and Japan affirmed they would stick to the WTO schedule on financial services by putting forward their offers by mid-July.On Saturday , the 18 APEC countries affirmed their support too , building strong momentum for a deal by the end of the year in the lucrative sector , officials said.But U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned Saturday that some countries in Latin America and Asia need to be more generous with their offers .
The United States pulled out of previous attempts to broker free trade in financial services because of its disappointment in offers from other countries.The meeting between the WTO leader and the APEC trade ministers confirmed APEC 's role as a regional catalyst for action within the WTO , trade officials said.But Hong Kong expressed its concern about the WTO 's dumping code , while Korea and Japan said they were worried about an onslaught of agriculture products flooding their markets from lesser developed countries because of WTO regulations , officials said .
Bre-X Minerals Ltd 's choice today of J.P. Morgan and Co as a financial adviser completes the first step in its search for a partner to help develop its huge Indonesia gold deposit.Bre-X also said on Thursday that it hired Republic National Bank of New York as a corporate adviser.The two advisers will work together to ensure Bre-X gets the best deal possible as it picks a suitable partner , Bre-X said in a statement .
It 's setting the stage for the auction process , allowing them to be in a position to quickly and fairly assess any offers that may come in , Gordon Capital analyst Barry Allan said on Thursday.Calgary-based Bre-X sits atop one of the world 's biggest gold finds and has said it wants to sell 25 percent of the project to an experienced gold miner that can develop the site and market its product.We 've been approached by basically every major gold company in the world , a Bre-X spokesman said in a recent interview .
Bre-X also said today it hired Bryan Coates as vice-president and corporate controller .
Coates most recently worked for Cambior Inc and brings 15 years of experience in international gold mining to Bre-X , the company said.The gold mining community has been holding its breath for months , waiting for Bre-X to open up bidding for its prized Busang deposit.The choice of J.P. Morgan reflects that this is going to be a large international process , analyst Allan said .
The decision on a financial adviser is the first of a slew of announcements expected this month from Bre-X that could drive the stock.A contract of work from the Indonesian government is expected in the coming weeks .
The contract will outline environmental , social , tax and financial obligations for Bre-X and its Indonesian partner.Although details of the draft contract of work are already public , some observers fear the government may try to grab a bigger share of the profits as it sees the deposit blossom .
New drilling results are expected to hit the market within a couple of weeks , Bre-X said.The contract of work and the drilling results will likely send the stock higher , analysts said.So far , drilling at the Busang deposit has outlined 46.92 million ounces of gold .
The next set of results should bump up the deposit to more than 50 million , analysts said.I 've made the joke that everybody who goes to the property tends to see God , Gordon Capital analyst Allan said just days after returning from an analysts ' trip to the site .
And I guess I did .
There 's every probability it will be one of the largest in the world.The mine should be low cost , especially in the first few years , said Allan , forecasting operation costs at about US $ 150 an ounce.He has set a target of 35 for the stock , in the middle of the 30 to 40 range set by most analysts after the most recent tour and a previous tour in July.I continue to be really impressed by the deposit , said analyst Chris Bradbrook at Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon , who has visited the site twice .
It keeps getting bigger and bigger .
The upside is substantial.Bradbrook has a C $ 30 target for the stock for now , since investors want to see who the company 's partner will be and how the partner will develop the property before they bid up the stock.That is the biggest potential driver.But Allan said Bre-X 's options in developing the site included going it alone.They do n't want to sell too low and give up some of the upside potential , he said .
I 'm sure they 'll look at those offers and if they do n't find any that are reasonable , I suspect they will go on their own.The economics of the project are robust enough for Bre-X to finance the mine itself , he said.Bre-X was up 0.05 to 25.05 in morning trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange and rose 1/4 to 18-3/8 on Nasdaq. -- Reuters Toronto Bureau 416 941-8100 TVX Gold Inc is taking steps to join the ranks of major mining companies , bringing aboard three senior executives who pledge to turn the company into a million-ounce-a-year gold producer.We 're here to help TVX grow , said Cliff Davis , the new senior vice-president of North American operations , among three officers who joined TVX in the past month.We understand the need for organization .
We understand realistic plans .
I think that 's something we can help TVX with , Davis told Reuters in an interview .
Davis 's next plan is to speed production at the New Britannia mine in Manitoba and develop more reserves at Casa Berardi in Quebec.Joining Davis at TVX are David Murray , the recently appointed president and chief operating officer , and Ken Sangster as senior vice-president of European operations.The three have worked together before .
They did stints at mining giant RTZ-CRA Corp Plc and have years of experience with huge projects .
For us it was a perfect fit , said TVX spokesman Ed Baer .
One of the things that was a common concern to the market was our lack of management.Toronto-based TVX split off from Inco Ltd in 1993 and has concentrated on expanding its assets.With its interests now growing in Canada , Greece , Brazil , Ecuador , Chile , the Czech Republic and Russia , the company is ready to switch its focus to production , he said.TVX has promised its shareholders it will be producing 1.1 million ounces of gold a year by the year 2000 from 423,000 ounces in 1995 .
To help keep its promise , the company has placed its bets on the Kassandra Mines in Greece .
If everything works for us , the story really lies in Greece , said Baer.The property so far is expected to produce 300,000 ounces of gold a year at a cash cost of US $ 150 an ounce .
TVX was still drilling and would not have a clear idea until next spring what the deposit offered , said Baer.Uncertainty over Kassandra has unsettled TVX stock .
Its shares peaked at 14.85 in Toronto during a road show and high gold bullion prices last winter .
But the stock has since slid .
With its stock now trading around 10 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and around 7.50 on the New York Stock Exchange , TVX has been rumored as a takeover target for some major gold producers.But as a growing company , TVX is always looking for joint ventures and is on the prowl for small mining companies with proven reserves , Baer said.Davis 's first move at TVX was to shut the company 's gold mine in Montana earlier this month.The Mineral Hill mine drained money from the company for years .
TVX hoped to revive it with additional ore found at nearby Crevice Mountain , but ore grades at Mineral Hill grew worse and the company could not keep its mill supplied.Although the company continues to explore at Crevice , Davis did not hold out much hope for a resurrection of mining on the property.If it 's what it appears to be , we wo n't reopen , he said .
Statistics Canada has admitted to making a significant error in one of the ways it calculates the depth of Canada 's persistent unemployment problem.The monthly payroll report , which shows how many new jobs were registered on Canadian payrolls , was scheduled to be released on Thursday.But Statistics Canada said on Wednesday it will delay the report until May 6 so that it can correct its methods and fix inflated figures from December and January.In the course of our review of the February numbers , we discovered an error , Peter Lys , director of Statistics Canada 's labor division , said in a phone interview.He would not say how inflated the job creation figures for December and January were.It is significant , he said .
We are very sorry for what problems this has caused.The most recent payroll report showed businesses adding 9,000 new employees to their payrolls in January and 134,000 new employees in December.The error was made as Statistics Canada was fine-tuning its methodology for the survey , but the agency made changes too suddenly , Lys explained.The new data service is a definite improvement of the survey , but you ca n't just introduce it in a month or it will distort the numbers , Lys said .
It was an unfortunate human error.The payroll report sparked debate earlier this month when it became obvious there was a large discrepancy between the payroll numbers and the less optimistic job creation numbers reported in the much-watched labor force survey.During the fourth quarter of 1996 , the payroll survey showed the creation of 301,000 jobs .
But the labor force survey , which is more encompassing , showed the creation of about 86,000 jobs -- less than a third of the new jobs in the payroll survey.The discrepancy raised eyebrows in Ottawa , where job creation promises to be a major issue in a federal election campaign widely expected to be called within the week.Canada 's unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high , hovering just below 10 percent .
The rate showed its first improvement in months , when it dropped to 9.3 percent in March from 9.7 percent in February.The unemployment rate also comes from the labor force survey , but the integrity of that survey has not been questioned , economists said.The most recent labor force survey said employment grew by 60,900 jobs to 13.80 million in March .
The payroll survey has not yet been released for February or March .
( ( Reuters Ottawa Bureau 613 235-6745 ) ) The story of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and its fabulous Indonesian gold discovery deep in the jungles of Borneo has all the elements of a thriller : suspense , international intrigue , politics , legal wrangling and lots of money.The end of the story is nowhere in sight.Until this week , Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. appeared to have a deal with Bre-X sewn up .
But Placer Dome Inc. in Vancouver raised the stakes and added another twist to the plot on Tuesday by announcing that it had made an offer for Bre-X that was now under consideration by the Indonesian government.On Wednesday , another Vancouver mining concern , Teck Corp. , said it hoped to make its own bid for Bre-X and its rich Busang deposit.Busang assures any company a leading position , with its low costs and large size , said gold analyst John Ing of brokerage Maison Placements in Toronto.The Busang deposit in Kalimantan on the island of Borneo contains at least 57 million ounces of gold , worth $ 21 billion at today 's prices .
Many analysts believe the deposit could contain more than 100 million ounces of high-grade , low-cost gold.Until this week , it seemed Barrick was the only company with a realistic chance of grabbing a share of the project .
In November , the Indonesian government told Bre-X , which discovered the Busang gold find , to form a joint venture with Barrick and present their deal to the government for approval.A proposal was assembled last month and awaits the government 's blessing.But the Indonesian government 's edict spooked the international mining community and angered many Bre-X shareholders who felt their company had been forced to negotiate with a gun to its head .
Some Bre-X shareholders hired high-profile lawyers to ensure their interests were protected in any eventual deal.Meanwhile , the Barrick-Bre-X arrangement spawned rampant rumors in the mining and investment communities , prompting observers to ask why Busang deposit was not auctioned to the highest bidder , how Barrick acquired such a privileged position and who was calling the shots in hammering out a final deal.Barrick maintains it was chosen for its experience operating large gold mines , its environmental record and its strong financial position.Others cite Barrick 's alliance with the influential daughter of Indonesia 's President Suharto , and Barrick 's high-powered advisory board , which includes former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and former U.S. President George Bush.Although Barrick contends it is still the only company in the running for Bre-X , shareholders have pushed up Bre-X 's stock on the belief that Placer Dome may have a chance , analysts said.If it were a horse race , you 'd have to look at Placer , said analyst Ing.Bre-X shares rose C $ 1.10 to C $ 24.45 on Wednesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange after jumping C $ 1.90 to C $ 23.35 on Tuesday.Analysts said Indonesian officials were probably concerned about tarnishing their reputation in the international investment community and were seeking a way to allow other companies to bid on Busang without losing face.The fact that Placer Dome boldly declared its intentions in a news release , adding that it had discussed the matter with high-ranking Indonesian officials , could be a sign that the bidding process had already opened , said gold analyst Chad Williams at Research Capital in Montreal.We may be in the midst of a bidding process as we speak , a bidding process by Indonesian standards , Williams said .
I think the Indonesians appreciate how important it is to attract foreign investment , so they 're treading very carefully.For Bre-X , it is not simply a matter of waiting for word from the Indonesian government and doing what it is told.One of Bre-X 's Indonesian partners , Jusuf Merukh , this week filed a C $ 2 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) lawsuit against Bre-X , its executives and others involved in Busang .
The suit claims up to 40 percent of the Busang deposit .
Merukh already controls an undisputed 10 percent of the smallest part of Busang.We 're serious about this claim , Merukh 's lawyer Aleck Trawick told Reuters by telephone from Calgary on Wednesday .
He said Bre-X had 15 days to file a defense.Bre-X described the law suit as frivolous and said it planned a vigorous defense.Meanwhile , Bre-X is still waiting for its contract of work permits from the Indonesian government , which it needs to continue work on Busang.Most observers agree on one thing : Indonesian President Suharto and his close officials and advisers hold the key to any conclusion of the Bre-X saga.I think Placer and Barrick are waiting for some sort of signal , said Ing .
I think it 's a waiting game.While Placer Dome Chief Executive John Willson estimated this week that the saga would take three to six months to play out , some analysts believe the outcome will be clear long before that.I think things will develop very quickly from here on in , said analyst Williams .
Canada 's Federal Court ruled on Monday that immigration officials should move to deport a Saudi dissident suspected of being involved in a bombing that killed 19 U.S. airmen in Saudi Arabia last June.Federal Court Judge Donna McGillis decided that a government certificate declaring Hani Abdel-Rahim Hussein al-Sayegh a terrorist and a danger to Canada was reasonable -- despite Sayegh 's refusal to testify in the case.The court has satisfied itself that he was involved in terrorist activities , said Gaetan Blais , a spokesman for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.As a result , Sayegh will almost certainly be deported , although Canada 's immigration minister must still decide whether he will be sent to the United States or Saudi Arabia .
Sayegh can not appeal the decision.The Canadian government has accused Sayegh of being a driver involved in the massive truck bomb in Saudi Arabia last June 25 that killed 19 U.S. airmen .
The bombing , which also injured 400 people , was at the Khobar Towers , a complex housing U.S. military personnel outside Dhahran in the oil-rich eastern part of Saudi Arabia.The government also believes Sayegh is involved in the Saudi branch of Hizbollah , a fundamentalist group based in Lebanon , court documents showed .
Canada believes Hizbollah is using Canada as a safe haven.The hearing on Monday was meant to give Sayegh a chance to defend himself against the government charges .
But Sayegh surprised the court by turning down a chance to testify.His testimony in this matter was crucial , McGillis said as she handed down her ruling.Sayegh 's lawyer , Doug Baum , would not say why his client did not give his side of the story.It 's a difficult question to answer , Baum told reporters outside the courthouse .
It 's a deeply personal decision.Baum denied that his client had been advised by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.But he said Sayegh 's silence was not an admission of guilt , since the hearing was an immigration case rather than a criminal case.There were no admissions or denials , Baum said .
The issue today is not his chance to defend himself on the issue of guilt or innocence or punishment .
The issue today was admissibility to Canada.He said his hands were tied in defending Sayegh since the court shared only the summary of the government 's case with him.I think the evidence in the summary is not up to scratch , Baum said.U.S .
and Saudi officials have said they want to question Sayegh about his links to the bombing.Sayegh , 28 , was arrested in Ottawa on March 18 on the grounds that he posed a security threat to Canada .
He arrived in the country applying for refugee status from Saudi Arabia because of what he said was poor treatment of Shi'ite Moslems by the Sunni Moslem government.He has told reporters that he was in Syria at the time of the deadly bombing.Canadian government documents said that of the known conspirators in the bombing , Jaafar Chueikhat was dead , supposedly after committing suicide in a Syrian prison , Ahmed Ibrahim Ahmad al-Mughassil had been identified as the mastermind and Sayegh conducted the surveillance and drove the car directing the truck that exploded , killing the U.S. airmen .
Trade ministers from the Asia Pacific region agreed on Saturday to work toward free trade in financial services and expanding open markets for information technology.The Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum wrapped up its three-day trade ministers ' meeting in Montreal , agreeing to look for ways to expand last year 's information technology deal to include more products and more countries.In the information technology sector , there are a number of both non-tariff measures and tariff measures that we might take up and we 're hopeful that we 'll see significant progress later this year , deputy U.S. trade representative Jeff Lang told a news conference .
But Lang would not supply details on the kind of progress he hoped to see.The information technology agreement included 41 countries and 91 percent of world trade now , but Lang said four or five more countries were interested.The ministers also announced they were committed to forging a final financial services deal by December.Clearly what I 'm hearing from the 18 members of APEC is that they want it to work this time , Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton said after the final news conference .
Eggleton chaired the three-day meeting since Canada will host the APEC summit scheduled for Vancouver in November.Previous talks on an international agreement on financial services fell through last year after the United States pulled out because of its disappointment in offers from some other countries.And U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned on Saturday that some countries in Latin America and Asia need to be more generous with their offers.The United States will put forward an MFN ( most favored nation ) consistent offer , but it will be conditional on achieving a critical mass in the Asian countries and Latin America , she told reporters.Among the 18 APEC members , some of them will have progressive offers in time for the WTO deadline of mid-July , Barshefsky said.There are others who have shown reluctance .
The same with Latin America , she said .
These offers are going to have to be good , or the United States will seek an MFN exemption.Such an exemption would likely stall progress on the talks.Last month , the United States said a financial services pact must include provisions that allow firms to operate in other countries in the form of their choice .
It must also allow full majority ownership and assure existing rights of foreign financial service providers , the United States said.Chile 's Trade Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said his country would do its best to make a good financial services offer.We are prepared to make our offer and try to improve it , if it 's possible , Insulza told a news conference.The world 's major trading powers have agreed to put forward requests on financial services commerce by mid-June and offers by July 14 in the hopes of finalizing a deal by the end of December.The United States and Canada emphasized the role APEC should take in isolating certain trade sectors , liberalizing them within APEC and then putting them on to the agenda at the World Trade Organization .
APEC agreements are voluntary , while WTO deals are binding.But the lesser developed countries that form a large part of APEC 's membership appeared to place sectoral liberalization on a lower pedestal than the developed countries .
Instead , they emphasized unilateral and voluntary plans to knock down trade barriers.I think we have to emphasize that the system talks about individual action plans as well as sectoral liberalization , said Cesar Bautista , the trade minister for the Phillipines.Malaysia and Indonesia both stressed the need to help small and medium sized businesses develop trading strategies .
They said they appreciated APEC 's progress on cutting customs red tape and promoting international investment in infrastructure .
Nickel giant Inco Ltd. , after besting suitors and facing down legal challenges , said said on Wednesday that it has finally closed its C $ 4.3 billion ( $ 3.2 billion ) takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Inc.The closing gives Inco , already one of the world 's biggest nickel miners , a leading role in the nickel market for years to come with the acquisition of the massive copper-cobalt-nickel deposit in remote Voisey 's Bay , Labrador , in northeastern Canada.Diamond Fields shareholders had the choice to take common shares in Inco , cash up to a maximum of C $ 350 million ( $ 256 million ) , preferred shares in Inco or a new class of VBN shares to participate directly in the Voisey 's Bay deposit.Inco said Wednesday the full C $ 350 million was paid out .
The company also distributed a total of 50.3 million common shares , 25.9 million Inco class VBN shares and 9.4 million preferred shares as part of the acquisition.The deal ends a long takeover battle and legal saga .
Inco 's bid beat out rival Toronto-based Falconbridge Ltd. last spring.But Inco refused to sign the dotted line when , days before the scheduled closing of the deal , a group of Texans launched a lawsuit against Diamond Fields executives and Inco.The lawsuit was settled Aug. 5 , clearing the way for the deal to go through.For Inco , the deal was worth fighting for .
The Voisey 's Bay deposit is thought to be one of the largest metals discoveries in the world.The site contains an estimated reserve of about 150 million metric tons of ore and will give Inco a solid chunk of the nickel market when production starts up in 1998 or 1999.The low-cost , high-quality Voisey 's Bay project is expected to produce one-third of all new nickel mine output in the next 10 years and force some high-cost nickel projects out of business , analysts have said.Inco may still face some roadblocks before it gets to that stage , however.The nickel giant must negotiate with local native groups and win environmental approvals before it can go ahead with production .
Gail McGovern , AT & amp ; T Corp. 's new executive vice president for the consumer and small business division , is new to the big challenge facing her : boosting AT & amp ; T 's share in the consumer long-distance market.Like her boss , Chief Operating Officer John Walter , McGovern has made a reputation in a different area but will bring a fresh approach , analysts said Monday.Gail is very experienced , but her experience is on the business side , and AT & amp ; T is facing the bigger challenges on the consumer side , said Richard Klugman of brokerage PaineWebber.McGovern , 44 , was named to succeed Joseph Nacchio , who is leaving AT & amp ; T to join Qwest Communications Corp. , a small telecommunications company in Denver , as chief executive.She said in an interview Monday that her top priority would be to improve revenue growth and to retain customers.I can tell you that focusing on reducing churn will be a top priority in 1997 , she said in an interview.As the most senior woman AT & amp ; T has ever employed , McGovern will be responsible for more than half the company 's revenues.She expects to apply the same packaging of services to suit consumer customers that she has done in the business market .
A single bill for a variety of services will help show the simplicity of offerings , she said.Billing is an essential ingredient , McGovern said.AT & amp ; T , based in Basking Ridge , N.J. , has seen its market share in the $ 80-billion-a-year long-distance market dwindle from a near-monopoly when a federal judge ordered its divestiture in 1984 to around 55 percent today , according to analysts ' estimates.Apart from MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. , AT & amp ; T has recently faced competition from a host of small yet aggressive long-distance companies like LCI International Inc. and Excel Communications Inc..AT & amp ; T has been able to attract consumer customers , at a cost , but has had trouble retaining them.Analysts who have met her had little doubt McGovern would be up to the task , after winning back major corporate contracts , including IBM Corp. , McGraw-Hill Cos. Inc. and Textron Inc..She 's very bright and very quick , said Richard Toole of brokers Merrill Lynch and Co. She has fewer rough edges than Nacchio .
Joe was unique , and streetwise , but could be a little brutal , he said.Walter , who was appointed as chief operating officer in October , takes over from Robert Allen as chief executive in May at AT & amp ; T 's shareholders meeting .
McGovern 's appointment was his first visible mark on AT & amp ; T.I see his hands on this promotion , though she was a star to begin with , Toole said.In the interview , McGovern said tying in satellite TV services and other forms of marketing was a great way of reaching new markets.AT & amp ; T has a stake in Hughes Electronic Corp. 's DirecTV direct broadcast satellite venture , and in November set a deal with Shaklee Corp. under which their 500 sales representatives will talk to potential customers about AT & amp ; T services.We have to explore as many indirect sales channels as possible , McGovern said .
A number of top executives in the telecommunications industry are abandoning the comforts of giant corporations for the thrills of building a new company and the hope of becoming seriously wealthy in the process.I think this is not for everybody , said Alex Mandl , who on Monday resigned as chief operating officer of AT & amp ; T Corp. to become chairman of Associated Communications , a tiny new company in the crowded arena of wireless services.It requires a willingness to step out of the comfort zone of big Corporate America , Mandl said in an interview.New technology and a new era of competition are giving executives with key skills huge opportunities in new ventures , even as thousands of others are losing their jobs.Small companies with good technology can now beat established giants thanks to opportunities from the auction of new wireless licenses and the convergence of communications , computers and entertainment.Mandl is not the first .
In January 1995 Jim Barksdale left AT & amp ; T wireless , where he was chief executive , to become president and chief executive of the then-obscure Netscape Communications Corp..Across the technology field , start-ups have claimed Silicon Graphics Inc. President Thomas Jermoluk , Dataquest Inc. Chief Executive Judy Hamilton , Sybase Inc. Chief Operating Officer David Peterschmidt and many others.George Schmitt was chief executive of PCS PrimeCo , a national wireless venture where he had billions to spend building an advanced communications network for a group of regional Bells .
Yet in August last year he took a half-million dollar pay cut to join little-known Omnipoint Corp.What the recruiters expect is clear -- a winning market strategy , a star to attract a top management team and the use of wide industry contracts to minimize chances of failure.The companies the executives leave usually recover , but can often take some short-term damage to their stock as investors try to work out the motivation for departure.AT & amp ; T 's stock fell $ 1.375 on Monday to $ 54.125 on news of Mandl 's resignation .
It added 12.5 cents Tuesday.As well as the big names , hundreds of vice presidents and middle-ranking executives have left long-distance firms and regional Bells to work for new companies in the industry.Many have tough decisions to make , trading in long hours and a comfortable if pedestrian salary progression for a crack at serious wealth -- but with hours only workaholics would enjoy.It is the opportunity to shape something risky , but a lot more satisfying , said consultant Mark Bruneau of COBA-MID.Of course not even the big companies are so safe anymore .
Greater competition and rapidly evolving technology are erasing the comfort zone for all but a few.AT & amp ; T is cutting tens of thousands of jobs as part of its split into three parts , as are the regional Bells , who will soon be fighting head to head with AT & amp ; T in many markets.In Mandl 's case , it was an offer too good to refuse.A $ 20 million signing bonus in cash to join Associated removes any personal worries should the new company fail , and dwarfs his AT & amp ; T salary of around $ 1.3 million.Most of the other opportunities are stock rich , not cash rich like this , said Bette Massick of brokers Bear Stearns.Should Associated succeed wildly , then Mandl 's share options , which convert to an 18 percent stake in the company , should provide still greater comfort.Nevertheless , it could not have been an easy decision .
Mandl , 52 , was considered by analysts as heir apparent to AT & amp ; T Chairman Robert Allen.Mandl declined to speculate whether his decision would have been the same if Allen were to retire this year instead of in three or four years.He ( Allen ) was always consistent that I was a good candidate to succeed him , but beyond that you have to earn your stripes , Mandl said.Netscape 's Barksdale is pure inspiration for risk takers.Barksdale had a terrific job at AT & amp ; T. He could have been a candidate for the top job , Mandl said.But now even Robert Allen must dream about being as wealthy as Barksdale.Netscape , a dominant force in the world of Web browsers for the Internet , was a roaring success after its initial public offering a year ago .
Barksdale has sold 2.2 million Netscape shares , but his remaining six million shares are now worth a cool $ 222 million .
AT & amp ; T Corp shares were savaged on Monday as growing worries about marketing and investment costs in the hyper-competitive U.S. telecom market were reflected in earnings estimate cuts by two brokerages.AT & amp ; T shares plunged 2-3/4 or 6.6 percent to 38-3/4 by late-afternoon , after Salomon Bros. and CS First Boston issued their research .
MCI Communications Corp fell 7/8 to 33 and Sprint Corp 1/2 to 39-1/2 in sympathy .
It is in AT & amp ; T 's court , said analyst Barry Sine of SBC Warburg .
The more they spend on marketing their new services for the long term , the lower 1997 's results will be , he said.The market was particularly spooked by a sharp cut in his estimate of AT & amp ; T 's 1997 earnings per share by Salomon analyst Jack Grubman to $ 3.00 from $ 3.60 , and to $ 3.25 from $ 3.80 for 1998 .
Grubman later said his estimates may still be too high.Most analysts thought this too bearish a view .
Frank Governali of CS First Boston said he only cut his estimate of AT & amp ; T 's earnings to between $ 3.25 and $ 3.45 for 1997.Salomon 's number is for a dire outcome , he said .
I would be shocked if AT & amp ; T diluted its 1997 earnings down to $ 3.00 per share , said Richard Klugman of PaineWebber.First Call 's analyst consensus for AT & amp ; T earnings per share in 1997 is $ 3.68 and for 1998 $ 3.98 per share .
For the fourth quarter 1996 it is $ 0.80 and the 1996 year $ 3.48.AT & amp ; T declined to comment on the estimate cuts , but a source close to the company said no guidance had come out of the investor relations department to drive them.We have not yet determined what 1997 will bring , but it is safe to say we do not agree with the more pessimistic comments , the source said , declining identification .
Governali said that AT & amp ; T had a choice to make : Either to run the business for 1997 , in which case they could make $ 3.60 per share , or to position itself for the long-term , in which case there is no way they can.Analysts say the whole industry faces the same dilemma.The Telecommunications Act of 1996 will release the regional Bells into the long distance market place this year , on top of a horde of tiny rivals that have been nibbling away at the customers of the big three .
Though AT & amp ; T , MCI and Sprint can enter the local phone market , they will have to stump up hundreds of millions of dollars to to advertise their services , push their brand names and build network facilities to key business customers.Grubman 's research note said that he believed AT & amp ; T was losing hundreds of millions on its popular Worldnet Internet access service too , because of high costs.Analysts say MCI and Sprint have already bitten the bullet by warning analysts of increased spending , but AT & amp ; T had not done so .
Sprint and MCI have already done it .
MCI 's merger with British Telecommunications Plc is a tacit admission of that fact ( that you need very deep pockets to succeed ) , Governali said.SBC Warburg 's Sine said MCI told analysts it would spend an extra $ 200 million to $ 300 million this year on marketing , but the stock was not hit because it is underwritten by the value of the planned British Telecom merger , announced in November .
-- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610 Cable & amp ; Wireless Plc ( C & amp ; W ) and the merging NYNEX Corp and Bell Atlantic Corp have one alliance already , a second is on the way , and by late 1997 they could go as far as a full merger.Given the U.K. cable alliance I think there is all the more reason that they will be eventual merger partners , said one investment banker , who declined to be identified.C & amp ; W this month said it would merge its U.K. Mercury unit with three cable TV and telephone operators , including NYNEX CableComms Group , of which NYNEX owns 67 percent .
Sources close to the companies and investment bankers say this is a slow-moving and tentative embrace , with hurdles that could stop it before full merger.NYNEX 's merger into Bell Atlantic will not be completed until the first quarter of 1997 , and worries over C & amp ; W 's assets in Hong Kong will mean waiting to see how the handover to China goes in 1997 .
No firm decisions are likely before.However investment bankers say a desire to merge is there , noting the experience of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc ( BT ) which pulled together an alliance into a full merger .
C & amp ; W and NYNEX share some common visions and some common friendships , said one industry source close to the firms.And all the things that frustrate people about loose alliances are true .
But C & amp ; W is a large and far-flung empire , and there are plenty of ( problem ) issues , he said.None of the three companies involved would comment. -- C & amp ; W SEES NYNEX BEST BELL PARTNER -- However , C & amp ; W Chief Executive Richard Brown was last week quoted by the Financial Times in London as saying that talks with NYNEX had already gone beyond the U.K. cable deal .
With traffic flow and multinational accounts , NYNEX makes far more sense as a partner than any other Baby Bell , he was quoted as saying .
C & amp ; W declined to elaborate on the comments.Investment bankers say C & amp ; W is not big enough to crack open the U.S. business market alone , but has long distance circuits that the two Bells could use .
Bell Atlantic would be a stronger U.S. brand than C & amp ; W , and could funnel far more traffic onto C & amp ; W 's international network.C & amp ; W is strong in Asia , where NYNEX 's 13.5 percent TelecomAsia investment and Bell Atlantic 's 24.8 percent stake in Telecom Corp of New Zealand could gain new outlets .
Bell Atlantic Chief Executive Raymond Smith , eyeing the fat margins on international calling , has left analysts in no doubt of his aim of turning the regional Bell from a powerhouse in the northeast of the U.S. into a global company.NYNEX Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg , who takes over as Bell Atlantic CEO a year after the merger is completed in the first quarter of 1997 , can help him do that. -- NYNEX AND C & amp ; W SEEN CLOSE TO UNDERSEA CABLE ALLIANCE -- Seidenberg is a close friend of C & amp ; W 's Brown and bankers say the two are near to a deal on a joint submarine cable firm combining NYNEX 's Asian cable FLAG with a transatlantic cable owned by C & amp ; W and MFS Communications Co Inc. MFS is itself being taken over by WorldCom Inc , the fourth largest U.S. long distance company.Bankers say the new Bell Atlantic would be most attractive to C & amp ; W , but C & amp ; W 's international reach may attract interest from BellSouth Corp or GTE Corp too. -- C & amp ; W ONLY INTERNATIONAL CANDIDATE LEFT FOR BELLS -- Bankers say C & amp ; W is almost the only candidate for any U.S. local phone company hoping to create a company equal in global scale and reach to a merged MCI and BT.Long distance carriers have moved faster .
AT & amp ; T Corp has its Unisource alliance with Dutch , Swedish , Spanish and Swiss carriers , while Sprint Corp has its Global One alliance with Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom .
Japan 's NTT Corp , so far unallied , is being heavily wooed by BT/MCI according to sources in those firms.C & amp ; W is still available for a good reason .
It has a bewilderingly complex structure that makes it both hard to value and expensive to buy .
BT discovered this to its cost , abandoning talks on buying C & amp ; W in May this year.C & amp ; W 's activities include the Mercury phone network and Mercury One 2 One mobile phone operator in Britain , and Mannesmann Mobilfunk and Vebakom in Germany .
Many of these are joint ventures , which would complicate a change of ownership. -- HONGKONG TELECOM IS THE BIG PRIZE , BUT BIGGEST PROBLEM -- The biggest problem concerns C & amp ; W 's crown jewel , its 57.5 percent stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. Any bidder for C & amp ; W must make an offer for the Hong Kong Telecom minority .
The total cost of a bid including this could easily top $ 30 billion , analysts say .
Bell Atlantic and NYNEX have a pro forma market capitalization of $ 47 billion.The real wild card is how to value C & amp ; W going into 1997 given the Hong Kong Telecom stake , an investment banker said.China 's resumes sovereignty in Hong Kong from Britain next June , and worries persist on how Communist Beijing will handle this and other companies in the territory .
One rumored deal is that China 's ministry of Post and Telecoms would take a stake in Hongkong Telecom ahead of the transition.There are some options to bypass the complexities.A loose alliance between C & amp ; W and the two Bells would be easy to construct , but would suffer the same disadvantages of lack of focus and turf battles described by BT and MCI when they decided to go for a full merger.They could do an operating alliance with options to turn it into an equity alliance at a later stage , the banker said.Another option he saw would be to create an operating company containing the simpler parts of C & amp ; W in which the new Bell Atlantic would take a stake .
-- New York Newsroom 212 859 1610 BellSouth Corp on Thursday produced another set of strong earnings , with fourth quarter figures one cent above consensus , and extremely strong access line growth and cellular customer expansion.Analysts note BellSouth has done this on a lean cost base , aided by a conservative approach to expensive projects like Personal Communications Services ( PCS ) , and futuristic broadband networks.They did report a penny better than expectations , said Lind Meltzer , an analyst at UBS Securities.The company boosted earnings per share before one-off items by 12.3 percent to $ 0.64 , from $ 0.57 a year ago .
The First Call consensus was $ 0.63.I think their double digit earnings growth is sustainable , said Barry Sine , an analyst at SBC Warburg , though he was less confident that growth would continue at 12-13 percent as had been seen.Total operating revenues rose six percent to $ 5.05 billion from $ 4.76 billion in the fourth quarter and operating expenses rose 5.7 percent , excluding year ago charges.Preparing for entry into long distance and to defend the local calling market from new rivals is a challenge to costs , but BellSouth is so far doing well.Just holding the line on margins is an achievement , and they managed to expand a little , said Sine.BellSouth only bid for PCS licenses to fill in gaps of its regional cellular coverage while some other Bells banded together to build a national network.Analysts also applaud its 'wait and see ' approach to the information superhighway , which has been more broadly adopted by phone companies after technological and marketing setbacks.They have been proved right , Sine said.Access line growth over BellSouth 's huge and economically buoyant region was 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier .
This was below the third quarter 's 4.9 percent and the 5.0 of the second quarter.We 're not sure how much of this decline is secular , and how much is related to the ( second quarter strength ) from the Atlanta Olympics , Sine said.Volume growth at BellSouth did look a little weak considering they are normally at the high end of the regional Bells , Meltzer said.SBC Communications Inc and Ameritech Corp each recently reported some moderation in line growth.In Ameritech 's case this is a deliberate cut back in marketing because second lines have a long payback period , particularly when used for linking computers to the Internet which does not generate access revenues , analysts have said.BellSouth telephone operations cash expenses rose 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago.They have got some room to go on costs as they came to cost-cutting a little later than some , Sine said.BellSouth its employees per 10,000 access lines had fallen to 28.2 from 32.5 a year ago , a measure of productivity improvements.The stock closed 1-1/2 lower at 42-3/8 as the broad market fell .
( ( -- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610 ) ) MCI Communications Corp 's increased focus on high value customers has produced real results in the last quarter of 1996 , positioning the company well for the impending market fight with regional Bells.Normally I take strategic position shifts with a pinch of salt , but you can really see it in this quarter 's MCI numbers , said Richard Klugman of PaineWebberMCI , which reported results earlier on Tuesday , expanded long distance revenues by 10 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier , ahead of volume growth of eight percent .
This reverses the normal position for long distance companies , which have tended to get less revenue for each average minute used on their system year by year.You are seeing a favorable gap ( revenue growth minus volume growth ) , Klugman said .
Part is the price increases around Thanksgiving , but part is the data services , he said.Data services are high value services , and are not billed on a minute basis.MCI said that it had increased average revenue per customer , cut the proportion of customers leaving for other carriers and built a more effective base for the future .
We are far more selective about customers going forward , MCI Chief Financial Offier Doug maine told Reuters.To push this process along MCI is aligning the pay of its sales people with the overall value rather than number of customers .
The start of MCI One , a package of services on one bill , has helped that process , he said.They did what they said they would do and increased the focus in the long distance business on higher value customers , said Barry Sine , an analyst at SBC Warburg.Analysts are expecting a substantial increase in MCI 's spending this year for marketing the expansion into local calling .
MCI is sticking with its guidance to analysts to expect flat earnings per share for the year , they said.MCI is in the process of merging with British Telecommunications Plc .
MCI stock was 1/4 firmer at 34-5/8 by midsession .
( ( -- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610 ) ) SBC Communications Inc said on Tuesday that soaring demand for wireless services is beating its expectations and shows no signs of slowing down in 1997.I 'm amazed by how much momentum we have .
Frankly its in advance of our business plans , and its due to both the healthy economy and an overall exploding telecom marketplace , SBC Chief Financial Officer Don Kiernan told Reuters.SBC 's U.S. wireless user base jumped by 20.2 percent to 4.4 million during 1996 , with 739,000 customers added compared with an internal forecast of 600,000-650,000.The company was a cent below First Call 's analyst consensus with earnings per share of $ 0.90 for the fourth quarter compared with $ 0.83 a year earlier , though Kiernan said the miss was less once rounding errors were discounted.SBC shares , which lost as much as 1/2 immediately after the results , were unchanged at $ 52-3/4 at 1500 EST/2000 GMT.Wireless is providing SBC with new outlets for services like caller ID and voice dialling , which gives and extra kick to revenues in a fast growing marketplace , Kiernan said.During 1996 1.9 million SBC wireless customers took cellular long distance , 42.5 percent of the total , which generated $ 60 million extra in revenues.As wireless customers realise its not that much more expensive to use a cellular phone to make a long distance call we could get a real windfall ... , Kiernan said.On top of this services such as Caller ID are a big boost to revenues and profits , first because they cost almost nothing to provide to each marginal user and because they help retain customers who might switch between providers.Revenue per customer in wireless is down only 1.5 percent from the prior year , Kiernan said .
Wireless companies have come to expect bigger falls in average revenue per user as falling prices enable casual users to take a mobile phone.Traditionally , wireless providers cope by switching to cheaper methods of acquiring new customers through retailers or resellers to offset marginal revenue declines.But Kiernan said value-added services help support the wireless revenue curve , even as costs decline.Already SBC reaped over $ 1 billion in revenues in 1996 from value-added services , mostly on the wired network.In wired networks a new generation of software-based features would be available in mid-1997 using advanced intelligent networks ( AIN ) , Kiernan said.AIN means a phone or data network carries plenty of its own computing power and more information about a call than existing networks.Desktop video conferencing is available already , but others will include call management based on information extracted from caller-ID records .
Eventually many of the new features will migrate to the wireless network too.Kiernan said that SBC had just last week started selling a package of local and long distance calling , plus local and long distance wireless under the Cellular One brand in New York state.We will be rolling that out in our other out-of-region markets in Chicago , Washington/Baltimore , Boston during 1997 , so that will further buoy up average revenue per customer , he said .
( ( -- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610 ) ) Teleport Communications Group Inc is looking to buy Internet and long distance telephone service companies that add extra value to its networks or help sustain its 50 percent annual revenue growth target.We 're constantly analyzing the correct time to do that ( make acquisitions ) , chief executive Robert Annunziata said in an interview on Wednesday.Acquisitions would push a higher-value mix of services through its networks , reach new urban residential customers , and perhaps add to its burgeoning long distance networks .
Our goal and our strategy are three things .
To grow our existing markets , to grow our new markets , and to grow new products and services , Annunziata told Reuters.Teleport provides local communications to businesses in major cities , competing with regional Bells .
It is launching new networks in eight cities in 1997 for a total of 57.Teleport is majority-owned by a group of cable TV companies .
Tele-Communications Inc has 31.1 percent , Cox Communications Inc has 24.4 , Comcast Corp has 16.0 , and U S West Media Group 's Continental Cablevision Inc has 11.0 percent .
Continental Cablevision has to divest its stake by mid-1998 , beginning with a one percent stake by June.The remaining shares have publicly traded since an initial offering last June .
The company expects to raise more cash by 1998.He declined to say whether an acquisition was imminent , but if the company made one , or accelerated its investment plans , it may seek stock or debt financing earlier , he said .
Annunziata expects Teleport to break even on net earnings in about seven years , but said heavy build-out costs mean the firm is best valued on operating cash flow -- earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) .Teleport already has had three EBITDA-positive quarters , and expects to remain that way as growth continues.Nobody else competing with the RBOCs ( regional Bells ) is EBITDA positive ... we expect to stay EBITDA positive as we grow our company , he said .
The Staten Island , N.Y.-based firm expects to exceed a 40 percent operating cash flow profit margin in each of its city networks , which generally cost $ 5- $ 10 million to build .
Total capital costs are expected to continue at $ 450 million a year.Annunziata said that he expected the 50 percent annual revenue growth target to remain achievable.For the next few years that is our target and our plan .
It gets to be a bigger challenge every year as the numbers get bigger , he said , noting that acquisitions could contribute to the target .
Some analysts see the company itself as a takeover target , in the wake of WorldCom Inc 's $ 14 billion acquisition in August of MFS Communications , the other big competitive local exchange carrier.Investor attention has been drawn to the value of owning local networks , rather than having to resell regional Bell connections , which not only makes for a fast market entry but , in Annunziata 's view , eases the sale of extra services too.The only way you can capitalize on and control your client base is by owning the facility that connects to the customer , he said.Much would depend on the attitude of the cash-strapped cable TV shareholders , some of which have distanced themselves from the telecommunications market in recent months.There is always the issue that they may want to monetize that asset ... ( but ) they have a very good investment here , Annunziata said.Teleport shares have roughly doubled since its IPO .
On Wednesday afternoon they stood 1/2 higher at 32-1/4 on Nasdaq .
( ( -- New York newsroom 212-859-1610 .
) ) Global One says its shareholders are pleased the venture was able to establish itself in a tough market in year one and are not judging it by its losses in 1996.Global One was set up in January 1995 by Sprint Corp , Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom to provide global telecom services to multinational firms and carry other telecom firms .
They are very pleased they could establish Global One as a strong global carrier in year one , said Klaus Czerwinski , vice president of corporate communications at Global One.Sources close to Global One told Reuters last week the venture had lost almost $ 370 million in 1996 , when only $ 250 million had been expected.Czerwinski declined to say how much Global One had lost in total during 1996 , saying no figure would be finalised until the venture closes its books , probably in the next two weeks , and even then would not be made public .
All I can say is that we did have losses in 1996 , he told Reuters.Sprint took $ 62 million in charges for Global One losses in 1996 , $ 22.1 million of it in the fourth quarter when some earlier spending decisions had to be trued-up , or reconciled with actual outlays.The long distance carrier owns a third of the European part of Global One and half the non-European part .
The European carriers each own a third of the European operation and a quarter of the non-European operation .
Sources close to Global One last week said that unexpectedly higher losses had led to threats of job cuts , but Czerwinski was not aware of any being planned.The clear truth is that there are no decisions yet , he said.Asked about the shareholders reactions to overall cost levels he said : There are things they are more happy with and things they are less happy with ... .But they do not judge us in year one.Sources close to Sprint said on Tuesday the complexities of contributing operations from three different corporations from different accounting and linguistic backgrounds would make it hard to control first year costs.There are certain things you can only find out at the end of the year , the source said , declining to be identified.However , these are no expected to be persistent problems the source said .
( ( -- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610 ) ) Fourth quarter results so far from the regional Bells show a breathless increase in demand across the U.S. for additional lines , wireless phones and services like caller ID .
There are no signs of it slowing.Analysts said results on Tuesday from Bell Atlantic Corp , NYNEX Corp and SBC Communications Inc generally met aggressive market expectations.These companies have clearly raised the bar on expectations for demand growth .
It should be sustainable for 1997 , said Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber.However , the share prices of the group continue to reflect investors worries about looming competition in the Bell 's core local markets and how well they will do in long distance.The big issue is competition and when does that have an impact , Klugman said .
In the meantime , booming demand continues to show up at the Bells ' bottom line.Both Bell Atlantic and NYNEX reported better expected than results compared to analysts ' consensus , said Bill Vogel , an analyst at brokers Dillon Reed.SBC was a cent below the First Call consensus of $ 0.91 for the fourth quarter , but SBC chief financial officer Don Kiernan said that this was less when rounding errors were removed .
The 1996 consensus of $ 3.46 was hit dead on.Its really much closer ( to fourth quarter consensus ) than it looks , Kiernan told Reuters.Analysts were sanguine about SBC 's performance.Generally SBC met aggressive expectations for revenue .
Expenses were higher than we expected , but offset by a lower tax rate and a $ 22 million revenue boost from a regulatory change , said Bill Deatherage of brokers Bear Stearns.Deatherage said the higher expenses seem to have come from Internet and data transport initiatives , investment for long distance services and Americast.Americast is a venture with Walt Disney Co , GTE Corp , BellSouth Corp , Ameritech Corp , and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp to produce media content for interactive and multimedia networks.Klugman said that NYNEX was pulled back a little by the relative weakness of the north eastern economy , and had reined in its marketing spending as a result of service penalties.I do n't think they have had the opportunity to harvest the full benefits of the change in regulatory regime ( to price cap from rate of return ) , he said.However , Vogel noted that NYNEX had made a first.For NYNEX it was the first back-to-back years with double-digit earnings growth , he said .
( ( -- New York Newsrom 212 859 1610 ) ) French defence electronics company Thomson-CSF , soon to be sold by the state , Wednesday posted 1996 results that showed a return to profit after three years of heavy losses.Thomson-CSF reported net profit of 745 million francs ( $ 129 million ) compared with a net loss of 791 million ( $ 137 million ) for 1995 .
Sales were up 2.2 percent at 36.27 billion ( $ 6.3 billion ) .The government , after a bungled first attempt , is trying to privatise Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring that could have an impact on the entire European sector.French engineering and telecommunications giant Alcatel Alsthom has teamed up with aircraft maker Dassault Aviation and state-owned Aerospatiale to bid for Thomson-CSF .
Lagardere , involved in businesses ranging from missiles to publishing , is also bidding , supported by British Aerospace Plc.Thomson-CSF said its operating profit rose 5.6 percent to 2.07 billion francs ( $ 358 million ) despite a reduction in military budgets and tougher markets .
The improvement was due to better competitiveness following restructuring efforts pursued over a number of years.The net result was dented by an exceptional charge of 824 million francs ( $ 143 million ) , compared with 753 million ( $ 130 million ) in the prior year , to cover restructuring costs tied to the shrinking of markets and cost-cutting measures , it said.Consolidated pretax profit was 1.30 billion francs ( $ 225 million ) , versus a loss of 437 million ( $ 76 million ) , which included a 101 million franc ( $ 17.5 million ) hit from its the sale of its holding in the troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.Thomson-CSF 's previous three years ' losses were essentially due to falls in the value of Credit Lyonnais ' shares , which were taken on Thomson-CSF 's accounts to reflect its equity stake.Europe , excluding France , contributed more than 10 billion francs ( $ 1.7 billion ) in sales for the first time , compared with less than four billion ( $ 692 million ) in 1995.The European market accounts for 28 percent of the consolidated turnover , against only 10 percent at the end of the 1980s , it said , adding this was due to its policy of external growth through acquisitions.Its holding in profitable semiconductor maker SGS-Thomson contributed 588 million francs ( $ 102 million ) , up from 477 million ( $ 83 million ) in 1995.Net debt fell to 900 million ( $ 156 million ) from 2.3 billion ( $ 398 million ) .
Holding company Cie de Suez and utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux are expected Friday to announce a merger , effectively ending the independence of the company set up in the 19th century to build the Suez Canal.The boards of the two companies will meet Friday to approve terms of the link-up , which has already received the backing of the Lyonnaise board.Lyonnaise Chairman Jerome Monod said last Thursday that a combination with Suez was an excellent option , but the terms had not been fixed.The deal would mark the end of autonomy for Suez , which fell victim in the 1990s to a deeply distressed property market -- ironic since it was founded in 1858 by Ferdinand de Lesseps to build and operate the property asset that symbolised the glory of French Empire and engineering , the Suez Canal.Discontented Suez shareholders forced out the previous chairman , Gerard Worms , after the group reported a four billion franc ( $ 690 million at current rates ) loss in 1995 and installed Gerard Mestrallet to turn round the sprawling conglomerate.Mestrallet quickly sold crown jewels such as investment bank Banque Indosuez and fund manager Gartmore , as well as the ailing real estate portfolio , leaving Suez with more than five billion francs ( $ 863 million ) in cash.He held on to a 63-percent stake in Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique , which groups some choice industrial and financial assets.SGB welcomed Suez as a white knight in the late 1980s , when it was being stalked by Italian businessman Carlo de Benedetti , who saw it as ripe for takeover.Now it looks as if SGB could be the saviour for Suez .
Stock market analysts say that if there is any industrial logic in the merger , it lies in Mestrallet 's focus on the utilities sector and abandoning financial services.SGB has a 37 percent stake in Tractebel , which specialises in electricity , gas , water and environmental services .
It has operations in cable television , property , infrastructure and industrial installations -- areas that overlap with Lyonnaise.Lyonnaise , under veteran chairman Monod , has set its sights on international expansion in utilities but lacks the financial muscle to fund that growth .
A link-up would inject fresh capital from Suez 's cash hoard -- even after an estimated 3.4 billion franc ( $ 587 million ) payment to sweeten Suez shareholders on the merger.Monod said last week that a merged Suez/Lyonnaise would be a multi-service company on a global scale and capable of boosting profits and cashflow .
Holding company Cie de Suez and utility Lyonnaise des Eaux must tell shareholders how they will benefit from the groups ' planned merger , otherwise the deal will look like a defensive move , analysts said on Friday.The boards of Suez and Lyonnaise are expected to approve later on Friday terms of the merger which will create a group with annual sales of about 200 billion francs ( $ 35 billion ) and a market capitalisation of 75 billion.But size is not necessarily a bonus if the new group can not bring operating companies together and if Suez is not allowed to sell Belgian financial assets to shed its conglomerate status and focus on utilities.If there is no link-up between Lyonnaise and Suez , the merger makes little sense .
It looks like a defensive move , a share analyst said.Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod told Europe 1 radio on Friday that the new group would have four core businesses -- energy , water distribution , waste management and communications.What do shareholders stand to gain ?
a second analyst asked .
There is still uncertainty , he added.In the short term , Suez shareholders can look forward to a big cash payout as part of the merger terms , with a dividend estimated at around 24 francs per share , or a total of some 3.8 billion francs.They are also getting a chance to cut the discount on Suez shares compared with underlying assets -- if the new group buries Suez 's holding company image by selling financial assets to concentrate on utilities , as promised.Suez investors will also gain by getting shares in Lyonnaise , which for all its past weakness , is one of France 's biggest companies and harbours big expansion ambitions.But Suez holders still need to be convinced on big issues related to the merger.The merger is being structured as a Lyonnaise takeover of Suez , apparently to take advantage of Suez 's tax loss carry-forward , which would shelter future profits of the new group .
This needs to be clarified , said an analyst.For Lyonnaise shareholders , the deal looks more risky.They do not know if Suez chairman Gerard Mestrallet has made guarantees of management freedom to the Belgian government for the Societe Generale de Belgique holding company , which groups choice industrial and financial assets.Any commitments may inhibit SGB 's disposal of Belgian financial assets , which include stakes in banking giant Generale de Banque and insurer Fortis.French investment in Belgium has become a sensitive issue since Renault SA 's decision to close its Vilvoorde plant near Brussels at heavy cost to jobs.The Belgian authorities insist on keeping the Tractebel utilities company , 50.3 percent owned by SGB , independent and headquartered in Belgium .
This may limit the scope for integrating Tractebel into Lyonnaise 's global ambitions.Howver , Tractebel could benefit from asset transfers from Lyonnaise , such as the Elyo energy subsidiary.The disposal of Suez 's French financial units such as consumer credit house Sofinco , property broker Banque Monod and insurer Henin Vie , pose less of a problem.Credit Agricole , which last year bought Banque Indosuez , has an option to buy 20 percent of Sofinco next year.Lyonnaise shareholders stand to gain an injection of fresh capital which the company needs to finance its global aspirations .
But if the Suez disposals do not go according to plan , they will be left with a conglomerate on their hands , with the accompanying discount on the shares .
( $ = 5.789 French Francs ) The French government said on Tuesday it was ready to relaunch the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF and appointed key executives to oversee the sale.The government has just taken the decisions necessary for the privatisation of Thomson-CSF to enter the operational phase , the industry and finance ministries said in a joint statement.An attempt to sell the whole Thomson electronics group last year floundered when the independent Privatisation Commission rejected the sale of parent company Thomson SA to the missiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere Groupe for a symbolic one franc.The government said on Tuesday it would make Marcel Roulet , formerly chairman of both Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF , responsible for the sale of the defence subsidiary on a full-time basis .
He will now only be chairman of Thomson-CSF.It also appointed Thierry Breton , formerly a deputy chairman of French computer maker Cie des Machines Bull , as chairman of Thomson SA and its wholly-owned consumer electronics unit , Thomson Multimedia ( TMM ) .Breton will be responsible for privatising TMM and will shortly make proposals on the sale , the statement said.First of all , it is the signal that the two things are really separate , with two different men who will exclusively work on Thomson-CSF and the handling of the privatisation of TMM , an industry ministry official said.The second signal is that , effectively , we are relaunching the TMM privatisation with a new head who will soon make proposals to the government on the procedure , he added.The government will inject 11 billion francs ( $ 1.9 billion ) of fresh capital into TMM by the summer , following approval from the European Commission.TMM , which makes television sets and video cassette recorders , will be sold gradually through an opening up of its capital , the statement said.A source close the deal said the TMM sale would follow the lines of the past Bull privatisation -- a trade sale accompanied by a list of conditions , rather than a stock market flotation.TMM would need sound finances to float on the bourse but is losing money and requires industrial partners who would take a medium-term view rather than stock market investors , who look to the short term , the source said.An industry source said the boards of Thomson SA and Thomson-CSF met on Tuesday morning to discuss the terms and conditions of Thomson-CSF 's privatisation.A key objection by the Privatisation Commission to the government 's first sale attempt was the planned sale by Lagardere of loss-making TMM to the South Korean Daewoo Electronics group , again for one symbolic franc.Lagardere wanted to retain Thomson-CSF and merge its Matra Defense Espace unit with Thomson to create an integrated defence company with radar , satellite and missile interests.The government has now decided to sell Thomson-CSF , 58 percent owned by Thomson SA , separately from TMM.Detailed terms and conditions are expected to be announced shortly , opening the way for companies to make fresh bids for Thomson-CSF .
Both Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom have said they are interested.TMM last week posted a 1996 net attributable loss of 3.1 billion francs , which included hefty provisions for factory closures and the expected loss of up to 10,000 jobs.But it expects to break even at the operating level next year and be profitable from 1999 when U.S. patent revenues come on stream.Thomson-CSF announced last week it returned to profit in 1996 after three years of losses , showing a net attributable profit of 745 million francs .
Rival bidders in the privatisation of French defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF will need to woo planes-to-missiles group Aerospatiale to stand a chance of winning the deal , analysts said.France is selling Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring which will affect state-owned Aerospatiale 's business and the government has said it will ask Aerospatiale 's chairman for his opinion about the offers.The government on Tuesday said it had ruled out Aerospatiale from bidding for Thomson-CSF either on its own or as part of a group because it is a public sector company already.A defence ministry official said on Thursday that if Aerospatiale , as a state-owned firm , had entered the bidding it would have meant the state upsetting the equitable handling of the privatisation procedure.The government , through Aerospatiale , would have been throwing its weight behind one of the bidders , he said.Engineering group Alcatel Alsthom had enlisted Aerospatiale , and family-owned Dassault Industries , in its pitch for Thomson-CSF , to rival that of books-to-missiles group Lagardere.Because Aerospatiale has close ties with Thomson-CSF on a number of programmes , it would be directly affected by the sale and the government said it would consult Aerospatiale chairman Yves Michaud on offers for Thomson-CSF.Lagardere responded to the news by asking for a formal process to gain access to financial and industrial information on Aerospatiale to allow it to mount its bid for Thomson-CSF.But an analyst at a large French brokerage said relations between Lagardere and Aerospatiale were bad and the chances of Alcatel winning Thomson-CSF had improved.The chances of Lagardere ( getting Thomson-CSF ) are less today , he said.Aerospatiale and Lagardere compete directly in the same markets and products , notably in missiles and satellites.Lagardere has long considered it and not Aerospatiale should be the French centre for a European consolidation in missiles and satellites.Lagardere has tried to persuade Daimler-Benz Aerospace ( DASA ) to merge its missiles and satellites with its own joint ventures with British companies , instead linking up with Aerospatiale.Aerospatiale said it was pleased that the government , in its role of shareholder , will consult Aerospatiale 's chairman on the parts of the offers for Thomson-CSF which will affect Aerospatiale.Alcatel Alstom declined comment.Newspaper La Tribune reported earlier this month that Alcatel , Dassault Industries and Aerospatiale had agreed a plan to carve up Thomson-CSF 's capital between them if Alcatel won the bidding.In that plan , Dassault would sell its holding in aircraft avionics firm Dassault Electronique to Thomson-CSF , and Thomson-CSF would sell its estimated four billion francs worth of missiles activities to Aerospatiale , boosting its presence in tactical missiles to better rival Lagardere 's Matra/BAe Dynamics joint venture with British Aerospace Plc .
Holding company Cie de Suez and utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux are expected on Friday to announce a merger deal , effectively ending the independence of the company set up in the 19th century to build the Suez Canal.The boards of the two companies will meet on Friday to approve terms of the link-up , which has already received the backing of the Lyonnaise board.Lyonnaise chairman Jerome Monod said last Thursday that merger with Suez was an excellent plan but the terms had not yet been fixed.The deal would mark the end of autonomy for Suez , which fell victim in the 1990s to a deeply distressed property market -- ironic since it was founded in 1858 by Ferdinand de Lesseps to build and operate the property asset which symbolised the glory of French Empire and engineering , the Suez Canal.Discontented Suez shareholders forced out the previous chairman , Gerard Worms , after the group reported a four billion franc ( $ 690 million at current rates ) loss in 1995 and installed Gerard Mestrallet to turn round the sprawling conglomerate.Mestrallet quickly sold crown jewels such as investment bank Banque Indosuez and fund manager Gartmore and the ailing real estate portfolio was disposed of , leaving Suez with more than five billion francs in cash.But he held on to a 63-percent stake in Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique , which groups some choice industrial and financial assets.SGB welcomed Suez as a white knight in the late 1980s when it was being stalked by Italian businessman Carlo de Benedetti , who saw it as ripe for takeover.Now it looks as if SGB could be the saviour for Suez .
Stock market analysts say that if there is any industrial logic in the merger , it lies in Mestrallet 's focus on the utilities sector and abandoning financial services.SGB has a 37 percent stake in Tractebel , which specialises in electricity , gas , water and environmental services.It has operations in cable television , property , infrastructure and industrial installations -- areas which overlap with Lyonnaise.Lyonnaise , under veteran chairman Monod , has set its sights on international expansion in utilities but lacks the financial muscle to fund that growth.So a link-up would inject fresh capital from Suez 's cash hoard -- even after an estimated 3.4 billion franc payment to sweeten Suez shareholders on the merger.Monod said last week that a merged Suez/Lyonnaise would be a multi-service company on a global scale and capable of boosting profits and cashflow .
( $ = 5.797 French Francs ) France 's second rebuff in a week to British group General Electric Co Plc ( GEC ) -- this time over nuclear merger talks -- underscores its concerns over controlling strategic industries , analysts say.State-controlled nuclear engineering firm Framatome said on Monday its main shareholders had told it that a mooted merger between Framatome and Anglo-French joint venture GEC Alsthom was unlikely.GEC , an engineering and electronics company , had wanted 50 percent of the new group but that this was contrary to the French government 's wishes , it said.Framatome 's statement follows Friday 's refusal by the French government to allow GEC to bid in the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF -- again because the state was not prepared to sell a half share to a foreign firm.It 's about control , said one restructuring specialist who declined to be identified.Concerns over industrial leadership are a common thread in the French government 's thinking , while British managers are seeking to improve shareholder returns , analysts said.Majority ownership of at least 51 percent is the least the French government seems willing to contemplate in strategic sectors , analysts said .
But even where ownership is split 50-50 -- as in the GEC Alsthom engineering group -- the French still effectively held control , the restructuring expert said.Strategically the U.K. companies , on behalf of their shareholders , are saying 'We ca n't justfify any more 49s or 50/50s that do n't have some element of operational control , because we do n't think shareholder returns are actually maximised in that way , he said.GEC Alsthom is jointly owned by GEC and Alcatel Alsthom .
It makes power generating plants and France 's high-speed TGV trains , and had been in talks to merge with Framatome .
Alcatel owns 44 percent of Framatome directly.France , whose first attempt to privatise the Thomson parent company collapsed last year when a South Korean company 's involvement failed to get past the privatisation watchdog , raised the issue of foreign ownership again on Friday when it rejected a bid by GEC.French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis insisted on Saturday that Paris was open to foreign firms taking part in French bids for the state 's 58 percent in Thomson-CSF .
The government is ready to examine offers which include partnerships , he said.He indicated that a foreign partnership would help France 's ambition to create a big European defence company strong enough to rival the U.S. titans.But analysts say France , while wanting a European defence restructuring , is determined to stay in the pilot 's seat.The government says Alcatel and missiles-to-publishing firm Lagardere are eligible to bid for Thomson-CSF and is encouraging GEC to talk to them as they prepare final offers.An investment banker close to the Thomson-CSF sale said the British business approach was essentially pragmatic and driven by bottom-line considerations.It was not inconceivable , given weak margins and the strength of GEC Alsthom 's competitors , that GEC could one day sell its share in the joint venture to Alcatel , the banker said.GEC Alsthom competes with the likes of U.S. General Electric Co , the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri joint venture and Siemens AG of Germany .
France said on Friday it would not allow Britain 's General Electric Co Plc ( GEC ) to bid for the state 's stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF for national security reasons.GEC said it regretted the rejection but indicated it had not given up , saying it was talking to two French groups which are allowed to bid -- missiles-to-publishing group Lagardere Groupe and Alcatel Alsthom , an electronics and engineering company.The Finance Ministry said it had received offers for the 58 percent stake from Lagardere and Alcatel , which is bidding with defence company Dassault Industrie.The government has declared as admissable the proposals by Lagardere Groupe and the one by Alcatel Alsthom and Dassault Industrie , the Ministry said in a statement.However , because the sale to a foreign company of more than 50 percent of the share capital of Thomson-CSF goes against the interests of national security , the proposal by GEC has not been admitted , it added.Industry Minister Franck Borotra told French television that GEC could still play a role in the Thonson-CSF privatisation if it found common ground with either of the French bidders.GEC , which believes it can play an important role in this restructuring , has to approach the two candidates which have been admitted to see what kind of agreement , what kind of negotiations can take place about the place they can have in the restructuring of the European defence industry around Thomson-CSF , Borotra told LCI television in an interview.London analysts say it was never likely GEC would be allowed to win the tender over French companies .
But they say it might yet gain a stake by teaming up with a French partner.GEC said it had bid for Thomson because it believed it could be brought together with GEC-Marconi to create a world leader in defence electronics and enable Europe to compete better with U.S. companies.The fragmented structure of the European defence electronics industry will not sustain a strong competitive position in world markets in the next century , it said.This can be achieved only through an integrated electronics defence capability efficient in its operations and effective in the deployment of its resources , GEC said.In Paris , the ministry said the government had encouraged the accepted candidates to set out their plans for French and European industrial partnerships when they submitted final offers for Thomson-CSF.Firm offers are due by May 7 and the government hopes to make a decision by the end of June.Last year , Lagardere and its South Korean ally Daewoo Electronics won the bidding for Thomson-CSF 's then parent , Thomson SA , beating Alcatel.Thomson SA held the state stake in Thomson-CSF and all of consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia ( TMM ) .But the government suspended the deal in December after the independent Privatisation Commission objected to the terms of TMM 's sale to Daewoo .
French defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF , soon to be sold by the state , posted 1996 results on Wednesday showing a return to profit after three years of heavy losses.Thomson-CSF reported a net attributable profit of 745 million francs ( $ 129 million ) compared with a net loss of 791 million for 1995 .
Sales were up 2.2 percent at 36.27 billion.The return to the black was mainly due to the sale of Thomson-CSF 's 19 percent stake in the troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.Thomson-CSF has been able to return to a profitable footing , as the bank no longer weighs on the accounts of the company , which is now completely centred on defence electronics , chairman Marcel Roulet told an analysts ' meeting.The state , after a bungled first attempt , is trying to privatise Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring which may have an impact on the entire European sector.Roulet said he expected the terms and conditions drawn up by the government on the privatisation would be published soon .
It is a question of a few days or a week .
The Privatisation Commission has to vet the terms to allow the sale to go ahead.French engineering and telecommunications giant Alcatel Alsthom has teamed up with fighter-aircraft maker Dassault Aviation and state-owned Aerospatiale to bid for Thomson-CSF.Missiles-to-publishing group Lagardere is also bidding , supported by British Aerospace Plc ( BAe ) .Thomson-CSF said in a statement that operating profit rose 5.6 percent to 2.07 billion francs despite a reduction in military budgets and tougher markets .
The improvement was due to better competitiveness following restructuring efforts pursued over a number of years.The net result was dented by an exceptional charge of 824 million francs , compared with 753 million in the prior year , to cover restructuring costs tied to the shrinking of markets and cost-cutting measures , it said.Pre-tax pre-exceptional profit rose 12 percent to 2.04 billion francs , reflecting the productivity gains and lower financial charges .
Financial costs fell to 27 million francs from 135 million , due to lower interest rates and favourable currency movements.Consolidated pretax profit was 1.30 billion francs , versus a loss of 437 million , which included a 101 million franc hit from its the sale of its holding in Credit Lyonnais.The previous three years ' losses at Thomson-CSF were essentially due to falls in the value of Credit Lyonnais shares , which were taken on Thomson-CSF 's accounts to reflect its equity stake .
European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie on Friday attacked as anti-competitive a deal under which the U.S. airline Delta will buy new aircraft exclusively from its archrival Boeing for the next quarter century.Delta Air Lines Inc said on Thursday it had named Boeing Co as its sole aircraft supplier for the next 25 years , as it announced a $ 6.7 billion order for 106 Boeing aircraft .
Options would bring the total to 644 aircraft.The Delta deal , potentially worth more than $ 15 billion , follows a similar exclusive deal between Boeing and AMR Corp 's American Airlines.We are not afraid of competition , we can sell our planes on their own merits , said an Airbus spokeswoman .
She said Boeing was trying to buy out the competition with exclusive deals which lock an airline into a long-term commitment.It 's destroying competition in the long term , she said.Such deals could be bad for airlines and passengers if Boeing , which is already in a dominant position globally , forced out Airbus and gave the U.S. manufacturer room to raise prices , she said.If Airbus is forced out of the market , prices would go up , which is not in the interests of the public.Asked if Airbus was planning an anti-trust action on the Delta deal , she said : If we were asked by any of the official instances ( authorities ) , we will of course be ready to talk to them.Boeing , which has around 60 percent of the world civil aircraft market , is merging with McDonnell Douglas which has around 10 percent .
The merged group would have annual sales of $ 48 billion.That merger plan is being investigated by the European CommissionDelta 's deal with Boeing will allow it to streamline its fleet , reduce maintenance and training costs and retire older planes to lower operating costs.American Airlines said last November it would buy planes solely from Boeing to 2018 .
It ordered 103 jets and took options on more than 500 in a deal that could be worth well over $ 30 billion.Airbus , which ad 1996 sales of $ 8.8 billion , is a consortium of four European companies that are in talks to convert it from a partnership into a limited liability company by 1999.The four partners are French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale , British Aerospace Plc , Daimler-Benz Aerospace , a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA ( CASA ) of Spain .
CSX Corp 's sweetened bid for Conrail Inc makes the deal more appealing to Conrail shareholders than its previous offer , but it may not be strong enough to clinch the deal.Although the new terms are financially more attractive and reduce investor risk , members of the Wall Street investment community blasted a provision that prohibits either company from pursuing another partner until the end of 1998.Furthermore , rival Norfolk Southern Corp , which still has a higher offer , is expected to raise its bid .
The new pact definitely does n't lock it up because you 've got to wait for Norfolk Southern to come back .
It definitely makes it more attractive and more equitable across the board , said Peter Gleason , an analyst at Institutional Shareholder Services , an shareholder advisory firm that last week recommended investors reject a key provision of the deal.The new terms raise the previous bid by about $ 870 million by offering shareholders convertible preferred shares valued at $ 16 each .
CSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in a cash tender offer and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent .
It has proposed buying the rest of Conrail for stock .
Based on Thursday 's trading , analysts said the new terms value Conrail at about $ 104 per share , or $ 9.5 billion in cash and stock , still less than Norfolk Southern 's $ 10 billion , $ 110-per-share all-cash offer.The new terms also sets a voting trust for Conrail shareholders to guarantee speedy payment for their shares .
Under the previous offer , shareholders would not receive payment until the deal cleared regulatory hurdles.The establishment of the voting trust is likely to encourage some shareholders to tender their stock to CSX and exit the controversial transaction , experts said .
A source familiar with the talks said the CSX board decided to add another $ 16 per share to the offer and hammered out the details of the strategy Wednesday night.The source also defended the extension of the pact 's exclusivity agreement , saying that it would prevent a continued bidding war.The message to the world is , take this deal or wait an awful long time for an alternative , said the source , who did not want to be identified .
Still , Wall Street experts expect Norfolk Southern to challenge the exclusivity period in court .
An attorney for Norfolk Southern said legal action was likely forthcoming.Norfolk Southern also earlier said it expected to respond promptly to a new CSX offer.Meanwhile , Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities noted that the deal was becoming less financially attractive to the prospective buyers as the bidding war continued.We 're bumping up against the point at which this is getting pricey .
It still makes some sense , but for CSX it 's getting close , Hatch said , adding that Norfolk Southern can well afford to raise its offer.By 1430 EST/1930 GMT Thursday , shares of Conrail were 1-1/2 higher at 100-1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange , amid expectations that Norfolk Southern would raise the stakes in the battle .
ITT Corp. met with financial advisers on Thursday to assess an unsolicited $ 6.5 billion bid from Hilton Hotels Corp. , while some Wall Street analysts said the company 's best defence might be to pursue an acquisition.Industry experts said ITT might be able to stave off the takeover if it made a large casino or hotel purchase.ITT is a company with a lot of friends on Wall Street and a lot of investment bankers and there are a lot of players in the gaming industry who would like to trade up to a higher quality , said Thomas Ryan of Bankers Trust.Although ITT is widely expected to reject the offer , sources close to the company said no decision had been made and no acquisition talks were being held .
ITT 's board will consider the bid at a regularly-scheduled board meeting next Tuesday.ITT declined to comment.On Monday , Hilton offered to buy ITT in a stock and cash transaction that values the company at $ 55 per share .
The offer also includes the assumption of $ 4 billion in debt.The stock of New York-based ITT , which soared most of the week on views Hilton would be forced to raise the bid , fell 75 cents to $ 56.875.On Friday , ITT 's financial advisers are expected to pore over Hilton 's official bid documents that are to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.An acquisition certainly would be in keeping with the company 's history .
( ITT Chairman Rand Araskog ) has either got to be a buyer or he 's got to let the company go , said Gerry Shapiro , managing director at KPMG Peat Marwick.Industry experts said a sizable acquisition by ITT would thwart Hilton 's takeover plan by making the purchase price too costly .
In a telephone conference call with reporters earlier this week , Hilton Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach vowed the Beverly Hills , Calif.-based company would only pursue transactions that added to earnings.Industry experts speculated that one of the most attractive acquisition candidates would be Harrah 's Entertainment Inc. which has long been considered ripe to participate in industry consolidation.A spokesman for Harrah 's declined to comment.An acquisition would also further solidify Araskog 's role at the company he has run since 1979 .
He ran the ITT conglomerate and then took over the hotel , entertainment and gambling portion of the company when it split into three pieces in 1995.I think Rand Araskog does n't want to give up his job. , said Forum Capital Markets analyst Philip Platek , who also speculated that ITT could buy a gambling or lodging company .
Conrail Inc. on Friday spurned a sweetened $ 10.5 billion takeover offer from hostile suitor Norfolk Southern Corp. amid speculation that a 2-month-old bidding war for the railroad was drawing to a close.As expected , Conrail rejected the offer and contended that its proposed friendly $ 9.3 billion merger with CSX Corp. would be a better corporate combination.The Conrail board has again confirmed that a merger of equals with CSX and not a sale to Norfolk Southern is in the best interests of Conrail and its constituencies , including shareholders , employees , suppliers , customers and communities served , Conrail Chairman David LeVan said in a statement.The rejection came just one day after both CSX and Norfolk Southern raised their bids for Conrail.Industry analysts said CSX and Norfolk Southern were unlikely to offer much more for the Philadelphia-based railroad , but both sides will pursue the fight in court , before regulators and in the marketplace.That is the whole process that takes place over the course of 1997 -- the battle for market share as opposed to Conrail shares , said NatWest Securities Corp. analyst Anthony Hatch.On Thursday , Richmond , Va.-based CSX raised its offer for Conrail to give shareholders an extra $ 870 million in the cash-and-stock merger .
Based on Friday 's stock activity , the deal is worth $ 9.3 billion , or about $ 102 per Conrail share.A source close to CSX told Reuters then that CSX and Conrail hoped the revised deal would end the bidding war.But just hours after CSX and Conrail unveiled the new terms of their planned merger , Norfolk Southern raised its all-cash offer by $ 500 million to about $ 10.5 billion , or $ 115 a share.If someone were to start to bid higher than this , they probably would n't get the economies out of the deal to make it work , so the bidding war , I think , has come to the end , said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group.Although Norfolk Southern 's bid has been higher throughout the two-month takeover fight , Conrail contends the union with CSX is a better strategic fit.Industry experts said Norfolk , Va.-based Norfolk Southern , which has the financial power to bid more than $ 10.5 billion , merely wants to preserve the spread between the two offers while it fights a key aspect of the Conrail-CSX pact in court.Norfolk Southern is challenging part of the transaction that prohibits either CSX or Conrail from seeking another merger partner before 1999.Norfolk Southern said in court documents that directors of Conrail had violated their duties to the company and misled shareholders by agreeing to that provision.Put simply , Conrail 's directors have agreed to take a two-year leave of absence during what may be the most critical period in Conrail 's history , Norfolk Southern said.Some analysts and investors said that if the exclusivity provision is not thrown out after a Jan. 9 hearing before a federal judge in Philadelphia , it could guarantee a victory for CSX because shareholders would not wait two years for a deal with Norfolk Southern.Norfolk Southern last month lost a court fight in which it challenged previous terms of the deal , including an exclusivity provision that ruled out other talks before July 1997.The latest court case is expected to hinge on whether Conrail 's agreeing to the extended exclusivity period falls within the broad discretion allowed a board under Pennsylvania law , said Charles Yablon , a professor of corporate law at Cardozo University in New York.They 're pushing the outside of the envelope and trying to take maximum advantage of the leeway that Pennsylvania law gives them , Yablon said .
But if they can legally justify the move , CSX will probably prevail in court , he said.Few Wall Street analysts were predicting the outcome , but the war was expected to drag on no matter which company wins in court.After the court fight , the next battle site will be Washington where the losing bidder is expected to vehemently challenge the merger .
The deal already is expected to face intense scrutiny from the Surface Transportation Board , the federal agency that oversees railroads.You 're going to have a lot of opposition to this , PNC 's Vincent said , citing railroads , shippers and state agencies which are expected to express their opinions when the transaction reaches the regulatory stage.Last week , the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it would intervene in any merger involving Conrail.Conrail stock fell 87.5 cents to $ 99.875 on the New York Stock Exchange .
CSX stock fell 50 cents to $ 43.25 and Norfolk Southern shares rose $ 1.125 to $ 89.50 , also on NYSE .
Norfolk Southern Corp may win new allies with its latest plan to thwart Conrail Inc 's planned $ 9.2 billion merger with CSX Corp , but Wall Street experts are not convinced the effort will succeed.They said the outcome of Friday 's crucial Conrail shareholder vote , already considered a tight race before Norfolk Southern disclosed its effort , is now even closer.Norfolk Southern is trying to win over any uncommitted shareholder they can find , said Thom Brown , managing director of investment firm Rutherford , Brown and Catherwood Inc. Conrail needs shareholder support in order to proceed with the planned cash and stock CSX deal .
The railroad is asking investors to waive a Pennsylvania law that would essentially require CSX to pay for Conrail in cash.Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern 's $ 10.3 billion cash bid in favor of the CSX transaction.Late Monday , Norfolk Southern launched a new attack on the Conrail-CSX deal , telling Conrail shareholders it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail shares for $ 115 each if they defeated Friday 's measure .
It might have some influence on ( the shareholders ) , but it looks to me like it may be too late .
This has been a tough battle for Norfolk Southern , Brown said.Sources close to CSX and Conrail said the vote tally is expected to take a couple of days.Our sense is that Conrail may well lose that vote ... Norfolk 's strategy here appears to be to try to build on the momentum it began by aggressively courting Conrail 's shareholders last week , wrote James Higgins of Donaldson Lufkin & amp ; Jenrette in a report issued Tuesday .
Although some analysts had speculated that the plan disclosed by Norfolk Southern could prompt Conrail to delay the shareholder meeting , the railroad earlier confirmed that the meeting will take place Friday.Norfolk Southern 's offer is higher than CSX 's , but a merger of the two railroads could not happen any time soon .
According to its pact with CSX , Conrail would be prohibited from entering a partnership with Norfolk Southern or any other party until 1999 .
Norfolk Southern challenged the exclusivity pact in court , but a federal judge last week upheld the terms of the Conrail-CSX merger.Analysts said that the latest move by Norfolk Southern is an effort to convince shareholders that it is willing to take the risk of buying a stake in Conrail even though it would be prohibited from buying the railroad for two years.I think it 's going to be very close .
This tells shareholders that ( Norfolk Southern is ) deadly serious and willing to commit , said Charles Vincent of PNC Asset Management Group .
The top executive of Norfolk Southern Corp admitted talks aimed at resolving a stalemate over the future of Conrail Inc will be difficult but said he remains optimistic about the outcome.I go prepared , on my own part , to negotiate hard , to negotiate fairly and to negotiate to reach a reasonable solution .
I am confident others will do the same , chief executive officer David Goode told reporters at a press conference after a meeting with Wall Street analysts .
A $ 9.5 billion planned merger between Conrail and CSX Corp has been fraught with problems due to a rival $ 10.3 billion bid from Norfolk Southern .
Conrail has rejected the Norfolk Southern offer , saying the CSX deal is a better fit.Conrail shareholders earlier this month defeated a key provision that would have permitted the planned merger to move forward .
At the same time , Norfolk Southern is in the process of buying 9.9 percent of Conrail 's stock.Speaking in a raspy voice , Goode said he would meet with Conrail and CSX on Friday .
Goode was extremely tight-lipped about details of the meeting , declining to disclose the location or who would attend .
He also said it was premature to discuss a timetable for the possible resolution of the stalemate.However , sources close to the companies earlier this week said that only Goode , Conrail chief executive David LeVan and CSX chief executive John Snow were expected to attend.Goode reiterated that Norfolk Southern would not accept any type of settlement that values Conrail at less than its offer of $ 115 per share , but added I 'm going in with a completely open mind .
Indications that negotiations were forthcoming developed last week when Goode offered to sit down with LeVan and Snow .
The two executives quickly responded in a letter saying that they would be willing to meet.Although he initially spoke only with Snow by telephone , Goode said at the press conference that he has since spoken with LeVan .
He did not discuss the nature of the conversation.The meeting with analysts focused on Norfolk Southern 's fourth quarter results , issued Wednesday , but most of the questions coming from the audience dealt with Conrail.Conrail and CSX could not immediately be reached to comment on the meeting or to confirm that their executives would attend .
The chairman of CSX Corp said he is reasonably confident , but guarded that Conrail shareholders will approve a key provision of the planned $ 9.2 billion railroad merger , adding that CSX will remain committed to the union even if the measure is defeated.John Snow also described rival bidder Norfolk Southern Corp 's latest attempt to thwart the transaction as a desperate act.Snow spoke to Reuters in a telephone interview .
Conrail shareholders will vote Friday on a provision that essentially will enable CSX to pay cash and stock for Conrail.Rival bidder Norfolk Southern , whose $ 10.3 billion offer was rejected by Conrail , late Monday offered to buy 9.9 percent of the railroad if shareholders defeat the measure.It seems to me like it 's a desperate act .
I ca n't imagine it 's going to affect very much , Snow said.However , he admitted that the offer is probably creating some confusion in the market .
Snow said the Norfolk Southern offer likely resulted from two setbacks last week .
A U.S. district court judge and the Surface Transportation Board both denied Norfolk Southern 's attempt to block the merger.They had suffered two stinging defeats .
They were probably reeling and felt the need to do something , Snow said .
He declined to speculate on the outcome of Friday 's vote , which is expected to be tallied by early next week.Under the proposed merger , neither Conrail or CSX can enter a partnership with another party before 1999 .
Snow also reiterated court testimony that CSX will not raise the bid for Conrail.Once the Street becomes convinced that this is the deal , that there is n't any other deal , that this is the price , it seems to me that we 'll ultimately win the vote , Snow said.If Conrail shareholders defeat the Friday vote , Conrail has the ability to call a new meeting.If we lose it , I think it 's going to be shame on us for not having communicated fully the benefits of this merger .
What I propose doing , if we lost it ... would be to take our time and patiently go around and talk to the shareholders -- that may take three months , that may take six months -- until they really understood the merger , he said.Snow said he spoke earlier on Tuesday with Conrail chairman David LeVan.They 're firmly committed to us .
We 're firmly committed to them .
We certainly hope we win the vote .
If we do n't win the vote , we 're still committed to each other .
We have a contract that 's binding for two years , Snow added .
CSX Corp and Conrail Inc were expected Thursday to announce sweetened terms for their proposed friendly $ 8.5 billion merger , according to sources familiar with the transaction.The new terms were expected to include a richer exchange ratio in the stock portion of the cash and stock transaction and a speedier payment to investors by setting up a voting trust for all shares , the sources said.Conrail and CSX have been discussing a sweetened deal for weeks in an attempt to appease shareholders who favour Norfolk Southern Corp 's $ 10 billion all-cash bid for Conrail.Specific details of the new terms were not immediately available .
The CSX board reportedly met on Wednesday night to discuss the new terms.A spokesman for CSX declined to comment .
Conrail could not be reached for comment.Early on Wednesday evening , a source close to the talks said the two companies were on the verge of reaching new terms.It 's very close , said the source who did not want to be identified , adding the boards were pursuing revisions that would give shareholders more value and quicker payment.Upon announcing new terms for the controversial transaction , Conrail is expected to cancel a December 23 meeting in which shareholders were set to vote on a key provision of the deal.CSX already has bought 19.9 percent of Conrail for $ 110 per share in a cash tender offer and is seeking to buy another 20.1 percent in a second cash tender offer.CSX plans to buy the remaining 60 percent of Conrail shares in stock at an exchange ratio of 1.85619 CSX shares for each Conrail share.Norfolk Southern has offered to buy Conrail for $ 110 per share in cash .
Conrail has rejected the offer , contending that a transaction with CSX is a better fit.But the Conrail-CSX merger needs shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law in order for CSX to buy another 20.1 percent of Conrail .
A U.S. judge on Tuesday ordered Conrail to conduct the December 23 meeting even though it contended that it could delay the vote if it did n't have enough shareholder support.Conrail would be permitted to delay the meeting if it revised the existing merger agreement.Shareholders have expressed concern that they would not receive payment for the stock portion of the transaction until the deal clears regulatory hurdles.The proposed merger of Conrail and CSX , first announced on October 15 , would create an powerhouse railroad on the U.S. East Coast.But a revision of terms might not signal an end to the battle for Conrail .
Industry experts have widely expected Norfolk Southern to quickly raise its bid if Conrail and CSC sweeten the terms of their proposal.A spokesman for Norfolk Southern declined to comment on whether it will be prepared to raise its offer , noting only we have said that , whatever they do , we will respond appropriately .
Western Resources Inc. on Wednesday offered to buy ADT Ltd. in a $ 3.5 billion cash and stock transaction that would transform the Kansas utility into the nation 's top provider of electronic security services.The move marks the latest step in Western 's aggressive strategy to dominate the highly fragmented security industry , which has grown increasingly attractive to utilities and telecommunication companies.Topeka , Kansas-based Western Resources , which already holds a 27 percent stake in ADT , said it would take its unsolicited offer directly to ADT shareholders .
It also said it would call a special meeting of shareholders to replace the existing ADT board of directors.We have demonstrated our belief in ADT 's future through our investment .
The benefits of this transaction are compelling , offering a natural extension of our respective businesses , Western Resources Chairman John Hayes said in a statement.Hayes advised ADT of its offer in a letter in which he noted that ADT previously said it was not interested in a transaction with Western Resources.Now , after careful study and consideration , we have determined that the potential benefits to ADT , Western Resources and ADT 's other shareowners from a combination of Western Resources and ADT are simply too compelling to ignore , Hayes wrote to ADT Chairman Michael Ashcroft .
We firmly believe that this combination will provide significant benefits to our respective shareowners , customers and employees not available to either company on its own.Western said it would pay $ 22.50 for each share of ADT , consisting of $ 15 in Western Resources common stock and $ 7.50 cash .
The offer would give ADT holders a 12 percent premium over Tuesday 's closing stock price of $ 20.125 on NYSE.ADT climbed $ 2.625 to $ 22.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange , where Western Resources ' stock was unchanged at $ 31.25.Western 's proposal also calls for ADT shareholders to receive the equivalent of a 99 cents per ADT share annual dividend .
ADT does not presently pay a dividend.Boca Raton , Fla.-based ADT said it would review the offer in due course and advised shareholders to await a recommendation from its board.The offer for ADT marks the second security acquisition proposal made this week by Western Resources .
On Monday , Western Resources announced plans to buy the security business of Westinghouse Electric Corp. for $ 368 million in cash.Long considered a premier property in the electronic security industry , ADT earlier this year was to be acquired by Republic Industries Inc. for $ 5 billion .
But that transaction collapsed in September after months of uncertainty due to stock price volatility.Western Resources has been aggressively pursuing deals in other areas .
It has mounted a $ 1.9 billion takeover bid for Kansas City .
Mo.-based Kansas City Power & amp ; Light Co.Last week , Western Resources agreed to sell its natural gas assets to Oklahoma-based Oneok Inc. in a $ 660 million deal in which Western Resources will take a large stake in Oneok , the parent of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co .
The utility 's customers could become clients for Western Resources ' other services , such as home security .
When ITT broke into three companies in 1995 , top executives said the move would increase value for stockholders , fuel growth and make the separate businesses more competitive.But independence has come at a high price for the former conglomerate 's hotel , casino and entertainment division known as ITT Corp. Industry competition is fiercer than ever before , a huge expansion plan has been unexpectedly difficult , and the company 's stock price has eroded dramatically in the past few months .
And now , rival Hilton Hotels Corp is prepared to launch a $ 6.5 billion hostile takeover of the company whose assets include some of the world 's best-known properties - from the New York Knicks to Sheraton hotels to Madison Square Garden.ITT has always bought the highest-quality assets .
When they go out and buy something , they always buy the best and they 've always paid a lot of money for those assets - maybe too much - but the bottom line is they own some top quality assets , said Bruce Raabe of Collins & amp ; Co .
It is the appeal of those assets and the view that they should be contributing more to the company 's bottom line that may make ITT vulnerable , industry experts said.So far , ITT has said little about the Hilton offer other than it will consider it .
A source familiar with ITT said its board has a regularly scheduled meeting next Tuesday.An ITT spokesman could not be reached for comment.But industry analysts widely believe the $ 55 cash and stock offer made by Hilton undervalues the company .
Shares of ITT soared 14-1/4 to 56-7/8 on views that any transaction will come at a higher price than the Monday offer .
Wall Street sources knowledgeable about ITT 's operations admit the giant company has faltered in recent months even as it has pursued an aggressive path of expansion .
The company , which has earmarked $ 2.5 billion for expansion , lost out to Hilton in a bid for Bally Entertainment Corp and has suffered construction project setbacks and losses from its high-stakes bacarrat tables in Las Vegas.Remember , this company has only been public for a year .
The company gets a lot of attention and it does n't shrink from doing aggressive things , said one Wall Street source who did not want to be identified .
But others said the company 's acquisition strategy is not well focused , the construction problems were avoidable and the company 's management does not have a strong background in operating casinos .
Chief executive Rand Araskog ran the conglomerate since 1979 and took control of the new ITT Corp after overseeing the three-way split .
President Robert Bowman is considered to be an extremely savvy financier , but does not comes from the gaming industry.This is a team that is n't working very well together .
Araskog is the behind-the-desk kind of CEO instead of the kind of guy who 's out living and breathing his business .
Bowman is working with intellect and energy , but without a good perspective of the business , said one industry expert who did not want to be identified.ITT , which is expected to rebuff the takeover effort , is likely to tout its future plans as an enticement for shareholders.The less-than-favorable publicity , some of which has been unfair , that the officers of ITT have received , has overshadowed the fact that management is looking at long-term plans , but fast management is now more respected than long-term planning , said Bjorn Hanson , hospitality industry chairman at Coopers & amp ; Lybrand .
Norfolk Southern Corp. Monday launched a new effort to derail a planned $ 9.1 billion merger between Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp. , proposing to buy a stake in Conrail even though its takeover offer has been rejected.The Norfolk , Va.-based railroad said it would buy 9.9 percent of Conrail stock for $ 115 per share if investors defeat a key provision that would allow the proposed Conrail-CSX union to move forward .
Norfolk Southern made its offer in a direct appeal to Conrail shareholders , many of whom are unhappy with the proposed Conrail-CSX transaction.Conrail shareholders are scheduled to vote on the provision Friday at a special meeting in Philadelphia.Philadelphia-based Conrail has rejected Norfolk Southern 's $ 10.3 billion cash offer , saying that the $ 9.1 billion cash and stock transaction with CSX provides more strategic benefits.Conrail is asking shareholders to waive a Pennsylvania law that effectively requires CSX , which already owns 19.9 percent of Conrail shares , to pay $ 110 per share in cash for the rest.If shareholders waive that provision , Richmond , Va.-based CSX will buy another 20 percent of Conrail shares for $ 110 per share and acquire the rest of Conrail in stock.Norfolk Southern asked shareholders to reject the measure , saying it would amend its existing all-cash offer in order to buy about 8.2 million Conrail shares .
The purchase of the shares would represent the maximum number of shares that Norfolk Southern can buy without triggering Conrail 's poison pill anti-takeover defence plan.Once completed , Norfolk Southern would then begin a second offer for all remaining Conrail shares.Norfolk Southern said the 9.9 percent offer would not be subject to termination of the merger agreement between Conrail and CSX and would not require any action by Conrail 's board.Conrail shareholders have an opportunity to reassert control over their corporation and reject the coercive tactics being used to pressure them into approving CSX 's inferior offer , Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode said in a statement.Officials from Conrail and CSX could not immediately be reached for comment.Norfolk Southern announced its plan after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.It also said a vote to reject the CSX/Conrail measure would signal the beginning of the process to unseat Conrail directors at Conrail 's next annual meeting .
