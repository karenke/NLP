Underwriters to the heavily under-subscribed Stadium Australia float would not seek to cut their losses and sell the unbought passes at a discount ahead of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, Stadium Australia chairman Peter Ritc hie said on Wednesday.
Ritchie told Reuters the underwriters would seek to sell the approximately A$200 million worth of unsold passes over the next couple of years at prices above the float's offer prices.
"They have a couple of years and they're super-confident that they'll sell them and maybe even get more for them between now and the Games," Ritchie said in an interview.
"Our existing gold members are of course concerned that they (the passes) may be discounted and I can assure them that that won't happen because as the Games get closer there'd be more recognition that the prime seats that go with the gold packages wi ll get more and more valuable," he said.
Earlier, Ritchie confirmed market speculation of a A$200 million-plus shortfall in the A$364.4 million float of Stadium gold and platinum passes.
The 35,000 passes offered included packages of main stadium tickets to the 2000 Olympics, a 30-year stadium membership and an equity stake in the stadium itself.
"My rough top-of-the-head calculation is that it is about 40 percent (sold)," he said.
The underwriters, ANZ Securities, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Macquarie Bank Ltd and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, are not due to announce the exact results of the float until this Friday.
They must fund the project regardless of whether all the packages are sold, thus guaranteeing the completion of the 110,000-seat stadium, which is due to open in 1999 in time for a season of pre-Olympic competitions.
The Stadium Australia float, which closed last Thursday, had been open for almost six months, more than twice as long as most share offers.
Its offer of 34,400 gold packages at A$10,000 each and 600 platinum passes at A$33,000 each opened on October 7 and its closing date has been extended twice due to lack of demand.
Brokers said the float had been too complicated for investors to generate enough enthusiasm. Ritchie acknowledged the underwriters had been over-confident and that its structure may have been difficult.
He said the underwriters were targeting a sharemarket listing for the stapled stadium shares and memberships around April 11.
Once the stadium was opened in 1999 however, the stadium shares and the stadium memberships would be unstapled and be traded separately.
Ritchie said the stadium would manage a private market for the stadium memberships, similar to those managed for other Australian stadiums like the Melbourne and Sydney Cricket grounds.
He said he expected the new Sydney stadium memberships would be worth more than those for these other grounds.
"There's no reason to think that our memberships won't sell for more than their's because our facilities are so much better and we'll know then who the hirees (sporting group users) are."
He said Stadium Australian already had strong expressions of interest from the Australian Football League (AFL) which runs the Victorian-based Australian rules competition.
"Strangely enough when it's not really their territory, they've been the most enthusiastic and then we'd have to reconfigure the stadium specification for an oblong field."
Ritchie said the stadium would be designed with mobile stands so after the Olympics the stadium could be converted into an oval easily.
"You put the big stands on wheels and you roll them back for the oval." Stadium Australia had also had talks with the major winter sporting codes in New South Wales, Rugby Union and Rugby League.

A 22 percent rise in fee and other non-interest income boosted Westpac Banking Corp Ltd to a surprisingly strong first half profit result on Wednesday, more than offsetting the effect of a squeeze on interest margins.
Westpac announced a net profit of A$638 million for the six months to March 31, up from A$565 million in the same period a year earlier.  
Analysts said this was about A$20 million to A$30 million above their expectations, but had not shocked those in the market who had pushed Westpac's share price higher in recent weeks in anticipation of very strong result.
"That's why the stock hasn't bounced as much as you'd expect it to," Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said.
Westpac's shares were down five cents at A$7.45 at 3.40 p.m. (0540 GMT), having earlier jumped to a A$7.60 high.  
The profit jump was due largely to non-interest income rising to A$869 million from A$714 million, underpinned by rising account fees and some profits from the sale of property and closed branches.
The boost from fees more than offset sluggish growth in interest income as Westpac, like Australia's other major banks, battled a 150 basis point squeeze in home lending margins.
Westpac's group net interest margin fell to 3.55 percent in the six months to March 31 from 3.75 percent in the six months to September.  
Non-bank competitors funded by mortgage origination have snared more than 10 percent of the home mortgage market in the past three years, forcing banks to cut their home loan margins by about 150 basis points to about 100 to 150 basis points.
"Features of the first half financial results were non-interest expense control, continued improvement in asset quality, improved staff productivity, and higher non-interest income reflecting: growth in commissions and fees, higher financial markets income and benefits from the sale of equity investments," Westpac managing director Bob Joss said in a statement.  
"These results were achieved against a background of reduced interest margins and continued investments in strategic capabilities designed to enhance future prospects," Joss said.
Westpac's net interest income fell to A$1.695 billion in the six months ended March 31 from A$1.705 billion in the six months to September 30 last year, but was up on the A$1.549 billion in the year-ago period.
Income from fees and commissions rose to A$592 million from A$532 million in the year-ago first half.
Other income, which included the sale of equity investments, rose to A$142 million from A$68 million a year earlier.  
Westpac also announced it planned to raise up to A$500 million through a preference share issue after its merger with Bank of Melbourne Ltd.
Westpac said it would issue up to 20 million non-cumulative converting preference share at an issue price of A$25 each. The money raised would be used to fund the cash component under the Bank of Melbourne merger scheme, it said.

Brokers Were Stockbroking and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett had placed all of The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd's 616.6 million Foster's Brewing Group Ltd shares with institutions and private clients by early on Friday, Were said.
Retail investors bought about A$150 million of the A$1.535 billion package of shares, with about 55 percent of the remainder being sold to overseas institutional investors and about 45 percent sold to local institutions, Were Stockbroking managing director John Paterson said.  
Paterson pointed to a A$2.5 billion-equivalent placement of three percent of The British Petroleum Co Plc shares in May as possibly the largest such placement this year.
The Kuwait Investment Office sold three percent or 170 million of BP's shares through Goldman Sachs in mid-May this year for about 7.0 stg per share.
Paterson said the two brokers began placing the stock at about 3.30 p.m. (0530 GMT) on Thursday after Foster's announced the buy-back of 13.0 percent of its capital from Asahi Breweries Ltd and BHP's placement of 616.6 million Foster's shares. The buy-back and placement were at A$2.49 per share.  
Were and ABN AMRO's Australian offices worked until very late on Thursday night before handing it over to their New York and European offices.
Paterson said the buy-back was completed at about 9.00 a.m. (2330 GMT).
"We had strong institutional support in Australia, similarly in London and Europe, particularly London, and in the United States," Paterson said.
Private client support from Were's New Zealand and Australian clients was also strong, he said.  
"The other satisfying fact is you tend to assume after one of these deals that you've exhausted the demand in the market place, but with the stock trading up at A$2.55 against the placement price of A$2.49, it says there's still quite a lot of untapped demand out there," he said.
Foster's shares were down five cents at A$2.55 at 1.40 p.m. (0340 GMT) on 675 million shares put through the market.
Foster's said on Thursday it expected foreign investors to hold about a third of its shares after the reconstruction.  
Foster's said BHP had agreed to limit individual investors to parcels of no more than five percent of BHP's Foster's shares.
Paterson said the successful completion of the deal was satisfying for Were and ABN AMRO Hoare Govett and they were now looking forward to a rest.
"I won't mind having a three day weekend," he said.
Monday is the Queen's Birthday holiday in Australia.

Australia's largest home mortgage lender warned on Wednesday that a proposed change to Australia's system of prudential regulation could lead to huge collapses like those seen in the U.S. savings and loan system.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia Managing Director David Murray said proposals by a government-sponsored inquiry into the financial system to regulate banks, pension funds, insurers and other non-banks within the same prudential system was too risky.
Murray told an audience of bankers and economists the proposal would create a system similar to that which regulated the U.S. savings and loan sector before widespread collapses in the 1980s.
"These proposals do take us into uncharted waters which set up for Australia a savings and loans system that cost the citizens of the United States an awful lot of money," he said.
Murray's criticism of the plan to open up the banking payments system to greater competition and strip the Reserve Bank of Australia of its prudential supervision role is the first major attack on the official Wallis' report on the financial system since its release last week.
The conservative Liberal/National government, which set up the Wallis Inquiry soon after its election last year, is currently considering Wallis' recommendations and is expected to make its recommendations later this year.
Murray's broadside was immediately attacked by one of his audience at a Committee for Economic Development (CEDA) luncheon as emotive scare-mongering.
Replying to a question from the floor, Murray said he would not back away from his comments, adding a bank or fund failure was too was too dangerous to risk changing the current system.
He said the time was right to debate Wallis' plan and others should not shy away from being critical.
At the moment, the Reserve Bank requires banks and others with banking licences to meet strict prudential requirements on capital reserves and stops non-banks from issuing cheques or allowing them access to the overnight payments system.
The inquiry, headed by businessman Stan Wallis, recommended that non-banks such as pension funds, building societies and even telecommunications groups be allowed access to the payments system and be covered by a single new body called the Australian Prudential Regulation Commission.
"I would prefer that the Reserve Bank remain the prudential supervisor," Murray said.
Later, Murray rejected the claim that he was scaremongering.
"More Australians have chosen to bank with us than any other financial institution. We're probably better aware of what is scaremongering and what is proper community debate than anybody else," he told reporters after his luncheon address.
Commonwealth Bank which was government-owned until last year, has the largest number of retail savings and other accounts of all of Australia's banks.
"It's a matter of fact that the S&amp;L system in America cost their community A$110 billion (US$86 billion)," he said.
"Why should I therefore condone a supervisory system that appears to be built that way," he said.
"(Wallis) has deliberately overlaid a number of deposit-taking institutions into one supervisory system. That's what the American system did and they got the S&amp;L problem.
"I see that potential here and I hope that it doesn't happen," he said.

If there was any doubt that Prime Minister John Howard's government is obsessed with keeping the "battlers" happy, then Treasurer Peter Costello wiped those out on Wednesday.
Costello could have simply given up his veto on big bank mergers, passing on any bank merger judgement to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) if, as he said, his primary concern was to make the banks more competitive.
The Wallis Inquiry, which Costello set up, recommended he do just that.
Instead he kept the veto and made up his own mind about how competitive the banks are now by telling the big four they could not merge until they become more competitive.
It's the ACCC's job to judge if a merger reduces competition and Costello is happy to let them pass jugdement in every other sector of the economy, so why not let ACCC Chairman Allan Fels decide on the banks?
The answer became clear when Costello was asked just this question in his news conference on Wednesday. Here's his reply.
"We are a government. We are elected. We are going to account to the Australian people and we have reserved to ourselves, at this stage, the decision that there will not be mergers between the four majors, and we have reserved to ourselves the decision to ensure that the Australian financial system still has healthy Australian ownership.
"We consider that a matter of public policy."
Costello's motivation becomes even clearer when you look at his reasoning for keeping a 'four pillars' policy.
"We do not have a competitive enough access for small business to financial services," he said.
"One of the things that we would be interested in seeing is new entrants, non-bank institutions, starting to develop widely used financial lending practices, in relation to small business."
For small business, read 'battlers'.
The same battlers John Howard has pledged to serve again and again since his election on March 3 last year.
Howard knows the battlers at least dislike the large banks and that they fear what the banks might do to bank fees and charges if they were allowed to get even more powerful.
Even the banks' own consumer surveys show they are very unpopular.
The last thing Howard wants is the ACCC telling him a bank merger is all right and being forced to swallow it.
The battlers, and therefore Howard, know better.
The prognosis for a change of heart is not good.
If the government cannot ignore the politics of bank mergers when it has a massive majority in the lower house, is two years out from the next scheduled election, and is in its first term of government, then when will it?
Some bank analysts expect a change of heart after the inevitable election win in 1999.
Don't bet on it while Costello and Howard are bowing to the battlers.

Global media group News Corp Ltd told analysts in a telephone briefing on Thursday that it still expected 20 percent profit growth for the 1996/97 year, despite a below-expectations first half profit result, analysts said.
"They did say that they're still on track for the 20 percent growth," one senior Sydney media analyst said after the morning teleconference briefing between company officials and U.S. and Australian analysts.  
Another senior media analyst, who also asked not to be named, said News had repeated its August 1996 forecast of 20 percent profit growth in the teleconference.
"Yes. They've got no worries about reaching that one," the analyst said.
Earlier on Thursday, News Corp posted a A$731 million net profit before abnormals for the six months to December 31, up 10.3 percent on the same period a year earlier.
But this was below analysts expectations of a pre-abnormals net profit for the half of A$735 million to A$775 million.

Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Australian-listed stocks slumped five to ten percent on Monday as international investors fearful of a law and order meltdown reacted to the army's attempt to force the PNG government aside.
Orogen Minerals Ltd, which is 51 percent owned by the PNG government, was one of the hardest hit, slumping seven percent or 24 cents to A$3.20. 
Other stocks jagged as much as ten percent lower in increasingly hectic afternoon trade as reports emerged that the head of the army and the police commissioner had told Prime Minister Julius Chan to resign or be forced aside in two days.
The army and police are angry the government has employed mercenaries to help the armed forces subdue seccessionists on Bougainville Island.
Brokers and analysts said investors feared an army mutiny and possible civil unrest in the capital Port Moresby would spread to the remote areas where most of PNG's huge gold mines and oil projects are located.  
"The danger is if any local tribes use this dispute as an excuse to act up and this would affect local mining operations," said Shaw Stockbroking research director Michael Heffernan.
Major mining projects in Papua New Guinea's rugged hinterlands like the giant OK Tedi project, controlled by the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, are often in dispute with local tribal groups.
Analysts said investors' need look no further than the now-dormant copper project on Bougainville to see what happens when the central government and armed forces lose control.  
The Bougainville Copper mine was shut down in 1989 when rebellious landowners who wanted bigger returns from the project sabotaged the mine and began the current recessionist revolt.
"There's always a certain amount of civil unrest, but if the more militant groups in the regions use this as an excuse to party as it were, it could disrupt operations," Heffernan said.
Local brokers became increasingly pessimistic through the afternoon, moving in anticipation of an expected selloff by overseas institutional investors.  
"I don't know what the outcome of that (situation) is going to be but it seems to me to be very dismal," said broker Kevin Lourey of Melbourne-based brokerage, Peake Lands Kirwan.
"The international reaction to this sort of situation is usually very negative," said resources analyst David Walker at broker ABN AMRO Hoare Govett
"The fear is that tonight, particularly on the London exchange, where most of the resource investment in this part of the world comes fron, there will be a strong negative reaction," Walker said.  
The worst-affected stock in the afternoon rout was oil producer and explorer Oil Search Ltd, which fell 8.5 percent or 24 cents to A$2.60.
Bougainville Copper Ltd, which is controlled by RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd fell five cents to 55 cents.
Analysts said the government's moves over next day or two would be crucial in limiting any further damage. Prime Minister Chan had yet to respond to the army ultimatum by 0820 GMT.
"The next 24 hours is crucial for the Chan government and also for the value of these investments," Walker said.  
"It's important that the situation becomes as clear as it can very quickly in order not only for the stability of the country, but for the value of the investments."

Australian television network, The Seven Network Ltd, is expected to report a 25-30 percent higher pre-abnormal annual net profit on Monday, but analysts said this rise was likely to disguise a second half profit slowdown.
"Second half sales growth is going to be quite modest because the Ten Network and Seven lost to Nine," said one Sydney analyst.
"And post-Olympics the group hasn't bounced back," he said.
Seven had the Australian TV rights to the Atlanta Olympic Games, after it closed its books on June 30.  
The median forecast in BZW Australia's Barceps survey of analysts was for a pre-abnormals net profit for the year to June 30 of A$114 million.
Forecasts range from A$105 million to A$120.7 million and compares with the A$88.5 million posted in 1994/95.
But that 1994/95 figure was cut heavily by a bungle over discounted advertising rates, which cost Seven A$20-30 million and which has been reversed.
A A$114 million net profit would also represent slow growth from the already booked first half profit of A$91.88 million.  
Seven managing director Gary Rice said in April he expected a better second half in 1995/96 than for the discounting-affected second half of 1994/95.
Seven has also said it expected advertising sales in 1995/96 would be six to seven percent higher for the year, after sales growth of 7.5 percent in the first half of 1995/96.
Analysts said ratings losses to the dominant Nine Network, owned by Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, had softened advertising sales. The Ten Network, majority owned by Canada's Canwest, had also been hit by Nine's strength, they said.  
Some said higher costs linked to an expansion of news and current affairs programming may also restrain second half profits.
"Most people will be looking out to see that the move to more news and current affairs will not have caused a blowout in costs," said Burdett, Buckridge and Young media analyst Vince Pepe.
"They'll also be looking for Seven's future strategy in relation to news and current affairs, given the existing strategy appears to have floundered in some time slots," Pepe said.  
Seven recently cancelled a new 5.00 p.m. national news programme after a short trial because of poor ratings and the recently launched Witness flagship current affairs programme has not been a runaway ratings hit.
Other analysts said Seven may have contained its costs.
"Costs have been pretty well contained in the four to five percent industry range, by dropping costs and laying off people quietly to accommodate the extra news and current affairs push," said a Sydney media analyst.
Analysts would also focus on further details about the future of Hollywood film studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  
Seven and Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp agreed in July to pay US$1.3 billion for the studio.
"We'll be looking for any further indications on MGM because when the actual transaction has been completed I believe the business plan there will have changed quite considerably," said Pepe.
Seven itself is 15 percent owned by News Corp Ltd and about 20 percent owned by Seven chairman Kerry Stokes.
Seven's shares were down five cents at A$3.80 at 2.15 p.m. (0415 GMT).

The consortium building the 2000 Olympic Stadium in Sydney has sought permission from the International Olympic Committee to sell Games tickets overseas after struggling to find local buyers for its financing scheme.
The Stadium Australia group -- hoping to ride the coat-tails of Atlanta Games enthusiasm -- said in October it wanted to raise A$364.4 million (US$282.4 million) by selling packages of Olympic tickets, equity and stadium memberships.
But a lack of local buyers for the 34,400 packages, which sell for A$10,000 each, has twice forced underwriters to extend their deadline for the novel Olympic float.
As a result of the slow demand, Stadium Australia want to sell the ticket component of the package separately to overseas buyers after originally restricting the scheme to the domestic market.
"We are in negotiation with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). We are also talking to the Olympic committees in the U.S., U.K. and several other countries," a Stadium Australia spokeswoman told Reuters.
The underwriters must fund the project regardless of whether all the packages are sold, thus guaranteeing the completion of the 110,000-seat stadium, which is due to open in 1999 at a cost of A$660 million.
Each "Gold" package includes one seat at each of the stadium sessions during the Olympics, a seat at most sporting events at the stadium until 2029 and 1,000 shares in the Stadium company.
But city brokers said on Friday only about one third of the packages had been sold as Olympic enthusiasm in the wake of Australia's record medal haul at Atlanta had waned and the local economy had slowed.
"There's just not much demand for them and the talk around is only about 30 to 40 percent are spoken for," one Sydney broker said.
Other brokers said repeated attempts to interest private clients had met with little success.
If the brokers are correct and the consortium fails to raise any further finance, the stadium's underwriters could be exposed to a shortfall of about A$240 million when the share and ticket offer closes on March 27.
The Stadium Australia spokeswoman said the offer was not in trouble and there was enough time to raise the capital, adding that "considerably more than one third" of the packages had already been sold.
"The demand has not been as great as originally anticipated locally but we have experienced the reverse internationally," the spokeswoman said. "It is a question not of whether we are going to sell them but who we are going to sell them to."
The four underwriters are ANZ Securities, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Macquarie Bank Ltd, and ABN Amro Hoare Govett.

Australasian-based building products group James Hardie Industries Ltd posted weaker annual profits on Wednesday, but forecast its expanding U.S. fibre cement and gypsum units would drive a profit surge in 1997/98.
"For the first time in several years we have the production capacity to meet U.S. market demand," James Hardie managing director Keith Barton said.
"If current trading conditions prevail, we expect very strong growth in (U.S.) sales and earnings to continue in the year ahead," Barton told a briefing for analysts and reporters.
"(Group) operating profit after tax for the current year will improve significantly compared to the past year," he said.
James Hardie's net profit jumped to A$83 million (US$63 million) in the year to March 31 from A$32.2 million in 1995/96, but this was due largely to a A$31.7 million abnormal profit from asset sales.
Profit before abnormals fell 12.3 percent to A$51.3 million because of sharply lower Australasian buliding materials profits and this was in line with expectations.
But Barton's comments at the briefing about continuing weakness in the Australian and New Zealand building materials markets prompted some analysts to downgrade their forecasts for the 1997/98 year.
James Hardies' Australian operations, hit by a 12 percent fall in home construction, slumped to a A$800,000 pre-tax loss in 1996/97 from a A$33.8 million profit in 1995/96.
New Zealand profits fell eight percent to A$31.9 million.
Barton said competition in Australia and New Zealand remained intense and would continue to slice away at sales, margins and profits in 1997/98.
"The modest recovery in Australian housing construction will not be sufficient to offset the impact of growing competition on our Australian fibre cement business," Barton said.
Increased imports would pressure margins and volumes in New Zealand, he said.
Barton also told the analysts briefing that new competition coming on stream in the United States and James Hardie's drive to increase market share there would pressure prices down.
"We may have to discount ... be more aggressive against engineered wood products and against PVC," he said.
"But that doesn't necessarily mean a reduction in margins," he said, adding sales volumes would continue to grow and economies of scale were still to be obtained, Barton said.
Some analysts said Barton's comments about Australasian weakness and U.S. price pressure would force them to downgrade their 1997/98 pre-abnormal profit forecasts to about A$80 million to A$85 million from A$90 million to A$90 million before the results.
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett building materials analyst Fabian Babich said he would keep his 1997/98 forecast at A$80 million.
Hardie kept its final dividend for 1996/97 unchanged at 6.5 cents per share, taking full year dividends to an unchanged 13.0 cents per share.
Hardie is about 28 percent owned by Brierley Investments Ltd.
Hardie's shares closed down 15 cents at A$4.05.

Bre-X Minerals Ltd. chief geologist Michael de Guzman, who co-discovered the richest gold find this century, may have committed suicide when he fell out of a helicopter on Wednesday, a company spokesman said on Thursday.
Rescue crews were still searching the dense Borneo rain forest for de Guzman's body after he plunged 800 feet from a helicopter en route to the Busang site in Indonesia's East Kalamantan province.
Bre-X spokesman Steve McAnulty said company officials obtained a copy of an apparent suicide note found by Indonesian police among de Guzman's belongings.
"Mike did leave a note. Basically the upshot of it is Mike had just learned that he had hepatitis B. The prognosis was not good due to the fact that he had suffered many bouts of malaria which had weakened his system over the years," McAnulty said in a telephone interview.
"We understand the prognosis was not good for recovery and apparently there was a lot of pain involved and he decided he did not want to go through that," McAnulty said.
He added that foul play was not suspected and Indonesian police were treating his death as suicide.
The 40-year-old Filipino geologist was a key member of the team that discovered Busang a few years ago.
Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X has agreed to develop the Busang site, valued at $25 billion, with U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. and Indonesian partners.
De Guzman, a 20-year mining industry veteran, was also credited with co-discovering the large Dizon copper-gold deposit in the Phillipines.
John Felderhof, Bre-X's senior vice-president of exploration, was traveling to Indonesia to replace de Guzman at scheduled meetings with Freeport-McMoRan.
The incident was the latest tragedy involving Canadian mining companies in far-flung corners of the world.
In October 1995, nine employees of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco Corp. were killed in a helicopter crash in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan.
The Kyrgyzstan Air helicopter, chartered by a Cameco unit, was en route from the Kumtor gold mine when it went down.
The families of the nine Canadians killed in the crash have filed a C$20.7 million ($15.1 million) lawsuit alleging Cameco and other defendants were negligent.
In September 1996, Falconbridge Ltd. Chief Executive Franklin Pickard died of a heart attack when visiting the Toronto-based company's copper site high in Chile's Andes Mountains.
Bre-X's stock rose C20 cents to C$17.45 on the Toronto Stock Echange on Thursday.

Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves is expected to deliver more good news on the province's deficit when he delivers the 1997/98 budget next month.
Economists said on Monday a brighter fiscal picture may allow Eves to speed up implementing the second stage of a promised 30 percent income tax cut.
Eves earlier said the 1997/98 budget for the fiscal year ended March 31 will be released on May 6.
It is the ruling Conservatives' second full budget since they swept to power in Canada's most-populous province in 1995.
In February, Eves revised the 1996/97 budget deficit to C$7.67 billion, down C$508 million from his original budget forecast.
Economists said a strong economy and a C$650 million contingency reserve could lower the final 1996/97 deficit figure to around C$7 billion.
They said Eves should also better his C$6.6 billion deficit forecast for 1997/98.
"Given the strength we've seen in the economy in recent months and improved prospects for the rest of 1997. It may come in even below that (C$6 billion) level," said Nesbitt Burns senior economist Doug Porter.
The government's contingency reserve is used to reduce the deficit if it is not needed for unexpected spending needs.
Royal Bank of Canada economist Craig Wright said he also expected a deficit of around C$7 billion in 1996/97, falling to about C$6 billion in 1997/98.
"They have used relatively conservative economic assumptions and contingency reserves and it shouldn't be a problem hitting next year's target and maybe going lower," Wright said.
In his third quarter report last February, Eves said government revenues grew faster than projected due to a rebounding economy, almost C$1.2 billion higher than forecast.
He said the first stage of the government's 30 percent income tax cut had helped boost consumer confidence in Ontario. About half od the tax reduction has been implemented, with the remaining 15 percent due by 1999.
The province's improving finances has led to speculation that Eves may accelerate the timing of remaining tax cuts.
"Usually where there is smoke there is fire and they (the government) have certainly been quite forward talking about that possibility. It wouldn't be a big surprise if they did accelerate it," Porter said.
Wright said the government's negotiations with Ontario's municipalities on the funding of services may prevent a speedier tax cut.

Shares in Bre-X Minerals Ltd. soared on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday as rumors continued to swirl around the Busang gold deposit and analysts sifted through drill results from the site.
The Calgary, Alberta-based company's stock jumped C$1.22 to close at C$3.62 on massive turnover of 17 million shares on Canada's biggest stock market.
Frenzied late afternoon trading pushed the volatile stock to a session high of C$5.75.
Bre-X has been embroiled in controversy since preliminary tests by its partner, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc., on the gold property indicated the deposit may contain "insignificant" amounts of gold.
The announcement prompted panic selling of Bre-X shares last month, lopping almost C$3 billion ($2.2 billion), or more than 80 percent, from the company's stock market value.
Reports on Wednesday that Freeport recently received the first independent tests of the Busang deposit by a Canadian firm were challenged by Freeport and Bre-X officials.
The reports said Freeport received the tests while Freeport Chief Executive Jim Bob Moffett was in Indonesia and held meetings with President Suharto.
"The testing is still going on and Freeport has not been informed of any assay results," Freeport spokeswoman Kristen Lemkau told Reuters by telephone.
Bre-X commissioned Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. last month to conduct an audit of its Busang project. The results are expected in early May.
"The audit was commissioned by Bre-X and it is going to be submitted to Bre-X," said Bre-X spokesman Richard Wool, adding that it was Bre-X that would release the audit results.
Bre-X late on Tuesday released drill results from 22 holes at the Busang property that were not included in its resource calculation of 70.95 million ounces of gold released on February 17.
Bre-X said 16 holes produced values ranging from 1.05 grams per tonne to 7.58 grams per tonne, while six holes showed no significant amount of gold.
"They were sort of old holes, but I think investors are taking it positively," said one mining analyst.
John Kaiser, editor of the Kaiser Bottom-Fishing Report, said the drill results released on Tuesday were positive, but not enough to quash the controversy surrounding Busang.
He said the final word on Busang was still up to two weeks away.
"We need to know what the numbers for this deposit run as produced by strictly controlled sampling, drilling and assaying procedures. Until we get a batch of results where we know that there is nothing screwy along the way, everything is uncertain," Kaiser said.
The Busang saga took another curious twist on Wednesday when an Indonesian company linked to President Suharto raised its stake in the Busang property.
Nusamba Group, 80 percent-owned by three foundations headed by President Suharto, raised its stake in the main Busang II section to 25 percent. Pt Askatindo Karya Minerals reduced its stake to five percent from 15 percent, said a spokesman for the family-owned company.
Bre-X has a 45 percent stake in Busang, Freeport has 15 percent and the Indonesian government 10 percent.

Canada's top securities regulator said on Thursday it is probing whether Bre-X Minerals Ltd, mired in controversy over its Busang gold find in Indonesia, breached insider trading and disclosure laws.
The Ontario Securities Commisson said the Calgary-based gold prospector has been under investigation since the end of 1996. But it did not reveal details of the probe until today.
"The OSC can confirm that the investigation relates to whether there has been a breach of continuous disclosure requirements or insider trading provisions," the regulator said in a statement.
The OSC said it has not determined whether there is enough information to begin formal proceedings against Bre-X, but the investigation is focusing on whether there were breaches of Ontario's Securities Act.
The regulator's announcement was among several fresh twists in the Bre-X Minerals saga.
A group of Canadian Bre-X shareholders launched a class action lawsuit on Thursday, adding to the five court actions the company already faces in the United States.
Frantic trading in Bre-X shares handcuffed the Toronto Stock Exchange once again on Thursday -- the third time this week that the TSE has stopped Bre-X due to heavy order volumes and a creaky computer system.
A much-anticipated report on Bre-X's assay program at Busang confirmed the company's orginal findings on Thursday. But analysts said the highly technical report by Kilborn SNC Lavalin Inc also raised new questions about the controversial gold project.
Bre-X has been under seige since last week when its partner in Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. , revealed that early drilling samples performed during its due diligence process on the Busang gold property in the rain forests of Borneo turned up only tiny amounts of gold.
Panic selling lopped nearly C$3 billion off the company's market value last Thursday and the stock has since played havoc with the TSE's old computer trading system.
Bre-X climbed C23 cents to C$3.34 on brisk turnover of 5.02 million shares before the Toronto exchange was forced to stop trading at 1243 EST/1743 GMT on Thursday.
The TSE again cited "systems problems caused by high levels of order flow in (the) company's stock."
The trading problems irritated investors and further embarrassed the exchange, which has been the butt of jokes recently on the U.S. financial news television channel CNBC.
The stock continued trading on the Nasdaq, Montreal and Alberta exchanges. The TSE said it will resume trading at 0930 EST/1430 GMT on Friday.
Kilborn, a unit of engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc performed the original resource calculations on Busang showing it contained an estimated 70.95 million ounces of gold.
The firm confirmed its findings on Thursday, based on assay samples provided to it by Bre-X.
"The standard deviation and variance observed in the analysis of the database is consistent with previous test work done on Busang samples...," said the report, which was released by the Toronto Stock Exchange and the OSC.
Bre-X chief executive officer David Walsh promised on Monday the report would shed light on Bre-X's testing methods. But Bre-X told the TSE and OSC on Thursday that the report contained no new material information.
"Our view is investors should have as much information available to make their own decisions. We thought it should be out there," OSC chairman Jack Geller told Reuters.
Analysts said the Kilborn report does not resolve the controversy over Busang, but did provide a few details not known before.
The hammer mill process used by Bre-X "can produce a non-reliable sample in the preparation process," a mining analyst said. "If there is a problem here, it is in within the sample preparation. It is not in the assays, it's problem in the sample preparation."
Bre-X has hired an mining consultant, Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd, to conduct an independent drilling program and audit of the Busang site. Strathcona is expected to deliver its report by early May.
"What everyone is waiting for is the actual independent drilling by Strathcona," said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.

A monster shakeup of Canada's biggest city, Toronto, has sparked a citizens' revolt against Ontario's ruling Conservatives and raised eyebrows among those do business in the country's financial capital.
This clean, peaceful city -- sometimes dubbed "New York run by the Swiss" -- has recently become a battleground in the so-called "Common Sense Revolution" initiated by Ontario's Conservative Premier Mike Harris.
Promising leaner, cheaper government, Harris wants to merge Toronto and six neighbouring municipalities into a single "megacity" of 2.4 million people. The new city would hold about eight percent of Canada's 30 million people and dwarf all but three of Canada's 10 provinces.
Harris also plans a fundamental shift in how public services -- everything from education to welfare -- are delivered and paid for.
Opponents fear the municipal reform blitz will drive up taxes and lead to the kind of urban decay witnessed in many cities in the United States, just across the border.
The threat of such wrenching change being rammed through without a binding plebiscite has outraged citizens and prompted accusations of tyranny and fascism.
"Government is not elected for the politicians. It is elected by the people for the people," Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall told a crowd after residents in the seven affected areas voted three to one against a merger in a referendum last week.
The vote was not binding on Ontario's government, which has vowed to press ahead with its plan.
GOVERNMENT IS ADAMANT
The referendum capped a campaign which saw an Ontario cabinet minister likened to Adolf Hitler, bomb threats against a polling firm, and thousands of protesters marching in the streets in a re-enactment of a civic rebellion in 1837.
Harris has held firm. "I don't think we can withdraw the need for change," he said, adding that there may be amendments when the legislation is introduced.
The "megacity" revolt has grabbed headlines across the country and overseas, even prompting some foreign consulates to keep a wary eye on the political wrangling.
"There is some interest, but it's purely because it has appeared in the (British) papers," said Terry Curran, the British Consul in Toronto.
Meanwhile, high-profile Canadian business leaders, politicians and artists have joined to oppose the merger plan.
They include film director Norman Jewison, Molson chief executive Norman Seagram, and writer Margaret Atwood who compared the megacity's architects to the Three Stooges.
The "No" side captured 75 percent of the votes in the referendum, but the process was flawed and turnout was low.
Under draft legislation, known as Bill 103, the seven city halls and 106 politicians who now govern the Greater Toronto Area will shrink to one elected mayor and 44 councillors.
The government also plans to overhaul property taxes, eliminate more than half of the province's school boards, seize control of education funding and download a bigger share of social programme costs onto the municipalities.
TAX FEARS
Harris has said the reforms are revenue neutral, but critics say municipalities may be forced to raise taxes.
They fear welfare rolls could soar and one of the hardest hit communities would be Toronto, which has a heavier welfare caseload and nearly half of the province's social housing.
"You're doing something that is very volatile and on a tax base which has very little flexibility," said George Fierheller, president of Toronto's Board of Trade.
More than 75 percent of the board's members favour reducing the size of government through a merger but nearly half worry about dumping such heavy responsibilities onto municipalities.
"As a Torontonian and a businessman responsible for a large company, I'm wary of abrupt change without making sure you've thought it through," said Peter Godsoe, chairman of Canada's fourth-largest bank, Bank of Nova Scotia.
The influential debt rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, has warned "the very nature and scale of the reforms...create new challenges that could affect the credit quality of some municipalities."
DOWNLOADING FEATURE OF GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS
The downloading trend has been a feature of government at all levels in Canada as they struggle with budget deficits.
Canada's ruling Liberal Party in Ottawa has dumped responsibility for public services on the provinces in recent federal budgets. Now the cash-strapped provinces are the doing the same to municipalities.
The autonomy of municipalities is severely restricted. They have the power to tax and legislate, but their powers are drawn from provincial law which can be changed by a majority vote in the legislature.
Ontario is in a tougher bind than most. Faced with a huge C$10 ($7.38) billion deficit when they came to power in 1995, the Conservatives slashed spending and cut the deficit to C$7.7 billion in 1996/97, while easing some taxes.
The Harris revolution has kept the government high in opinion polls, but public support has slipped recently, with backing for the Conservatives down to 37 percent in Metro Toronto, compared to 41 percent for the opposition Liberals.
"My sense is they cannot ignore the referendum results," said University of Toronto political scientist Graham White. "Now that doesn't mean they will abandon the bill or even change it in a substantive way. There is not a lot of room for tinkering." ($ = 1.354 Canadian Dollars)

The saga of Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and its now-worthless Busang gold find adds another chapter to a Canadian mining history rich in wealth and fiascos.
Canada has seen its share of scandals over the years -- from the 1960s Windfall affair to recent smaller busts -- but Bre-X is the most devastating to date.
The Busang discovery  -- touted by Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale "without precedent in the history of mining," said a report by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., released by Bre-X late Sunday.
"I think it's one of those things like Windfall. People will talk about it for years," veteran mine promoter Patrick Sheridan said in a recent interview.
Until now, Canada's biggest national mining scandal was the Windfall Oils and Mines Ltd. affair in the 1960s.
During a copper and zinc rush in northern Ontario, mining promoters George and Viola MacMillan acquired claims rumored to have tremendous potential.
Fueled by rumors, Windfall's stock soared to more than C$5 ($3.60) from pennies in less than a month. Authorities pressured the MacMillans to release their drilling results.
The results showed the grand deposit as a dud. The stock collapsed, and Canada's government launched a royal commission to investigate.
The Kelly Commission found no evidence the MacMillans, who carted the drill samples around in their Cadillac, were the source of the rumors. But their actions promoted a belief by investors that the samples were valuable, the commission said.
Viola MacMillan went to jail briefly for stock manipulation.
Sheridan said the panel came up with a good report on how another Windfall could be avoided. But, like many government reports, it was shelved.
The earliest dashed mining hope in Canada was in 1575 when English explorer Martin Frobisher found what he believed to be gold on Baffin Island in the far north.
When he returned to England with 1,500 tons of ore, the royal assayer told Frobisher he had worthless iron pyrites, also known as "fool's gold."
More recent mining embarassments involved Timbuktu Gold Corp. and Cartaway Resources Corp.
Last year, Timbuktu stock soared on a reported gold find in West Africa. But a new management team revealed the assays had been salted, or doctored, by unknown parties.
When investors got the news, the stock plunged around C$23 ($16) to C$1.75 ($1.27).
Cartaway stock skyrocketed in April 1996 after it announced a copper-nickel find in Labrador, Newfoundland.
The news came amid the fever over the huge Voisey's Bay nickel and copper find, which Canadian nickel giant Inco Ltd. acquired for C$4.3 billion ($3.1 billion).
Cartaway's report, however, was based on a visual inspection of just one core sample by a geologist at the site. The stock sank more than C$20 ($14) to about C$2.80 ($2).
Rich deals such as Inco's takeover of Diamond Fields Resources Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp.'s $800 million acquisition of Arequipa Resources Ltd. fueled investor enthusiasm for mining plays. But analysts said it also might have impaired the market's judgment.
"It's a symptom of the times. There is a high degree of greed in the markets, not only in the mining industry but with regard to others, and investors tend to get complacent during these times," said John Ing, president of brokerage Maison Placements Canada in Toronto.
Another Canadian mining scandal eerily similar to Bre-X involved New Cinch Uranium Ltd. and its New Mexico gold find in the 1980s.
Willroy Mines Ltd. bid for New Cinch after its stock rallied on rich assays performed by a U.S.-based lab, Chem-Tec.
But rumors about poor test results by another assayer sent the stock on a wild ride. The mob-style murder of a former Chem-Tec employee added to the intrigue.
After a negative independent audit, New Cinch admitted the samples were contaminated and several lawsuits ensued. Willroy pulled out of the project.
Today, investigators are probing the Bre-X embroglio as Canada's mining community tries to repair its tarnished image at home and abroad.
Some said the past success of Canada's other mining companies should not be tarred by controversy about one small miner.
"Our mining industry is second to none," Peter Munk, chairman of Barrick, the world's second biggest gold miner, said recently. "And no single rogue operation and no single deviant member can change these fundamentals."

Molson Cos Ltd will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, under pressure for a stock buyback as the cash-rich Canadian beer giant searches worldwide for a brewing acquisition.
It also marks the debut of a new chief executive to lead the company's return to its 210-year-old brewing roots after a failed foray into specialty chemicals.
With the C$1 billion sale of its Diversey Corp chemicals unit almost completed, Molson is looking for overseas opportunities to expand its core brewing business.  
But some investors, worried that a deal would be too pricey, are pushing the brewer for a share buyback.
"We're getting answers from across the spectrum," Brian Crombie, senior vice president of corporate finance, said of Molson's recent talks with investors.
"You've got some institutions saying they would prefer that the company buy back shares. You've got other institutions saying that they are willing to give Molson time to consider its options," Crombie said in an interview.
Molson owns 40 percent of Canada's largest brewer, Molson Breweries, which makes Molson Canadian, Golden and Red Dog.  
The rest of Molson Breweries is owned 40 percent by Australia's Foster's Brewing Group Ltd and 20 percent by Philip Morris Cos Inc's Miller Brewing unit.
Molson has expressed interest in buying a bigger stake in Molson Breweries, but neither Foster's nor Miller appears ready to part with its stake, Crombie said.
Looking offshore, analysts said good brewing assets would likely command a high price. "There's a lot of work going on, but I don't think they can make an acquisition at a reasonable price," said Mike Palmer, an analyst with Toronto-based Equity Research Associates.  
Jitters about what Molson will do with the Diversey proceeds has weighed on the brewer's share price. Molson class A stock hit a 52-week high of C$25.125 after it announced plans to sell Diversey last winter. The stock has since drifted down to about C$20.
Norman Seagram, Molson's new president and chief executive, is expected to outline his vision for the company when he addresses shareholders at the meeting in Montreal.
Seagram a former Molson executive with more than two decades of experience in the brewing industry, replaced Marshall Cohen who oversaw the company's troubled diversification.

The big U.S. mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. pulled out of the now worthless Busang gold project on Monday as Canada's mining community reeled from the biggest fraud in mining history.
New Orleans-based Freeport said a damning independent report on Busang released by Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. late on Sunday confirmed its own poor test results from the site.
"Consequently, (Freeport) will notify Bre-X that it is withdrawing from the Busang project pursuant to the terms of its contractual agreement," the company said in a statement.
The Busang discovery  -- touted by Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X as the richest find of the century -- was falsified on a scale "without precedent in the history of mining" according to the report by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd.
Strathcona said it found evidence of tampering with Bre-X's core samples and that Strathcona's own tests discovered only trace amounts of gold at the Busang site where Bre-X claimed to have found 71 million ounces of gold.
The report said a gold deposit worth mining was unlikely to be found at the site.
"We are very disappointed that the apparent opportunity for (Freeport) to develop the Busang property has been eliminated by (our) findings ... as now confirmed by the Strathcona audit report," said Freeport Chief Executive Jim Bob Moffett.
In Jakarta, an Indonesian company linked to President Suharto said it also was withdrawing from the Busang project. Nusamba Group, chaired by businessman Muhammad "Bob" Hasan, is 80 percent-owned by three charities headed by Suharto and 10 percent each by Hasan and Suharto's eldest son.
In a separate statement, Bre-X's chief of exploration, John Felderhof, said he was shocked and dismayed by the Strathcona report.
"I know that I was not involved in a fraud. I also find it very hard to believe that anyone on my staff was involved in a fraud," Felderhof said in a statement faxed from the Cayman Islands late on Sunday.
Felderhof's Busang staff included Michael de Guzman, a Bre-X geologist who allegedly jumped to his death from a helicopter on March 19 while en route to a meeting with Freeport officials in Indonesia.
On March 26, Freeport said that its preliminary tests found "insignificant" amounts of gold.
After the Freeport announcement, Bre-X immediately hired Strathcona, a well-respected Canadian mining consulting firm, to review its Busang project.
The announcements sparked panic selling of Bre-X shares, wiping almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's market value when the stock plummeted to C$2.50 ($1.80) from around C$15 ($11).
Bre-X's stock was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday after Sunday's stunning report. But shares in other small Canadian mining companies tumbled as the Bre-X scandal reverberated through the mining community.
Barry Allen, a mining analyst at Gordon Capital in Toronto, said investors would be very sceptical of future unproven discoveries by Canadian prospectors.
"Everyone will go back and re-value and re-look at everything, starting from the ground up," Allen said.
Freeport and Bre-X agreed to develop the Busang site in January after an intense bidding war by several big mining companies for control of the project.
In a deal brokered by Indonesian businessman Hasan, Freeport received a 15 percent stake and the right to mine the project. The arrangement left Bre-X with 45 percent, down from an original 90 percent stake, and the rest with the Indonesian government and the Indonesian companies.
Meanwhile, the mystery of what happened remains.
The reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Felderhof and his team of geologists, including de Guzman. The last estimate of 71 million ounces of gold was calculated by assay firm Kilborn SNC Lavalin, which has already said it was not responsible for sampling.
"I personally still believe that there are significant amounts of gold at Busang," Felderhof said in his statement, adding he would cooperate with authorities investigating the case.
Disgruntled shareholders have already launched at least eight class-action lawsuits against Bre-X and the Ontario Securities Commission is investigating Bre-X for possible violations of trading and disclosure laws.
Several books are being written about the Bre-X saga and a movie is being planned.

U.S. mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. has extended its review of a controversial Indonesian gold mining project until June 30, Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. said Wednesday.
New Orleans-based Freeport, a partner in the Busang project in Indonesia, requested the extension "to allow for consideration of the findings of the Strathcona audit," Bre-X said in a statement.
Toronto-based Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. is expected to deliver a key report on Busang to Bre-X on Thursday or Friday. Bre-X has said it will issue a press release on the report before North American financial markets open on Monday.
Rumours have swirled around Busang since what has been called the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when Freeport-McMoRan said its preliminary tests found "insignificant" amounts of gold.
Bre-X has estimated Busang contains about 71 million ounces of gold, potentially the largest in the world.
Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) from the company's stock market value last month, wiping out 80 percent of its market worth.
Freeport spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said on Wednesday the request for the extension was made within the past week.
"The original agreement with Bre-X signed on February 26 said that FCX's due diligence expired on April 30. This is really just to announce that we had pushed that date to June 30 to allow time for completion of the independent audit by Strathcona," Lemkau said in a telephone interview.
Lemkau declined to comment when asked if Freeport planned any further drilling at Busang over the next two months.
Bre-X shares led fell 32 cents Canadian (23 cents) to C$3.48 ($2.52) in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Some investors on an Internet chat page speculated that Freeport's extension was favourable to Bre-X, but mining analysts cautioned against reading too much into the announcement.
"I don't think we should read into the request, although obviously investors are," said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.
"Everybody is reading a lot into the rumours. But really they are just rumours right now," another Canadian mining analyst said.
An Indonesian newspaper, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier this week that leaked results of Strathcona's drill tests showed "cheerful" grades of gold.
But in a report in the Calgary Sun newspaper on Wednesday, Strathcona President Graham Farquharson said it was unlikely that his company's findings had been leaked.
"I still haven't seen the results myself -- the assays are still under way. So I have to doubt the claim," Farquharson was quoted as saying by the Sun. "To the best of my knowledge there've been no leaks," he said.
Strathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada, Indonesia and Australia.
Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory would have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished.
Strathcona has said its final report to Bre-X would be delivered about six weeks after an interim report.

Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd said on Tuesday a key report on the Busang gold mystery will be released before North American financial markets open on Monday.
Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., the consulting firm hired by Bre-X to audit the project, is expected to issue an interim report on its findings to Bre-X by Friday.
"Bre-X expects to release the interim report next Monday morning prior to the opening of financial markets in North America," Bre-X spokesman Richard Wool said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.
Wool said reports were wrong that Bre-X was preparing an elaborate press conference in Toronto for the announcement.
Rumors have swirled around Busang since the century's biggest gold find was cast into doubt on March 26 when partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. said its preliminary tests found "insignificant" amounts of gold.
Panic selling of Bre-X shares lopped almost C$3 billion ($2.1 billion) or 80 percent from the company's stock market value. Since then investors have anxiously awaited Strathcona's findings from Busang, once estimated by Bre-X to contain 71 million ounces of gold.
Bre-X closed up C15 cents at C$3.80 on 5.6 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
Freeport chief executive Jim Bob Moffett said on Tuesday the U.S. mining giant is hoping the Strathcona report will "add more light" to the Busang mystery.
"Freeport's participation is predicated on the fact that we will go forward and join only if we can confirm an economic deposit," Moffett said during the company's annual meeting.
The meeting was held under tight security at Freeport's New Orleans headquarters, where shareholders were screened by metal detectors and reporters were sequestered in a seperate room to view the proceedings on closed-circuit television.
While all eyes are on tiny Toronto-based Strathcona, some analysts said its report may only lead to further drilling at the Busang site.
"For anything definitive, one would expect a due diligence process that would take more than just six holes drilled by Strathcona and the seven holes (by Freeport). A lot more will have to be done before one has an idea of what is there and what isn't there," said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.
Analysts were divided on whether the granting of Indonesian contracts of work (COW) to two companies related to Bre-X was a good omen for the embattled company.
Bre-X shares soared briefly on Monday after Bro-X Minerals Ltd and Bresea Resources Ltd signed contracts to develop two copper-gold projects.
The Indonesian government has put Bre-X's COW for Busang on hold until it completed a review of the company's drilling activities.
"I know a lot of people say its irrelevant, but I just can't believe that if the Indonesians felt there was a problem with Bre-X that they would have granted them (Bro-X and Bresea) contracts of work," said Norm Duncan, a broker with Vancouver-based C.M. Oliver and Co.
Analysts questioned the accuracy of an Indonesian newspaper report on Tuesday which said leaked results of Strathcona's drill tests showed "cheerful" grades of gold.
Strathcona said last week it would maintain tight security over the assaying of its core samples at laboratories in Canada, Indonesia and Australia.
Only one or two persons in management at each laboratory will have access to the final assays and the results would not be reported until all the lab work was finished, Strathcona said last Friday.

Cobra Electronics Corp said Monday it expects to report increases in revenue and profits in 1997, after the company reported a profitable year in 1996, its first year in the black since 1989.
"We are expecting double-digit revenue growth and a significant increase in profit," chief executive officer Jerry Kalov said in an interview.
The company reported revenue of $90.3 million in 1996 and net income of $601,000 in 1996, compared to revenue of $90.4 million and a loss of $1.1 million a year ago.  
After completing a cost-cutting program in 1996, Cobra is looking to its new radar and laser detection products and a comeback in the citizens band radio market to help fuel revenue growth.
The company is currently introducing a system called Safety Alert, which expands on its radar dectector technology to allow drivers to receive a signal alerting them to emergency vehicles, oncoming trains and construction and other equipment that might cause an accident.
The company plans to sell the detector, which mounts on a windshield for about $69.95, Kalov said.  
The signal comes from a transmitter that sells for about $300 and is mounted in the light panel of emergency vehicles, he said. The company hopes municipalities will be interested in purchasing the transmitters to help avoid costly accidents to their vehicles.
"It's going to take some time, because municipalities don't have a lot of money," Kalov said about selling transmitters.
The company is also introducing a product for about $149 that combines Safety Alert, a radar detector and a system to warn drivers when police are using laser to trap speeders in an area.  
In fact, the growing use of laser by police should spur sales in the company's detection equipment, Kalov said.
"As more and more laser guns are showing up, we believe it's going to create a spurt" in laser detector sales, he said.
Cobra currently has about 15 percent of the detection market, but it expects its market share to grow to 20 to 25 percent by the end of the year, he said.
The company also has about a 35 to 40 percent market share in CB radios, its largest business. It sees that share rising to 50 percent with introduction of technology that reduces background noise and with new distribution channels.  
Kalov said use of CBs, which peaked in the 1970s, is rebounding as people become used to the mobile communications of cellular phones for emergencies but don't want to pay cellular phone charges.
CB radios also serve a "chat-room" function, allowing drivers to get recommendations for restaurants and information on road conditions, Kalov said.
The company also maintains a niche profile in the cordless telephone market with less than three percent of the market. Kalov said that the company's goal is to have three to five percent of that market.

Retailers are expected to post sales gains in the single digits for March, bolstered by low-end discount stores sales while department store performance was nearly flat compared with a year ago.
"It appears there's a slowdown in the department store end of the business, but the discounters are still doing well," Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said.
Overall, he expects comparable-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be up about 5 percent or slightly less.
An early Easter could depress sales at stores that were closed on the holiday, which fell in the March selling period instead of April this year. Winter storms in much of the northern part of the nation may have also held sales back.
"You need to look at March and April overall to get comparable sales," William Armstrong, an analyst at Fahnestock &amp; Co. Inc. said of quirks in the reporting calendar, where some retailers include Easter in March and others in April this year.
Armstrong is expecting overall retail sales for March to increase by 2 percent to 4 percent.
Most retailers will report March sales early Thursday. But Plano, Tex.-based J.C. Penney Co. Inc. Tuesday reported a 3.7 percent decline in comparable-store sales at its JCPenney stores in March. The early report was due to a debt offering the company is making this week.
The loss of one day's sales because of Easter hurt sales, J.C. Penney said.
Penney's decline is expected to be mirrored by other department stores, analysts said.
"Most (department store) chains saw flat or even slightly lower comparable sales during the March period, as they compared with healthy year-ago increases," analysts at Montgomery Securities wrote in a research report. They added that the early Easter and snowstorms in the Northeast added to pressure on sales.
At the same time, discount stores are expected to post 4 percent to 6 percent sales gains, with low-end discounters reporting low double-digit gains, Montgomery said.
"We continue to believe the low-end strata is benefitting from the fruits of a fully-employed economy and the direct pay-hike from the 1996 minimum wage increase," Montgomery's analysts wrote.
Among the major chains, analysts see Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, reporting same-store sales gains of about 7 percent. Sears, Roebuck and Co. was expected to report gains of 2 percent to 3 percent, with Kmart Corp. up 10 percent to 12 percent.
Kmart's results are expected to be driven by seasonal items, such as horticulture, home goods and bicycles. But it will give back some of those gains in April because of the calendar shift, analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a research note. Kmart stores were open on Easter, analysts added.
Dayton Hudson Corp. is expected to post a 1 percent to 2 percent gain, with a 3 percent to 4 percent increase at its Target discount stores offsetting flat department store sales. Federated Department Stores Inc. is expected to post flat sales, with some planned promotions moved into April, analysts said.

Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. will spend more than $500 million to revamp and expand its stand-alone tire and battery stores under the new National Tire and Battery name, the retailer said Wednesday.
The change is part of a plan under which Sears will spend more than $1 billion through the year 2002 on its entire auto group, adding stores and converting some existing stores.
Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears, which sold 25 million tires and 8.5 million batteries through its Sears Tire Group in 1996, will combine most of its 275 Tire America and National Tire Warehouse Stores under the National Tire and Battery name, Sears said.
The company also plans to add about 100 National Tire stores a year over the next five years, and hopes to add about $120 million in annual tire group revenue when the expansion is completed. Sears tire group had $2.3 billion in revenues in 1996.
The stores, unveiled Wednesday in Chicago, will have a high-tech, open feel, with customers able to watch the work being done on their cars. Pricing will be competitive in individual markets, Sears said.
"We will be at market pricing in every market we're in," Paul Baffico, president of Sears Automotive Group, said in an interview. "We do not necessarily want to be the market price leader, but we will be competitive with anybody who is in the market."
The stores, which will be located away from shopping malls, are geared toward a younger, higher-income customer with higher performance car needs than the 800 mall-based Sears Auto Centres, Baffico said. Because of the existence of the mall stores, the retailer chose not to include the Sears name in National Tire and Battery.
"From a location strategy standpoint, a different name allows us to be closer to a Sears store without cannabilizing the market," Baffico said.
Areas targeted for new tire stores this year are Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Rochester, N.Y. and Buffalo, N.Y.
Sears will also add a small number of Sears Auto Centre stores in malls, Baffico said.
Separately, Sears plans to spend more than $650 million to add 780 Parts America auto parts stores by the year 2002 and to transform 240 Western Auto stores to Parts America, he said.
"We should be by 2002 the clear No. 2 in parts," Baffico said. That category is currently led by Memphis, Tenn.-based AutoZone Inc., followed by Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe &amp; Jack of Philadelphia, based on revenues. Sears' parts group had $1.4 billion in revenue in 1996.
Since the parts stores do not compete with Sears' mall stores, the company will decide by the end of the summer whether to include the Sears name in the name of the stores, Baffico said.
One analyst said that Sears' expansion plans for the automotive group were aggressive, but noted that the company was being even more aggressive in other formats.
"Those are relatively aggressive, but remember they're coming from a place where they've been a little stagnant for a while," Stephen Latz, of A.G. Edwards, said of the auto group expansion plans.

The stock of Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc. jumped Monday amid speculation that Harnischfeger Industries Inc. would boost its hostile $631 million takeover offer for the supplier of machine tools or that another suitor would make a bid.
Analysts were sceptical that Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based machine tool and industrial automation products maker Giddings would see a much higher bid than the $19-a-share tender offer Harnischfeger announced Friday.
"I don't think there's much more in that Harnischfeger bid than what's in there, and I don't think there's anyone else out there" that would make a higher bid, Thomas Burns Jr., analyst at NatWest Securities, said.
The stock of Giddings, which also makes industrial automation equipment, soared $6.73 to $20.36 in active trading of more than 10.1 million shares on the Nasdaq market.
"People are expecting a higher bid," one trader said.
Harnischfeger's unsolicited bid of $19 a share for Giddings has a total value of $747 million including assumption of Giddings debt.
Giddings has asked its stockholders not to act on the offer until its board reviews the proposal. Giddings also said it retained Credit Suisse First Boston to explore all strategic alternatives.
Many analysts think that Harnischfeger's bid will prove to be successful.
While saying the Harnischfeger bid was not a done deal, "We expect (Harnischfeger) to pursue its target with vigour and would be surprised if another offer significantly higher than the one now on the table would surface," J. Blair Brumley, analyst at Dain Bosowrth Inc., said.
Harnischfeger said it is looking at using Giddings &amp; Lewis to expand in the fragmented industrial products aftermarket service business, which Harnischfeger estimates as an $80 billion market.
But some analysts said buying Giddings &amp; Lewis, a company that took a $64.1 million charge last year to try to fix its integrated automation systems business, adds a lot of uncertainty for Harnischfeger shareholders.
"...We believe that investors will be looking at a fundamentally different company with much more risk involved than they had previously," Brumley wrote in a research note, in which he also lowered the rating of Harnischfeger to a hold from a buy.
But some analysts said Harnischfeger has picked a perfect time to go after Giddings &amp; Lewis. Giddings &amp; Lewis has already taken steps to fix its underperforming operations, but the stock, in their opinion, still is ailing, they said.
"They got all the dirty work behind them," said Darren Bagwell, analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co Inc. "They've wiped the slate clean, and yet the stock price still reflects that wait and see attitude."
In fact, Bagwell also said Giddings &amp; Lewis could probably squeeze a higher bid out of somebody and said he felt the company was worth more than $19 a share.
Harnischfeger Industries stock fell $3.125 to $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Midwest regional banks should continue their trend of low double-digit earnings growth in the 1997 first quarter, with expense control, steady loan growth and share buybacks pacing results.
"We ought to see more of what we've been seeing -- slow loan growth, good expense control and share buybacks" boosting earnings per share, Michael Ancell, banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones, said.  
That earnings trend, which has been evident for Midwest banks for several quarters, is also expected to continue much of the year, even if the Federal Reserve raises rates again.
"A quarter point, or (50 basis point) or whatever higher federal funds rate doesn't make too much difference as far as what the year will look like," Thomas Maier, analyst at EVEREN Securities, said.
With adjustable rate loans and more banks deriving revenues from fees and other areas, fluctuations in interest rates have less impact on bank earnings than in the past, analysts said.  
Rising rates could pressure thrift earnings later this year, analysts warn.
"Inherently, it's much more difficult to match the rate sensitivity of both sides of their balance sheets," Ben Crabtree, analyst at Dain Bosworth, said. "They don't have much in the way of adjustable rate loans."
While earnings growth looks strong for the rest of the year for Midwest banks, analysts are eying consumer loans, including credit card loans, for signs of higher delinquencies and charge offs.  
First Chicago NBD Corp last month warned of a difficult credit environment for its card business for the rest of the year.
Credit concerns could also slow consumer loan growth, analysts noted.
"We're expecting consumer loan growth to have slowed for a number of these companies, with bankers becoming a little more gun-shy," Ancell said.
The following are first quarter mean estimates, according to First Call, compared with 1996 first quarter actual earnings:  
					 Q1 97	   Q1 96
					 ----	    -----
Banc One Corp			$0.84	   $0.77

The nation's retailers are expected to post modest sales gains for February, with warm weather during the month having a mixed impact on results, analysts said Tuesday.
Analysts said retailers are expected to post a rise of about 4 percent in sales from stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, for February.
"While warm weather, particularly in the Northeast, did boost sales of apparel at many retailers, it depressed sales in some hardline areas," analysts at Merrill Lynch said in a research note.
Most retailers are scheduled to report their February sales results Thursday morning, though Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. reported Monday that its same-store sales rose 8.2 percent for the month.
"Carsons had a strong reading, which might be a tell-tale sign for some of the smaller retailers," said Michael Niemira, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
One retailer that has exceeded the industry average in recent months, Sears, Roebuck and Co. , is expected to fall back to the pack, with gains of about 2 percent to 4 percent in sales at stores open at least a year.
"Its sales were depressed by its automotive business, which was hurt by the warm weather and hard lines, which continued their weak performance," Merrill Lynch's analysts said in the report.
Many retailers will have tough comparisons with their 1996 sales from February through the middle of spring due to warm weather a year ago, analysts said.
But one retailer that is expected to exceed the average is J.C. Penney Co. , which some analysts see posting same-store sales gains of about 9 percent.
"The (sales) numbers, I think are going to be led by Penneys in particular, which seems to have a strong reading for February," Niemira said. "Apparel is certainly helping them."
The nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., is seen posting gains of 4-6 percent, analysts said.
Electronics superstores should continue to trail the rest of the retail sector, analysts said.
Dean Ramos, with Dain Bosworth Inc., estimated that both Best Buy Co. Inc. and Circuit City Stores Inc. would report a 7 percent to 10 percent decline in same-sales for February.
"New consumer electronics products such as Digital Video Disk are not yet a factor," Ramos said in a report previewing last month's retail sales.

Harnischfeger Industries Inc. said Friday it offered to buy Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc., a Fond du Lac, Wisconsin-based maker of industrial automation products and machine tools, for about $747 million, including assumption of debt.
It said the $19-per-share offer has a value of about $747 million, based on the approximately 33.2 million shares of Giddings &amp; Lewis stock now outstanding and including the assumption of Giddings &amp; Lewis debt.
The price represents a premium of about 40 percent over Friday's closing price on Giddings &amp; Lewis's stock of $13.625 per share.
Harnischfeger Chief Executive officer Jeffery Glade said the company would have to take on "significant" debt to finance the deal, but added that financing was in place.
"It's fully financed, no contingencies," Glade said in an interview. He added that he expected the deal would add to Harnischfeger earnings immediately upon closing and that with growth, the debt would be paid down quickly.
He added that Milwaukee-based Harnischfeger would use Giddings &amp; Lewis to help improve its aftermarket service to the machine tool and material handling business.
"We'll be within 24 hours of any major plant in the United States," Glade said. "That's what happens if you put our business with ours."
Harnischfeger is not looking to cut plants or lay off employees if it succeeds in its offer, Glade said.
"What we intend to do is grow this little baby," Glade said. "We think we can sell more and become a better service provider."
The transaction would create an enterprise with combined 1996 revenues of $3.6 billion with operations in mining equipment, pulp and papermaking machinery, and industrial products and services.
Harnischfeger said it made its offer in a letter dated April 25 from Glade to Giddings &amp; Lewis President and Chief Executive Officer Marvin Isles.
Harnischfeger had been talking to Giddings &amp; Lewis about an acquisition since Monday, then made the offer Friday after receiving what it considered a rejection from Giddings &amp; Lewis' board, Glade said.
Giddings &amp; Lewis would not comment on its discussions with Harnischfeger.
In a news release late Friday, the company urged shareholders not to act on the Harnischfeger offer until its board of directors reviewed the offer and the company's alternatives.
Harnischfeger is an international holding company with businesses involved in the manufacture and distribution of equipment for underground mining, surface mining, pulp and papermaking and material handling.
Glade said Harnischfeger had alternatives to Giddings &amp; Lewis, but that Giddings &amp; Lewis was the best choice. He would not say at what price Giddings &amp; Lewis remains the best alternative. Harnischfeger shares closed at closed down $1 at $45.375 Friday.

Hyatt Hotels Corp. said Monday it will spend $1 billion over the next three years to acquire 20 to 30 hotels, rapidly accelerating its expansion programme.
Target properties will be upscale three- to five-star hotels and resorts in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean over a three-year period, said Hyatt, which is owned by Chicago's Pritzker family.
The company already has made two deals which it says are typical of the expansion plan. Last Friday, a Hyatt affiliate purchased the Grand Hyatt San Francisco, which Hyatt has managed since 1973, for $125 million plus the assumption of $5 million in debt, the company said.
On Friday, Chicago-based Hyatt will take over management of the Hotel Nikko Atlanta after acquiring the hotel in partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Partners for $90 million. The hotel will be renamed the Grand Hyatt Atlanta.
Hyatt, which operates 176 Hyatt hotels and resorts around the world, purchased 12 hotels in the past three years.
The more aggressive acquisition stance was seen by some as a response to acqusition plans by Hyatt's competitors.
"Hyatt is probably doing this to be defensive," said Burland East, analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago, noting that the move comes as other hoteliers, including Host Marriott Corp. and Hilton Hotels Corp., are looking to expand.
Hyatt's plan was made easier by a recent reorganization of some Pritzker family holdings. The family recently formed Hyatt Equities L.L.C., a real estate acquisition company that consolidates a number of the family's hotel real estate interests into one company, Hyatt said.
Hyatt Equities was created to capitalise on the equity value of the Pritzkers' hotel portfolio, allowing the company to borrow against a collection of assets instead of individual assets at more favourable interest rates.
"Hyatt Equities provides an additional vehicle through which we will grow our family's interest in Hyatt hotel real estate, enabling Hyatt to acquire hotels already managed by Hyatt as well as hotels currently managed by other hotel companies," Nicholas Pritzker, president of Hyatt Development and Hyatt Equities, said in a news release.
Hyatt Equities debt will be rated by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, and Hyatt's investment bankers anticipate strong investment-grade ratings Hyatt said.
Hyatt said that, as a private company, Hyatt Equities is able to use a broader set of transaction structures than is typically available to public companies, real estate investment trusts or acquisition funds.
Among real estate investment trusts that could wind up competing with Hyatt for upscale properties are Dallas-based Patriot American Hospitality Inc. and Phoenix-based Starwood Lodging Trust, East said.
"At the margins, 30 hotels is meaningful," East said of the impact of Hyatt's plan on the hotel landscape. "Is it earth-shattering? No."

Caterpillar Inc. reported a first quarter profit of $394 million Tuesday, the best quarter in the company's history and up 33 percent from a year ago.
Caterpillar also said it now expects 1997 profits will be higher than the $1.4 billion it posted in 1996, based on expectations for "moderately higher" sales.
The outlook is a switch from January, when Caterpillar forecast profits near 1996 levels.
The Peoria, Ill.-based heavy equipment maker reported earnings of $394 million, or $2.08 a share, well above the Wall Street consensus of $1.69 a share. Sales and revenues were $4.26 billion.
A year earlier, Caterpillar earned $296 million, or $1.53 a share, on revenues of $3.84 billion.
"This is just a very, very solid operating quarter," J. Blair Brumley, an analyst who follows Caterpillar at Dain Bbosworth Inc., said.
Gross profit margins helped drive earnings in the quarter, rising to 26.8 percent of machinery and engine sales from 24.5 percent a year ago.
The rise in profit margins was primarily due to higher prices, higher physical sales volume, a favourable change in geographic sales mix, lower sales discounts and the net effect of the stronger dollar.
But the favourable effect of the stronger dollar on costs incurred in Japanese yen and European currencies was substantially offset by the negative impact on prices.
Sales inside the United States were $2.17 billion, up 15 percent from a year ago. Sales outside the United States were $1.90 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago.
Sales volume in the quarter was up 9 percent, while prices improved 2 percent, Caterpillar said.
While results were far better than expected for the quarter, analysts expressed some concern about how much the stronger dollar aided results.
Caterpillar also hedged its forecast for the year, saying greater-than-expected interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and lingering weakness in European demand could hurt results.
Also, if the dollar remains too strong vs. the yen, the company could be forced to cut prices because of competition from Japanese companies, Caterpillar said.
Caterpillar noted that the economic and industry outlook improved from January because the United States and Canada are now expected to have better economic growth and higher machine industry demand than originally anticipated.
The company said it expected U.S. gross domestic product to rise 3 percent in 1997, up from the 2 percent it expected earlier. Caterpillar shares rose $2.25 to $81.625 Tuesday.

With Mercury Finance Co in talks to secure long-term financing and no fresh disclosures about the consumer finance company emerging, investors have started to come back to the stock.
"I think the stock is moving up because of time here," Michael Durante, senior specialty finance analyst at Prudential Securities, said on Wednesday. "With each passing day, the company looks to be more and more stable."  
No word has surfaced about any fresh adverse findings since Mercury appointed Arthur Andersen LLP as its auditor on February 18, Durante said, though the audit of 1996 results was still incomplete.
"I think indications are so far that nothing new has been found over and above what Peat Marwick found, which is good news," Durante said, referring to KPMG Peat Marwick, the company's former auditor.
A Mercury spokesman said the auditors declined to say exactly when they would finish their work.  
Meanwhile, Mercury this week has tried to secure long-term financing from lenders. The spokesman could not say how successful those talks have been.
On January 29, Mercury said accounting discrepancies were discovered, causing it to restate its results to show earnings over four years were $90 million less than previously reported.
Since then, Mercury has defaulted on millions of dollars of debt. It was served with a search warrant by FBI agents seeking financial records and hired a new chief executive officer. The company was also named as a defendant in more than half a dozen lawsuits related to the misstated earnings.  
The company lost more than $2 billion in market capitalization when its share price plunged after the disclosure of the erroneous financial information.
But in recent days, the stock has moved higher in active trading. After falling to as low as 1-1/2 on January 31 from 14-7/8 before the disclosures, Mercury was up 1/4 at 3-5/8 in early afternoon trading on Wedesday. More than 12 million shares changed hands.
Durante said the company had a liquidation value of $3-$4 a share, barring any new disclosures, while its value as a going concern was in the high single digits.
But other analysts were not as sanguine about Mercury's value. Katrina Blecher, an analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co, recommended investors sell at the stock's current level.
"On a fundamental basis, which is difficult at best to garner given the state of unaudited and/or unavailable specifics, we feel the company is fully valued," Blecher wrote in a research report Wednesday.

Amazon.com Inc., an online bookseller, is one of the best-known retailers on the Internet but faces a harsh investment climate and tough competition as it plunges into the stock market, industry analysts said Tuesday.
The rapidly growing Seattle-based company filed documents on Monday to sell about 10 percent of the company in an offering projected to raise up to $33 million.
That gives the company a market value of about $300 million despite a reported net loss of $5.8 million last year on sales of only $15.7 million.
While Amazon.com long has been considered a likely candidate for a public offering, some analysts were surprised by the timing, noting that technology stocks in general and Internet startups in particular have been hammered in recent months.
Some analysts speculated that Amazon.com decided to jump in now because of rising competition from bookselling giants Borders Group Inc. and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc., among others.
"I certainly think it's possible it came sooner rather than later because of the entry of those other players into that market," said Scott Smith, director of the digital commerce group at Jupiter Communications.
The competition already has sparked a price war, forcing Amazon.com to offer its 500 top titles at a 40 percent discount to list price, slashing its slim profit margins.
Smith and other analysts give Amazon.com high marks for identifying and exploiting a niche that seems particularly appropriate for online commerce.
"They can definitely make money at this," said Bill Bass, an analyst with Forrester Research. "The interesting thing will be to see how much of the market they'll be able to capture."
Amazon.com advertises itself as "Earth's Largest Bookstore" with an "inventory" of virtually all 1.5 million English-language books in print plus about 1 million out-of-print books, compared with about 200,000 titles at a typical superstore.
In fact Amazon.com keeps no more than a few thousand books on hand at its Seattle warehouse at any time, relying on its relationships with major distributors and publishers to order titles as needed and keep overhead low.
Jeff Bezos, the 33-year-old founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, said the secret to the company's success was its ability to develop strong relationships with customers.
"We are incredibly customer-obsessed," Bezos said Tuesday at PC Forum, a high-level industry conference in Tucson, Ariz.
"The Web is really primitive at this point," he said. "You have to make every customer an evangelist."
The company's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said repeat customers account for more than 40 percent of its business.
"I think it's absolutely possible to make money on the Web," Bezos said, while declining to comment specifically on the company's financial results. "You can sell products at lower prices and have higher margins with much lower overhead."
But Manesh Shah, publisher of IPO Maven, said the market has not been kind to Internet stocks since last summer, when momentum began shifting to large-capitalization issues.
"The market has been very negative on small-cap IPOs," he said. "I think they are hoping sometime between now and the end of the summer they get a window to get in."
Well-known Internet startups such as CNET Inc. and Yahoo Inc. have swung wildly, while Wired Ventures was forced to withdraw its planned offering due to a lack of interest.
Yahoo, which has never matched its peak of $43 a share attained on its first day of trading last year, currently trades around $28. CNET has fallen from as high as $35.75 this year to $24.50 Tuesday.
Even mighty Microsoft Corp. has seen its stock price slip 12 percent in recent weeks.
"Overall the sentiment is quite negative," Shah said.

Boeing Co. stock surged Tuesday after the company decided to scrap plans to build a costly stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet.
Boeing shares jumped $5.625 to a record $112.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, accounting for much of the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is one of 30 stocks in the index of blue-chip companies.
Industry analysts estimated the move by the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, announced late on Monday, could reduce Boeing's research and development costs by more than $2 billion over the next five years and boost annual earnings by as much as $1 a share.
NatWest Securities analyst Nick Heymann said the decision not to proceed with the risky project removed a cloud of uncertainty over Boeing as it ramps up production to meet rising demand and prepares to complete its planned $14 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
"It's fantastic news," he said.
While officials at Boeing rival Airbus Industrie said the European consortium would go ahead with plans for an all-new superjumbo jetliner called the A-3XX, Heymann said he thought that project was dead.
"Airbus never really had the resources to go ahead with their aircraft," Heymann said.
He said it was even less likely the European consortium could raise the funds now that Boeing has talked with the same customers and determined market conditions did not justify the investment needed for a new big jet.
Boeing said it would cost more than $7 billion just to develop a new wing and make other changes needed to produce two new versions of the 747 that would add range and capacity.
Airbus has said it can develop and all-new jet for $8 billion, but analysts peg the total costs at closer to a whopping $15 billion.
Citing increasing "route fragmentation," especially across the Pacific Ocean, Boeing said it plans to focus its development efforts on new versions of the medium-sized 767 and 777 twin-engine models.
Boeing already has begun offering an increased-capacity version of the 767 that could be launched with an initial order in the next few months.
Boeing also is considering new versions of the 777 that would add both capacity and range.
Heymann said Boeing also plans minor changes in the 747 including new digital cockpit electronics and computer software. The revamped plane would be the same size with the same range as the current 747-400, Boeing's latest version of the four-engine plane.
Alfred Goldman, a stock market analyst at brokers A.G. Edwards and Sons, said the rise in Boeing stock accounted for nearly half of the Dow's rise of about 34 points, to 6,878, at midday.

Microsoft Corp.'s 4-month-old Expedia Internet travel service sold more than $1 million in travel tickets this week, its best ever, executives said Friday.
Josh Herst, lead product manager for Expedia, said business has been building but enjoyed a flurry of sales this week when American Airlines launched a fare war after President Clinton blocked a strike by its pilots.
"We had a nice spike," he said. "If they wanted to have more of those, we wouldn't complain."
Herst said Microsoft is investing heavily in the travel arena, seen as a potentially lucrative form of electronic commerce.
Forrester Research analyst Bill Bass said travel generated $126 million in retail sales over the Internet in 1996, second only to computer software and hardware, which generated $140 million.
By 2000, the travel industry will generate $1.6 billion in annual sales over the Internet, Forrester estimates.
"Airline tickets are a great thing to be able to buy online," Bass said. "You don't have to hold it -- it's not like clothes, where it helps to be able to see it and touch it."
Bass also said travel sites on the Internet are able to include related information such as maps and hotel listings that would be impossible to provide over the telephone.
Microsoft is far from the only company seeking a piece of the Internet travel market, but analysts give Expedia high marks so far and say Microsoft is likely to remain one of the major players.
Other online travel agencies include Travelocity, operated by American Airlines' parent company AMR Corp., Preview Travel and Internet Travel Network.
Airlines themselves also operate sites, which have proven to be an excellent way to sell seats that would otherwise go empty, Bass said. American Airlines has sold $10 million in tickets in the past year through a weekly electronic mail bulletin offering discount seats for weekend travel on lightly booked flights, he said.
Herst said Microsoft has about 100 people working on Expedia, including journalists building a database of information about destinations. The service plans to add several "big-name columnists" soon, said Erik Blachford, Expedia product manager.
Microsoft is believed to keep slightly less than the usual 10 percent travel agent's commission, and it has a relationship with Worldspan Travel Partners in Atlanta to print and mail tickets and provide 24-hour telephone support for travelers.
Microsoft also expects to generate substantial advertising revenue, Herst said.
While Expedia is designed for individuals and small businesses, Microsoft also is working with American Express Co. on a related project to develop a corporate travel application.

Starbucks Corp. executives Thursday lashed out at critics of the company's coffee buying practices, saying the retailer has been targeted unfairly because of its high visibility.
At the company's annual shareholders meeting, Chairman Howard Schultz heatedly defended the coffee chain's commitment to improve the lot of the Third World farmers who grow most of the beans it roasts and sells.
Schultz threatened to stop buying Guatemalan coffee entirely if activists continues to pummel Starbucks with what he called "propaganda" about its role in conditions endured by agricultural labourers there.
"We are doing everything possible to be a great corporate citizen, but we are only one company," Schultz said. "We can't change the entire physical, political and agricultural system of an entire country overnight."
Schultz clearly was stung by a coalition of labour, human rights and religious activists who launched a campaign on the eve of the annual meeting to complain Starbucks was not doing enough to change a system that pays workers far less than a reasonable living wage.
"We're the only company that has given back to Guatemala, and we are the ones being hounded," said Schultz.
Schultz pointed out that Starbucks had donated $300,000 to the aid group CARE last year to help workers in Guatemala and three other coffee-growing nations and had established a partnership with Appropriate Technology International to help small-scale producers in Central America.
He said the non-profit groups were the best way for the company to effect change because Starbucks does not itself have any coffee farms and typically buys its beans from exporters rather than producers.
Bruce Herbert, director of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, said he and other activists recognised Starbucks' positive contributions but wanted the company to live up to the code of conduct it approved two years ago as a framework for helping coffee workers.
"No one has ever put a timeline on it, but two years have passed and they haven't taken the first steps," he said.
At a news conference after the meeting, Schultz said the company was expanding its charitable efforts by establishing the Starbucks Foundation, which will support aid projects in the cities where the coffee chain operates.
The Foundation will get all royalties and a $500,000 advance from a book by Schultz on the Starbucks way of doing business to be published in September.
Schultz also said market coffee prices that have doubled over the past several months were a source of "great concern," but he said he was confident that company would work through the volatiliy and meet Wall Street earnings estimates for the current fiscal year.
He said the company would make an announcement on its strategy regarding the price issue within the next several days, but he declined to say whether Starbucks would raise retail prices.
Dave Olsen, senior vice president for coffee, said market supply and demand were not far out of balance but a decision by large buyers to go short on the commodity had created a huge "bow wave" of buying, compounded by speculative volatility.

Advanced Technology Laboratories Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Fill said Wednesday he was comfortable with estimates the company will earn between $1.30 and $1.40 a share this year.
Fill also said in an interview that earnings of $1.85 a share for 1997, the consensus estimate of industry analysts according to I/B/E/S, are "within our reach."
The manufacturer of medical ultrasound equipment, also known as ATL, earned $0.74 a share last year.  
Fill spoke to Reuters after a presentation at a brokerage conference in New York, where he said the company was on track to achieve its goal of a 15 percent return on shareholders' equity by the end of 1998.
Fill said that after several turbulent years the medical-device industry is stabilizing, although he did not see any significant growth in the U.S. ultrasound market before 1998.  While the U.S. ultrasound market is flat and the European market is growing at a slow three to five percent a year, ATL sales are growing by about six to seven percent annually, he said.  
"So we are continuing to take market share," Fill said.
In April, ATL's ultrasound imaging product became the first medical device ever to win premarket approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in diagnosing breast cancer, Fill said.
He said he expected the agency to act in the next several weeks on its supplemental request for approval of the next-generation HDI 3000 machine.
In addition to breast cancer, Fill said the company's equipment increasingly is being used as a lower-cost alternative to magnetic resonance imaging for muscular-skelatal problems and for heart patients.
And he said the company sees promising opportunities in Asia and Latin America, where industry growth rates are in the "low double digits."
He said a venture with Japan's Hitachi Medical Corp aimed at penetrating the Japanese market probably will begin producing significant results beginning next year.

Software giant Microsoft Corp.'s stock dropped more than 4 percent Monday amid indications that a successor to the Windows 95 operating system will be delayed until 1998.
The stock fell $3.875 to $90.125 and was the most active issue on Nasdaq after widespread reports that the Windows 95 update, code-named Memphis, probably would not be released this year as previously anticipated.
Industry analysts said the likely delay of the operating system update would have little financial impact on Microsoft but could reflect a diminishing corporate appetite for frequent software upgrades.
"For large organisations, every year and a half to two years is too fast for new versions," said David Rothschild of brokerage Piper Jaffray. "Every three or four years is more like it."
Analysts said the delay likely stemmed from the difficulty of integrating into the operating system the upcoming version 4.0 of Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.
Jonathan Roberts, director of Windows product management for Microsoft, declined to project a release date for Memphis but said computer manufacturers had been told they would not get software code in time for holiday season retail shipments.
He added that it would be "desirable" to synchronize the retail release of the software to coincide roughly with shipments of new computers.
Roberts said developers still expected to issue the first major beta test version to customers by June 30 but said computer manufacturers that sell in major retail outlets generally need final code by July to ship for the holiday season.
The Windows 95 update, sometimes referred to as Windows 97 or Windows 9x, will include several performance-related features, most of which are ready. But developers are still working on the new Internet browser, which adds "push" technology and comes hard on the heels of version 3.0 of the browser, a major update released in August.
In "push" technology, computer users can have customised information sent to them over the Internet rather than having to go out on the Net and search for it.
Widely publicised security flaws discovered recently in Internet Explorer 3.0 might be part of the reason Microsoft has decided to go slow with the operating system update, some analysts said.
"It's fair to say Internet Explorer got a fair amount of heat for the security problem," said Larry Dietz of Zona Research, an analyst at Zona Research.
But he also said Microsoft could be "throttling back a little" because of resistance to frequent upgrades from corporate users.
"Large end-users are in no hurry to spend the dollars," Dietz said. "Most end-users know there is a tremendous amount of down time that exists any time you putter with people's computers."
Microsoft's Roberts acknowledged that many corporate users are still making the transition to Windows 95.
Piper Jaffray's Rothschild said the Memphis delay would be unlikely to affect Microsoft's earnings or revenues significantly, particularly because the company defers much of the income it gets from operating systems.
But he and other analysts noted the company's stock is still relatively high priced compared with its expected growth.
"It's an expensive stock, and whenever you get a whiff of bad news, it's going to behave like this," said Mike Wallace of UBS Securities. "I dont think it's a big deal."
Microsoft, which has slipped about 13 percent from its peak of $103.50 in early February, was one of many high-technology stocks that slumped Monday.
While the shipping date has slipped, Microsoft needs to update the operating system soon if only because its very name advertises the fact that Windows 95 is nearly 2 years old, analysts said.
In addition, Microsoft's financial model requires it to maintain a regular stream of upgrade revenues, said Michael Gartenberg, research director of the Gartner Group consulting and research firm.
He predicted the Memphis system would get a less historically specific name -- perhaps Windows 2000 -- and said Microsoft probably would increase the price for the new operating system relative to that for Windows 95.
Roberts declined to comment on the naming or pricing of the product.

Continuing its sweeping effort to acquire key Internet technology, Microsoft Corp. said Monday it had purchased Interse Corp., a privately held developer of Web site analysis software.
Terms of the deal for the 30-person Sunnvale, Calif.-based company were not disclosed.
A Microsoft executive said Interse's market focus tool would be added quickly to the software giant's BackOffice line of server products, but details of how the software will be repackaged had not been worked out.
Interse market focus, which ranges in price from $695 to $6,995 depending on features, allows Web site operators to track visitor behaviour.
"Understanding usage patterns on your Web site is the best way to see what your customers are interested in so you can deliver the most targeted content," Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates said in a statement. "Interse is the team that had this vision and is delivering on it."
"It's really a comprehensive usage analysis and reporting solution," said Terry Myerson, president and chief executive officer of Interse, who along with some other of the company's employees will be joining Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft.
He said in an interview that he would continue to work on the technology with the aim of being able to dynamically create customised Web pages based on a user's known preferences.
"That is the holy grail of what this medium wants to be," said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst with MecklerMedia Corp. "What it's all about really is what I call the 'me-net.'"
While Microsoft probably could have developed its own solution, the compressed product cycles of "Internet time" have spurred the company to buy dozens of small startups over the past year to ensure it does not fall behind competitors.
"Every day that goes by when you don't have a solution, you're that much more open to a competitor gaining a strong market hold," Harmon said.
With its buoyant stock and $9 billion in cash, Microsoft can afford to be generous.
"All of our employees were taken care of terrifically," Interse's Myerson said. "It was a very positive experience."

Boeing Co. may take over maintenance operations for some of its airline customers as part of a drive by the jet manufacturer to develop new business opportunities, a company spokeswoman said Friday.
Boeing Enterprises, a new division of the company's commercial airplane group, is looking at maintenance as "one of many" new business opportunities, spokeswoman Barbara Murphy said.
"There are things that make it very logical for us to pursue this new business opportunity," she said. "We have an advantage. We know our airplanes better than anyone."
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Boeing was pushing to take over the heavy-maintenance operations of several major carriers, possibly including British Airways Plc.
Murphy declined to comment on any specific deals, and a spokeswoman for British Airways also declined comment.
Industry analysts said a move by Boeing into maintenance would make sense as a way to diversify the company's business beyond highly cyclical airplane manufacturing and weapons systems.
"If you can get into that business without stepping on your customer's toes I think it's a great idea," said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.
He and other analysts said the move was a reflection of Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit's efforts to diversify Boeing while the manufacturer is enjoying a record wave of new orders.
"This is a reflection of Phil Condit and his more aggressive nature than his predecessor and a reflection of the internal thinking that's going on as to where best could they deploy the huge amount of cash they're going to have on hand," said Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
Boeing had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of last year, and Nisbet estimated that with the company's expected acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. this year it will generate at least $1.5 billion in excess cash annually over the next several years.
Last month Boeing Enterprises announced a $200 million joint venture with FlightSafety International to offer pilot and ground crew training. FlightSafety is a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
The Boeing unit, formed in January, also has been exploring ways to profitably use the company's massive database of world airline inventories to help carriers maintain service records.
Boeing was off $1.75 at $100.375 on the New York Stock Exchange amid a drop of 148 points, or more than 2 percent, in the Dow Jones industrial average.

Boeing Co.'s engineers union said Wednesday it has filed a charge of unfair labour practices over the aerospace giant's decision to merge its training unit into a new venture with FlightSafety International.
The Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Assocation, which represents more than 23,000 mostly white-collar workers at Boeing, said it filed a complaint asking the National Labour Relations Board to prevent Boeing from completing its deal until the legal issues are resolved.
Charles Bofferding, executive director of SPEEA, said the union had begun negotiations with Boeing after being surprised by the March 10 announcement of the deal with FlightSafety, which affects more than 600 Boeing employees, including about 240 union members.
Under the deal, Boeing and FlightSafety, a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., each would contribute $100 million in assets to create an international training company for commercial jet pilots and ground crews.
Bofferding said Boeing already has agreed to guarantee that employees will be offered other jobs at Boeing if they do not get similar positions in the new venture, known as FlightSafety Boeing Training International.
But he was not optimistic Boeing would agree to union demands that engineers who switch to the new venture will be allowed to keep their Boeing wages and benefits as well as union membership.
"Those two issues frankly we don't think we're going to clear up in negotiations," Bofferding said. "It's very clear the company wants to give these people FlightSafety International benefits and strip away these people's union representation."
A Boeing official said in a statement the company was "disappointed" the union felt a need to file the charge with the NLRB.
"We recognise our obligation to engage in these discussions with the union and welcome the opportunity to do so," said the official, Sants Contreras.  "We have worked very hard over the last three years to build a strong, cooperative relationship with SPEEA, and we hoped to have more time to meet with the union on their concerns before they took this type of action."
The two sides will meet again Friday to continue their negotiations.

Boeing Co. said Tuesday it formed an entrepreneurial organisation that will seek out joint ventures and possibly acquisitions related to its core business of commercial airplanes.
Boeing senior vice president of planning and international development Lawrence Clarkson will serve as president of the new organisation, Boeing Enterprises, which will be part of Boeing's commercial airplane group.
In an interview, Clarkson said the unit was aggressively seeking out "very significant" projects and could grow rapidly in the next year.
Clarkson declined to be specific about ongoing negotiations but indicated they probably would not involve new airplane models.
Instead, he said Boeing would seek out opportunities in "businesses that are very related to what Boeing does, but which up to now we've let other people do."
For example, Boeing executives in the past have discussed taking advantage of the company's massive database of world airline inventories to help carriers maintain service records, a business Clarkson said would fall within the new unit.
Boeing Enterprises also will be responsible for the company's joint venture with General Electric Co. to market the 737 as a business jet.
Clarkson said formation of the unit had been discussed for some time and was unrelated to Boeing's planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
"The idea is to have a basically independent operation so we don't get tied down with the existing bureaucracy," he said.
He said some of the prospective joint ventures could have "significant" international components, particularly focusing on the Asia-Pacific region.
Boeing is continuing to study the possibility of working with Asian manufacturers to build a new small jet that would seat about 100 passengers, but Clarkson said he did not expect any decisions in the near future.
Clarkson said he expected any acquisitions would be profitable immediately.
"The basic objective here is to increase shareholder value and grow the company, so obviously we want it to be as profitable as possible," he said.
A decision on Clarkson's replacement in planning and international development will be made in the near future, the company spokeswoman said.
Clarkson, 58, came to Boeing in 1987 from engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp.
After serving as a senior vice president in the commercial airplane group, Clarkson was promoted to his position in Boeing headquarters, which The New York Times descibed as "the closest thing it has to a corporate secretary of state."
"I think I'll still have to use some of those skills, but it's kind of nice to get into more of a line operation and something new," Clarkson said.
Clarkson will retain his title as one of only six Boeing senior vice presidents.

Western mines and financiers have not taken a shine to Russia's big gold reserves, saying it will be some time before the world's third-largest gold producer attracts significant foreign investment.
"A lot of companies have come, looked and are here to look again, but it's going to be slow, very slow," said Ted Reeve, gold equity analyst at Toronto-based Scotia Capital Markets.
"There's competition for exploration and investment dollars, and Russia is certainly not getting her share of them," he said, speaking on Tuesday at a Russian-Canadian industry seminar.
Russia ranks third in the world in terms of gold reserves, but only fifth in output and far lower in outside investment.
Industry sources said not one of the dozen or so top joint ventures in Russia had produced even one tonne of gold since launching operations in recent years.
"It's too early," said Pas Gido, a board member of Baleyzoloto, a Canadian-Russian project near Chita in Siberia, adding that the lead time for gold projects here was five years.
Viktor Gritsayev, a deputy head of the state committee for precious metals and stones (Komdragmet), whose functions are being transferred to other state entities, said Russia had targeted $6 billion in investment for its gold sector by 2000, with 43 percent of the total to come from foreign investors.
But if last year is any sign of things to come, the short-term outlook is not good.
Industry sources said a mere $45 million was invested in Russian gold projects last year -- a tiny fraction of the total $3.6 billion spent last year by global investors, half of them Canadian or U.S., on gold projects around the world.
Sergei Kyshtymov, head of the central bank's precious metals department, said 108 domestic banks had licenses to finance gold output. But industry sources said only eight banks can take gold out of the country as collateral to finance projects and that domestic financing had yet to increase output.
"Unfortunately, there really have not been any significant structural changes in financing," said Mikhail Katsman, executive director of Russia's Union of Gold Producers, a non-government organisation.
About 85 percent of all gold mined in Russia last year was from above-ground alluvial, or placer, deposits, as opposed to below-ground ore deposits. But since 80 percent of Russia's known gold reserves are in the ground, big investment dollars will be needed soon if output is to increase significantly.
Output last year fell to about 122 tonnes, largely because alluvial reserves are being depleted, taxes hit producers at 60 percent of revenues and state funding has declined.
State forecasts say 1996 output is likely to slip further.
Nearly two thirds of the country's gold is mined in Russia's Far East, a quarter comes out of Eastern Siberia and 12 percent out of the Urals, with small cooperatives, known as artels, accounting for about 60 percent of output.
In one of Russia's best-known projects and the one analysts say is the furthest along, Cyprus Magadan Gold, a unit of Amax Gold Inc, owns a 50 percent stake in the Omolon Gold Mining Company project to develop the Kubaka reserve in the Far Eastern Magadan region.
Output, expected to begin in 1997, is targeted at an annual average rate of 310,000 ounces of gold and 235,000 ounces of silver over seven years.
But other projects have stumbled or worse.
Britain's RTZ Corp Plc pulled out of its only Russia project in May over royalty and tax squabbles with Moscow.
"If I were a foreign company, I would see a tonne of problems to foreign investment in Russian gold," Katsman said.

Russia sold platinum, palladium and diamonds in 1995 and 1996, apparently to save its economy from ruin, but the near-depletion of strategic gold stockpiles does not point to big bullion exports, officials said Friday.
The sales were well above planned levels, but the news has not shed much light on the exact size of secret stocks of precious metals and diamonds in Russia, which holds the key to world markets and is a major supplier.
But a Central Bank official said gold had not been exported. "Gold is not leaving the country," deputy press director Natalya Khomenko said.
She said strategic reserves were nearly empty, not because they had been exported, but because the bank had bought them.
The bank's gold reserves, used to defend the ruble and kept separately from strategic stocks, were 400 tons, she said.
The size of Russia's precious metals stockpiles, especially platinum, is of major interest to world metals markets, and Moscow's gold sales have in the past moved prices furiously.
But platinum, palladium and diamond reserves are a fiercely guarded state secret, so clues are welcome.
A senior source at Russia's Audit Chamber said Russia sold gems and precious metals in higher than planned quantities in 1995 and 1996. The source told Reuters that 1995 exports of precious metals and diamonds were 50 percent above the 4.6 trillion rubles ($1 billion at end-1995 exchange rates) planned in the budget.
He said 1996 sales were twice the planned level of 4.5-4.6 trillion rubles (then worth about $800 million).
"They would seem to be pretty authoritative numbers, given that they're coming from the audit office," said one European metals analyst.
Andy Smith of UBS in London urged caution. "Confusion, uncertainty, grain of salt -- those are the key words. Again, we don't know what the starting point was, truth be told."
The Audit Chamber is a little-known, powerful independent body responsible for checking how revenue and expenditure targets in the budget and at state organisations are met.
"What it boils down to is that the sales are probably not great news for the government, because it shows that they need to find all the cash they can get," said mining specialist Raj Kohli at Paribas Capital Markets in London.
Russia is one of the world's top producers of platinum and its sister-metal, palladium. Its gold reserves in the ground are the world's third-largest, while its rough diamonds accounted for about one-quarter of De Beers annual sales of rough gems.
A second Audit Chamber source said Russia's diamond stockpile could run out between March 1998 and September 1998 unless it were replenished.
Russia's gem mines require vast investment.
The extra gem and metals sales in 1995 and 1996 took place as Russia, struggling to revive its economy and breathe life into market reforms, sought to cover budget revenue shortfalls. Metals analysts in London and Johannesburg have long believed that Russia has been selling platinum and palladium stockpiles to earn much-needed foreign currency.

Russia's LUKoil, one of the world's biggest oil companies, will increasingly take its upstream business out of Siberia and into the Caspian and Gulf, in a move reflecting the tough economics of production at home.
LUKoil's strategy underscores the problems of producing oil in Russia, where expensive, hard-to-recover reserves, limp domestic demand and a struggling economy make exports and foreign projects the only ways to earn substantial profits.
"I can tell you we're not really interested in raising our oil output in Russia, and for three reasons -- pipeline capacity limits, small export terminals and low domestic demand," LUKoil spokesman Pyotr Neyev said in a brief telephone interview.
LUKoil heads into its shareholders' meeting on Thursday ready to put what Neyev said were net cash profits according to Russian standards of 3.87 trillion roubles ($673 million) to work on projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Iraq.
A second spokesman, Alexander Vasilenko, said LUKoil -- which says it has the most crude oil reserves of any traded oil company in the world -- aimed to produce at least one quarter of its oil outside Russia at the beginning of the next millenium.
"LUKoil does admit they're not investing much in their West Siberia operations," said Renaissance brokerage energy analyst Alexei Kokin. "They have too many undiversified costs there, and they're relocating fronts."
Among LUKoil's major non-Russia projects are a 52.5 percent stake in a $4 billion, 23-year production-sharing project in Iraq's Western Qurnah; a 12.5 percent stake in an $8 billion international Azeri Caspian project that is the largest foreign investment deal in the former Soviet Union; and significant stakes in two other Azeri projects.
It is set to receive a five percent stake in Chevron Corp's and Mobil Corp's Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, and has a $5.2 billion, 18-year joint venture agreement with Atlantic Richfield (ARCO), which owns eight percent of Russia's largest vertically-integrated oil firm.
It is also eyeing Algeria, and has a deal with Italy's Agip Spa to look at North African projects.
"I think the strategy is a correct one -- but it's not an easy one to copy," said a Western energy consultant, adding that LUKoil President Vagit Alekperov, half-Azeri and born in Baku, had connections to Caspian oil that other oil bosses did not.
Russian oil producers make no money on domestic production not exported and by some estimates earn 80-90 percent of their profits from sales abroad and the remainder from regional sales of refined oil products.
Output and transport costs for Western Siberia, where three-quarters of LUKoil's 10.7 billion barrels in proven reserves are located, are about $6 per barrel, Kokin said, compared to estimates of $2 per barrel in the Caspian.
"Generally, the domestic Russian oil business is loss-making," said the Western analyst. "You get some earnings in regional distribution (of refined products like gasoline). But selling crude to Russian refineries or on the Russian spot market is loss-making."
Despite an aggressive expansion programme, LUKoil, which accounted for nearly 20 percent of Russian oil production last year with output of 1.16 million barrels per day, sees home production rising by 2.4 percent this year.
Most Russian oil companies face similar problems, and are struggling to turn the tide against output declines while calculating the value of increased output against export pipelines already filled to the limit.
But LUKoil, a favourite among foreign portfolio investors, in part due to its success in consolidating control over its production units, refiners and distributers, is the exception, not the rule, among Russia's newly-privatised oil companies.
"LUKoil's move abroad is correct," said the Western analyst. "But its Russian competitors will not be able to do the same."

Russia removed a layer of secrecy from its huge Sukhoi Log gold field and invited investors on Thursday to tap the Siberian El Dorado, which could significantly boost Russian gold output for years to come.
But there was little chance that developing the vast field would flood markets with Russian gold, even if the long-stalled, long-delayed billion-dollar project gets off the ground soon.
"Sukhoi Log may be the biggest hard-rock reserve, but Busang in Indonesia, which is open-pit, has 75 million ounces and rising," said Andy Smith of UBS in London, discounting Russian talk that Sukhoi Log was the world's largest untapped gold field.
An aide at the Natural Resources Ministry said domestic miner Lenzoloto would tender next month a 49 percent stake in one of its units which holds the right to develop Sukhoi Log.
Small Australian miner Star Mining Corporation NL, with nominally 31 percent of Lenzoloto, was the preferred bidder, Lenzoloto board secretary Alexei Mikhailov said.
Sukhoi Log -- which means Dry Ravine in Russian -- is in southeastern Siberia's remote Irkutsk region and has gold reserves of about 35 million troy ounces, Mikhailov said.
Lenzoloto produced about five tonnes of gold last year, a drop in the bucket of Russia's 1996 total of 124 tonnes.
Mikhailov said Sukhoi Log's peak output could reach 60 tonnes a year (nearly two million ounces) in the next millenium -- a figure which did not make analysts jump.
"Sixty tonnes of output can be bought in five minutes by a fund," Smith said, adding that mine supply variations had not really affected gold prices in the past year and the chances of Russia flooding the market with Sukhoi Log gold were "nil".
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin ordered last year that Russia stop hiding how much gold Sukhoi Log might have, saying decades-long Soviet secrecy on the giant field would do nothing to attract the vast amount of capital needed to tap it.
Mikhailov said platinum reserves there could be as high as gold reserves but said it was unclear if they could be commercially developed.
A feasibility study of Sukhoi Log has been completed but Mikhailov said Lenzoloto had not yet seen the document. The study details gold-recovery grades ascertained by Russian geologists and guarded as a secret by the Soviet Communists.
"We have 51 percent of the shares (in Lenzoloto unit Sukhoi Log that will tap the field) and fully control the situation," Boris Yatskevich, First Deputy Natural Resources Minister and Lenzoloto board chairman, told the Sevodnya daily.
"They will pay money, and we will control things."
That could be wishful thinking, given Russia's track record in attracting foreign investment to its flagging gold sector.
"The lack of investment in the area is quite incredible at the moment," said bullion analyst Andrea Hotter of Metal Bulletin Research in London.
One reason is that Russia has made it tough to export gold.
"The issue of exporting gold has not yet been resolved by the government, but they are working to liberalise the market," Mikhailov said, adding that the government buys gold from domestic mines at international prices but pays in roubles.
Sukhoi Log could be worth $12.4 billion at current world gold prices -- but small Star Mining will have to cough up plenty to turn it into a silk purse.
Lenzoloto wants the tender winner to pay a $60 million signing bonus, $200 million for the equity stake and provide $500 million in bank-guaranteed financing. Mikhailov estimated the project's total cost at $1.5 billion.
Star Mining signed a memorandum last year with South African mining group JCI Ltd for JCI to acquire an option for shares in Star unit Star Technology Systems Ltd that would give JCI an economic interest of up to 30 percent in Sukhoi Log.
"Sukhoi Log was the jewel," Smith said. "But tenders have been known to be postponed. It seems to be a very slow project in getting started up."

Russian oil refiners are eyeing costly upgrades to make the lighter products that export markets favour, but they may find it hard to find the cash.
Hydrocrackers and fluid catalytic crackers -- expensive, sophisticated plants that produce lighter material like gasoline, naphtha, diesel and jet fuel -- are rare in Russia, where heavy fuel oil makes up around 40 percent of output.
Most Russian refiners use less sophisticated processing technologies, and only three percent of capacity comes from cracking processes, well below Western levels.
"There's just a screaming need for secondary capacity," said a senior Western energy consultant in Moscow. "But who's willing to invest in a Russian refinery?"
Boston Consulting Group says that by 2000, new capacities in Russia could include 254,000 barrels per day (bpd) of catalytic cracking and 131,000 bpd of hydrocracking, both used to produce expensive, high-octane fuels.
The increases, and boosts to other processes, could bring Russia's products output to 5.9 million bpd by 2000 from a current 5.2 million -- but the analysts said they would not mean heavy product output falls by the wayside.
"You will clearly increase light products capacity, but you also at least maintain the heavy products," said Boston Consulting Group Vice-President Charbel Ackermann. "It's not a substitution or reduction for heavy capacity."
Oil sources said Russia's 28 major refineries had collectively put in 28 formal requests to international lenders and banks for loans for upgrades -- but money has not flowed in.
"Lots are talking about it, but few are actually doing it," said Bechtel International Inc. Vice-President Robert Parker.
In one of many plans dependent on full financing, Russia's Kirishi refinery has said it hopes Chevron will help install a $750 million hydrocracker.
The Yaroslavl refinery, north of Moscow, is getting a $60 million catalytic cracking unit to boost gasoline output, while the Angarsk refinery in Siberia is working with M. W. Kellogg on a $70 million plan for a fluid catalytic cracking unit.
The Fuel and Energy Ministry said the Omsk refinery, in Siberia, would get a catalytic reforming plant by 2000, and that ABB Lummus Global was working on plans to help the Perm, Samara, Angarsk and other refineries install catalytic crackers.
Rif Usmanov, chief engineer at the Ufa refinery in southern Russia, said the plant's catalytic cracking facility, completed in March, would produce two million tonnes of gasoline and diesel a year (about 40,000 bpd).
An engineer at the Ryazan refinery south of Moscow said revamping of a catalytic cracking unit to raise capacity to 24,000 bpd would continue into 1997.
"A lot of projects are merely adjusting the heights of the columns and tinkering with other things," said energy specialist Peter Houlder at CentreInvest consultancy in Moscow. "But most of these are not $200-$300 million projects."
Some question the timing of the proposed upgrades, saying transport costs to Europe will squeeze margins too much.
"A lot of ambition is geared on the basis of exporting product to Europe, which I don't think is that logical," Parker said. "Continental Europe is surrounded by state-of-the-art, high-tech refineries and sophisticated distribution."
But the economy in Russia's Volga and Urals regions, where heavy industry is in steep decline, is not picking up quickly and may not be able to absorb new products output soon.
"With the domestic market's limited absorption capacity, you'll still see an inclination to export heavy," Ackermann said.

Russia's energy sector will soon have fewer domestic players as newly-privatised oil companies eye domestic mergers and acquisitions to improve production and refining margins, industry sources said on Monday.
Producers -- eager to cash in on higher refined oil products prices abroad and at home and to replenish books with cash for big-ticket production projects -- were beginning to eye downstream and upstream consolidation, analysts said.
While it was early for formal mergers, they said Russian companies were beginning to lay the groundwork for acquisitions and a shakeout of the sector's dozen or so vertically-integrated companies and eight independent firms was inevitable after 1998.
"Undoubtedly we will see a winnowing," said Stephen O'Sullivan, director of oil and gas at MC Securities in London.
"There are too many oil companies and not all can survive."
Moscow has transformed its old Soviet production associations into vertically-integrated companies, but the process left most firms with major imbalances between production and refining.
Russia is awash in refining overcapacity, which, at 6.8 million barrels per day, far outstrips current output of around 5.8 million bpd -- making refineries prime takeover candidates.
"Yes, I see consolidation," said Dan Lubash, managing director of Emerging Markets Europe at Merrill Lynch in London. "Margins in a market in transition tend to move very quickly."
In one example of the slimming awaiting the world's third largest oil producer, Russia's LUKoil -- one of the world's largest oil companies by reserves -- said on Monday it would seek to acquire Norsi-Oil, an independent refiner with marketing units and no production facilities.
"This is not a hostile takeover, but rather two companies working together," said LUKoil spokesman Pyotr Neyev, adding LUKoil would seek a major equity stake in the plant.
Analysts said producers were increasingly annoyed at seeing lower profits from refineries where they conducted tolling operations -- supplying crude oil for processing at plants they do not own and then taking it back for resale.
In a second takeover battle, an industry source said oil major SIDANCO and mini-major Sibneft were tussling for Rosneft, the state oil holding firm which holds the government's stake in production-sharing deals and is slated for privatisation.
Analysts said a third shakeout could see Sibneft making a play for the East Siberian Oil and Gas exploration company.
"Downstream in Russia, something has to happen," said a senior Western consultant. "The money's not coming back to the producers, and something has to be consolidated."
But upstream consolidation is also inevitable, since the future of Russian oil is in hard-to-recover, remote, expensive reserves requiring a pooling of cash and technical expertise.
"If you're aiming at economies of scale in five years, you've got to start the (consolidation) process now, and that's what we're seeing" said the Western consultant.
One such deal tried and failed last year, when former Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik tried to create a giant oil corporation by merging four companies -- the Tyumen Oil Company, ONAKO, the Eastern Oil Company and Slavneft.
"The general feeling is that only those strong enough in terms of corporate structures and centralised cash flows will be looking to pick up assets in the upstream business," said a Russian energy analyst at a Western investment bank in Moscow.
But analysts said mergers were already on many companies' agendas.
"There are two driving forces here," said O'Sullivan. "A desire to move into downstream, and a drive by existing companies to consolidate their existing holdings fast."

Russia's top aluminium smelters said on Monday attempts to fix contracts with Ukraine's main raw materials supplier had met with no success and Ukraine was instead courting a rival smelter in Tajikistan.
Russia, chronically short of supplies of alumina, has been seeking supply contracts from Ukraine's Mykolayivsky Hlynozemny plant, with an eye to securing nearby raw materials at attractive prices.
But Russian metals officials said Mykolayivskiy had been reluctant so far, leaving Russia's giant Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk smelters with no alumina supplies this year from Ukraine.
"We have reached no agreement with Mikolayivskiy over supplies," said Yuri Shlaifshtein, a board member at Bratsk, the world's largest smelter.
"They're asking prices above world levels -- they can't go on like this much longer."
Mikolayivskiy's deputy commercial director, Hennady Bushtruk, earlier told Reuters in the southern Ukrainian town where the plant is based that it planned to sell 90 percent of its 1997 output to Russia but no contracts had yet been signed.
He declined to name prices.
But Shlaifshtein said the plant was asking around $270 per tonne, above world levels, and wanted to sell the bulk of its supplies to Tajikistan's Tursunzade smelter.
Mykolayivskiy is one of the largest plants of its kind in the region, with a production capacity of one million tonnes a year.
It takes about two tonnes of alumina to produce one tonne of primary aluminium, making Mykolayivskiy capable of supplying enough alumina to account for nearly 20 percent of Russia's 1996 output of 2.87 million tonnes.
Russia has only two functioning alumina plants which can meet only 30 percent of smelters' demand.
The lack of raw materials and tight finances have given tolling a key role in the Russian aluminium industry.
Under tolling, smelters import raw materials, usually through international commodities houses, process them and then export them, paying back the houses with some of the proceeds.
Shlaifshtein said even Mikolayivskiy wanted to toll alumina at places like Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk rather than sell outright to Russian plants.
Mikolayivskiy, which supplied 800,000 tonnes to Russia in 1994, according to Russian news agencies, was now selling most of its supplies to Tursunzade, officials said.
Krasnoyarsk board chairman Gennady Druzhinin and Shlaifshtein said recent talks with Mikolayivskiy had come to naught, but Bratsk and Kranosyarsk had already covered most of their alumina supplies for production this year.
"Their prices are too high," said Druzhinin.
Russian plants usually complete talks for alumina supply contracts in December of the preceeding year.
"We've basically covered our supplies for the year," Druzhinin said. "Bratsk has Pavlodar (the big Kazakh alumina plant), so it's easier for them."
He said Krasnoyarsk was working with London-based Trans-World Group to invest in the financially troubled Achinsk plant to boost alumina output to 700,000 tonnes this year and to have a more secure source of supplies.

Russia's Norilsk Nickel, one of the world's largest nickel producers, kept metals traders on guard on Thursday after a short strike by unpaid workers raised long-term questions over future output and exports.
Interfax news agency said workers at some Norilsk Nickel metals group plants struck for two hours on Thursday over wage arrears, temporarily halting output.
The strike, the second at the company this year, unnerved industry players, who said Norilsk could either increase exports to generate cash to pay overdue salaries or cut back output and exports because of labour unrest.
"It's a minefield," said a nickel trader at a major Western commodities house.
"If you deal with these people very carefully, things will be okay -- but only if," the source said, adding that instability in Russia's coal industry could spread to Russia's non-ferrous metals sector.
Interfax said Norilsk workers would refuse to load metals for export from September 16 unless an agreement was reached with management over 800 billion roubles ($148.7 million) in wage arrears.
"The problem is serious and possibly long-term," said Ilya Korotkov, product manager at Russian metals exporter European Materials Agency, which exports small amounts of Norilsk output.
"They will try to export more to pay off salaries," he said, adding that exports could rise 10-15 percent in the second quarter of 1996. "They don't have many other choices."
Russia is the world's largest miner of nickel ore and concentrate, and Norilsk, whose exports are key to balance in the market, is the world's second largest producer of refined nickel, a key ingredient in stainless steel.
The company also produces huge quantities of copper, cobalt, platinum and platinum group metals.
"They really have some severe problems with cash flows," said Olga Vinogradova, a metals analyst at United City Bank in Moscow, adding she had heard of some export delays, which traders had reported earlier this week. "This strike is not going to have a positive impact on clients."
Sources said Norilsk was moving from pre-financing to Western export credits to boost profitability.
Benchmark nickel contracts on the London Metals Exchange are at around $7,530 a tonne, down from September highs of $7,850.
Sources said Norilsk, which reported a net profit for 1995 of 138 billion roubles and debts of 6.8 trillion roubles, all under Russian accounting standards, was facing one of its first major financial tests since privatisation.
Norilsk director Alexander Khloponin has said he wants to turn the company around and Interfax quoted him as saying he saw several ways to raise cash to pay salaries, including asset sales, more effective exports and more efficient production.
Norilsk produced 180,100 tonnes of nickel in 1995, up nearly 11 percent from 1994, and it expects 1996 production to rise by three percent.
But Russian nickel output, most of it at Norilsk, fell seven percent in August on July levels, according to state figures.
Trade sources said Norilsk, built in 1935 on a swamp 200 km (130 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, was strugging with its status as a cash-sucking firm that must fly in food and soap for workers.
"Workers don't have much there, and the least they expect is their salary," said a Russian metals source. "But turning that place around is easier said than done."

Russia's delays in exporting platinum metals to an increasingly tight and edgy world market stem from a volatile cocktail of internal power struggles and bureaucratic foul-ups, industry sources said on Friday.
Few Western traders and analysts believed Moscow was intentionally withholding supplies in order to boost the market, which earlier this month saw palladium prices at 17-year highs and platinum at a seven-year peak.
Most Russian sources have said the delays in deliveries from the world's biggest supplier of palladium and second largest of platinum are due to problems with red tape in Moscow, and that no larger issues are at play.
But Western industry analysts say in-fighting among state bodies for control over Russia's multi-billion-dollar white metal exports is probably a major factor.
"I believe it started out as a power struggle and has been considerably exacerbated by red tape," said Rhona O'Connell, precious metals analyst at T Hoare &amp; Co in London.
Two other Western analysts said it was unlikely Russia had left the market just to boost prices, as it did in the 1970s.
"They understand what can happen when you meddle in the market," said one London analyst, referring to a time when Russian supply delays backfired because Western electrical companies simply turned to silver instead.
Russia's senior metals officials have taken refuge behind a wall of silence on the delays, now running at five months.
Russia accounts for nearly two thirds of the world's palladium supply and around 20 percent of platinum deliveries. At one point this year prices for palladium, used in catalytic converters, electronics and dentistry, doubled to $240.00 an ounce.
Sister metal platinum rose 20 percent in the first week of June to around $500.00 an ounce but have since slipped back to around $416.
"There was a period, after the reorganisation of (state strategic reserve) Gokhran and the functions of the Economy Ministry in this area, when it took time to sort out quota and licensing procedures," said a source at Almazjuvelirexport, the state agency exporting the metals.
Almaz completed talks in mid-June with buyers in Japan, the world's largest consumer of platinum and palladium. But after quoting Japanese buyers various possible dates for the resumption of exports and leaving markets guessing on when it would start deliveries, Almaz has clammed up.
"Mr Berlin does not wish to give any comments on the situation," said an employee, referring to Vitaly Berlin, the head of Almaz's platinum unit.
One Almaz source again cited red tape, saying, "It would be fair to say technical, bureaucratic procedures are to blame."
The Russian institutions involved in precious metals have undergone major changes in the past 12 or so months. Gokhran, now GosFond, is no longer under the aegis of Roskomdragmet and is administered by the Economy and Finance Ministries.
Roskomdragmet, the former state committee for precious metals and precious stones, was disbanded in mid-1996. A sweeping government reshuffle in March in effect disbanded the Industry Ministry, which had jurisdiction over precious metals output.
But one official disagreed with the red tape theory.
"This is disinformation -- Almaz has no bureaucratic problems," said Yuri Boikin, deputy head of the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry's foreign economic activities department.
"Almaz has a government order to sell -- when it does that is its problem. They can do it whenever they want. On the second day after getting the quota they can get a general licence. Why they haven't prepared documents and contracts is their problem."
Western markets also question how much Russia's stockpiles have dwindled in the past three or four years on strong exports.
"The general sense is that they've got plenty of palladium but that platinum could be running short," one source said, quoting a second trader who thought Russia had only six months of platinum left.
One London trader said Almaz was ready to export in March but that President Boris Yeltsin disbanded the Industry Ministry that month and that the central bank may have heated up the campaign for control over the marketing of Russia's white metals.

Russian oil producers have seen limited benefit from a rise in world crude prices over the past 12 months, as their costly transformation into capitalist companies sucks up extra cash, energy analysts said on Friday.
"To a certain extent, you can say they have benefited," said Peter Houlder, head of the CentreInvest group consultancy and an energy specialist. "But the tax system has been pretty efficient in catching up with a lot of this increased revenue."
Oil prices currently stand about $5 a barrel above levels seen this time last year, defying analysts' predictions of weaker oil on what was expected to have been an easing of the United Nations' Gulf War ban on Iraqi oil sales this year.
Analysts said that Russia, the world's third largest oil producer, would in theory have earned an extra $2 billion or so from its exports of about 96 million tonnes of crude to cash-paying, mostly Western countries over the past 12 months.
But the unexpectedly bullish market has not directly translated into fistfulls of cash as it did for the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s, when output peaked at 570 million tonnes after world oil prices rose to nearly $50 a barrel.
"Russian exports are not just a question of profits, but of liquidity," said Catherine MacDougall, Russia analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London, referring to producers' need for cash to keep operations going. "If you take excise and other taxes, there has been limited benefit to Russian producers."
Russian oil companies are seeing higher world oil prices for the first time since being spun off from the state into privatised, vertically-integrated companies -- and are using export cash as working capital to keep output flowing.
Crude exports now carry big pipeline and transit fees. Companies pay an output duty as well as an export duty, currently about 51,000 to 83,000 roubles ($9.50 to $15.46) a tonne.
Corporate taxes are revenue, not profit, based, with the average company in a 70 percent bracket but paying only 30 percent to keep cash on hand.
Gennady Vasilyev, an independent energy consultant for the World Bank, said Russian producers had earned more from exports this year -- but that they also had bigger debts.
"Of course they have earned more, but they are also restructuring and consolidating and trying to clear out their debts," he said.
In the 1970s, when Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members sent the price of oil soaring, the Soviet Union cashed in with windfall petrodollar profits that built up its mighty military machine.
The exports gave the Soviet economy tens of billions of extra dollars, and production associations, the precursors of Russia's privatised oil majors. They paid small taxes and adhered to communist accounting practices which did not account for costs.
MC Securities, in a report on LUKoil, Russia's top oil producer, said the company boosted upstream revenues and net profits 30 percent in the first half of this year, with exports benefiting from higher world prices.
Pyotr Neyev, LUKoil spokesman, said the company's average exports of one million tonnes a month had helped, but not as much as might be expected, partly due to the failure of some customers to pay their bills.
Total Russian crude exports to solvent customers rose nearly 7.5 percent last year, while shipments to former Soviet countries slipped nearly 20 percent, according to fuel and energy ministry figures.
"With our debt situation, the word 'profit' must always be put in quotation marks," LUKoil's Neyev said. ($1=5367 Rouble)

The Prague Cultural Heritage Office is taking the Terminator head-on by rejecting plans for altering an historic city-centre building into a Planet Hollywood theme restaurant, a Czech daily said on Tuesday.
The heritage watchdog said designs for the film-kitsch cafe, one in a chain co-founded by Arnold Schwarzenegger, star of the Terminator films, would destroy some of the classic house's features in a UN protected heritage zone.
"It is a historically valuable object, and in a UNESCO reservation, therefore we can not allow its devastation," the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Ladislav Spacek from the office as saying.
Numerous licences are required for building in Prague's historical centre, as bureaus specialising in everything from architecture to anthropology are consulted before the final licence for opening the site is granted.
But local partners in the project said it will go forward.
Schwarzenegger, who founded the chain along with fellow screen stars Demi Moore, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone and British entrepreneur Robert Earl, came to Prague in August to inaugurate construction by donating a laser gun from his latest sci-fi thriller "Eraser".
The heritage office said the planned destruction of the building's inner walls, in order to get more room for film projections, and permanently sealing windows facing a boulevard in Prague's banking district, would kill the house's character.
"They want to turn this attractive object into a dead house, that is unthinkable for us," Spacek told the paper.
The paper quoted local partner Prague Investments  as saying that Planet Hollywood would stick to its concept.
"I think that everything will be solved to the satisfaction of both sides," Jitka Cihakova said.
Officials from the heritage office and Prague Investments were not available for additional comment.
The site previously housed a stamp collector's shop and optician.
The construction has already gotten off to a rough start. Last week scaffolding collapsed, injuring one worker and demolishing a garden restaurant that Planet Hollywood installed in front of the future diner.

Opposition leader Milos Zeman asked Czech parliament on Wednesday to approve a separate resolution which would "clarify" his concerns about a post-World War Two reconciliation pact with Germany.
But deputies in Zeman's own Social Democratic party (CSSD) admitted that the votes were probably were still there, without the extra resolution, to push the deal with Germany through parliament, and save the Czech government from embarrassment.
As debate dragged into a second day on the declaration -- already signed by the Prague and Bonn governments and approved by the German parliament -- Zeman demanded the accompanying rider, which the governing coalition has already rejected.
"I would want to believe this parliament would find the courage to express itself on the declaration in its resolution, as the parliament of a sovereign state," said Zeman, who chairs the lower house and the CSSD.
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's three-party conservative coalition, which is two seats short of a majority in the lower house, has rejected any sort of extra resolution which may "interpret" the already-signed declaration.
In the accord, Bonn expresses regret for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague its sorrow for brutality in post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans.
The text also includes German support for Czech membership of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).
It also skirts around the most sensitive issues of direct compensation for property seized from the expelled Germans.
German politicians sympathetic to families of expellees, now mostly residing in southern Germany, have said that the issue of individual compensation for property was still open, despite the inter-governmental declaration.
Zeman said the comments made by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, after he signed the document, and later by Finance Minister Theo Waigel, showed that Bonn considered the "property problems" still unresolved.
"These subsequent statements are the basic reason for my concern," Zeman told Czech parliament.
CSSD vice-chairman Karel Machovec said that while the add-on resolution, which has yet to be presented, might help ensure a larger majority for the declaration, he acknowledged the government probably had the votes to win.
"I know about three or four Social Democrats who would vote for the declaration," Machovec told Reuters, saying he would be among members voting in favour of the deal with Germany.
But debate in the Czech lower house looked set to continue late into the week, with small opposition parties attempting filibusters and other procedural moves to block the declaration from coming to a vote.
The ultra-right Republican Party and the Communist Party claim that the declaration lets Germany off lightly for Nazi attrocities and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.

Czech engineering group Skoda a.s., a local agent for U.S.-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. (MD) is proposing a barter deal be used to encourage the Czech government to buy MD's F/A-18 "Hornet" fighter aircraft.
Skoda's spokesman Karel Samec said on Wednesday his firm would provide trucks made at Skoda's troubled Tatra a.s. and other goods in return for planes which the cash-strapped Czech military is considering in an upgrade its fleet.
"McDonnell Douglas chose us as intermediator, but it depends on the Czech government and the Defence Ministry which has to decide if they want to buy any planes at all," he said.
"It's a barter deal. They would supply the fighters, and we would supply Czech goods to the States, namely Tatras and other things... And I know from the American side that this project has the support of the U.S. government," Samec added.
The Czechs along with former Warsaw Pact allies Poland and Hungary, all seen as frontrunners to join NATO, want to upgrade their fleets to be compatible with the military alliance.
McDonnell Douglas is competing against U.S. Lockheed Martin , makers of the F-16, Sweden's SAAB, which makes the "Gripen", France's "Mirage", and other groups to update a fleet of ageing Soviet-made Mig-21 planes.
However, the Czech government has delayed a decision on buying the planes as proposed cuts in defence spending have clouded the debate over the upgrading the army's aging fighters.
A spokesman at the Defence Ministry was not immediately avbailable for comment.
The Czech military has said it would need about 24 fighters to replace its old MiG-21s, while Hungary said it needs around 30 and Poland 100.
Samec said the deal would be for new or used F/A-18 "Hornets", and would help the heavily-indebted Tatra, whose production has fallen to a fraction of communist-era levels.
"It would be a penetration (for Tatra) into the world's most important market... and it is advantageous because the Tatras have Detroit Diesel motors, so it could be used perhaps in the U.S. army," said Samec.
None of the fighter producers has publicly stated a price at which they would sell their planes to the Czech government.
Analysts say the planes typically cost over $20 million a piece new without supplementary equipment and technology. A cheaper option would be to buy second-hand planes at a fraction of the cost.

Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky said media reaction to the failure of Kreditni Banka a.s. last month temporarily destabilised the banking sector, but it is basically sound.
After closed-door testimony to a parliamentary banking commission, Tosovsky told reporters the system -- especially the four largest banks where most activity is centred -- is on a firm footing after a period of consolidation.
"It sounds parodoxical at the present time when its credibility is declining, but the banking sector is in very good health," Tosovsky said.
"The four biggest banks have a market value of about 110 billion crowns, while in 1990 they had a negative value... these banks represent more than 70 percent of the sector."
The governor said the public uproar after the collapse of the medium-sized Plzen-based Kreditni Banka last month led to a decline in confidence in Czech banks, but he blamed the media and politicians for this.
He said the collapse caused a liquidity crunch in the system, but he declined to say which banks, if any, were threatened by the reaction.
"We rather consider it as a liquidity problem than anything else, but I obviously cannot give information about any concrete banks," he said.
Kreditni was the 11th bank to need help from the central bank, which tightened its oversight of operations in a move to consolidate the country's banking sector.
But the case of Kreditni, whose estimated losses totalled nearly 12 billion crowns, was followed by reports in local media that larger banks might be in trouble.
One report in the weekly Respekt claimed Agrobanka a.s., the largest fully private bank, had been ignored by the interbank lending market and was suffering liquidity problems.
The bank has yet to comment publicly on the report.
Then the chairman of parliament Milos Zeman, who leads the opposition Social Democrats, claimed in a television discussion programme that the largest savings bank Ceska Sporitelna a.s. had unspecified problems.
The bank strongly denied this, and said Zeman's remarks led to unusually high withdrawals in the following days.
Tosovsky said the CNB was prepared "to function as the last resort creditor, in certain moments -- above all if there is a liquidity problem."
Tosovsky, who sits on a select government committee investigating Kreditni's failure, said he would support a separate parliamentary commission probing the subject as well.
He said that after a three-year moratorium on granting new banking licences ended earlier this year with the CNB's awarding of two licences to a German and a British bank, the central bank might consider other candidates.
"We do not intend to seal off the market hermetically, so we are looking for a policy of something in between... and give a chance to quality institutions," Tosovsky said.

The leading Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats (CSSD), confirmed chairman Milos Zeman and his confrontational style at a weekend national conference, while eliminating his main rivals.
But Zeman only partly succeeded in uniting the party leadership as he disposed most of his internal oppositon, including the more compromising deputy chairman Karel Machovec.
Still, the conference rejected one of Zeman's favourites for a senior party post, and confirmed as deputy chairwoman Petra Buzkova, the most popular Czech politician according to opinion polls, over Zeman's objections.
Despite achieving relative success in last June's elections -- where the CSSD finished a surpisingly strong second, stripping the conservative government's majority in parliament -- delegates elected Zeman with only 72 percent of the vote.
That was about 14 percentage points lower than at the 1996 national CSSD congress.
The leftist daily Pravo said Zeman's position will not likely be as solid in the party despite throwing off Machovec. Commentator Alexandr Mitrofanov said that it was likely that the new leadership "would not give Zeman peaceful work in the circle of the faithful".
Many Czech commentators criticised the CSSD on Monday for taking a more radical route.
The right-leaning daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said, "Zeman's dream of showing the Social Democrats to the public as a serious alternative to the government dissolved... in the wind of partisan passions."
It said the CSSD has defined itself as by showing diletantism and devoting time to elimination of internal enemies rather than to finding alternative solutions.
"Zeman bets on political superstition and carelessness of people othrwise adult and reasonable," wrote Jefim Fistejn in the frequently pro-governemnt daily Lidove Noviny.
Zeman has aimed at voters of unreformed communists and ultra-right republicans as a source of more votes, while Machovec was campaigning for a shift to the centre and less emotional clashes with the government.
An opinion poll released by the state-funded research agency IVVM on Monday showed the CSSD's gap with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party grew in early March to 26 to 19 percent, from February support of 24 to 21 percent.
Over the four years of his chairmanship, Zeman has adopted a strictly anti-government rhetoric, and managed to lead the party from the opposition wilderness to a major force.
But the CSSD had a huge rift late last year when several deputies, including Machovec and budget committee chairman Josef Wagner, broke ranks in voting with the government on its 1997 balanced budget.
Delegates at the conference responded to Zeman's calls and voted to expell Wagner from the party, and denied the deputy chairman's post to Machovec.
In his keynote speech at the conference, Zeman called for a fast action on what he said was an impending economic crisis, and on white-collar economic crime, and fast action to reverse the growing trade deficit, including pro-export measures.
The party confirmed its support for Czech NATO and European Union membership, but repeated calls for a referendum on both.

The Czech parliament began debate on Tuesday on a post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany which the Prague government sees as key to EU and NATO membership. Opposition deputies call it a betrayal.
The pact faces a potentially long and unpleasant fight in the Czech lower house, especially from the ultra-right Republican Party and the Communists, who say it lets Germany off lightly for Nazi attrocities and the dismemberment of what was then Czechoslovakia.
Deputies voted narrowly to move the sensitive declaration, which was signed last month by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to the top of the agenda for the session.
"The declaration was adopted in the (German parliament) two weeks ago with a large majority. I believe the Czech parliament will approach it in the same way," Klaus told the chamber.
In the accord, Bonn expresses regret for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague its sorrow for brutality in post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans.
The text also includes German support for Czech membership of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).
Klaus said the accord was an important international message that the Czech Republic does not have open political issues with its neighbours.
The declaration does not need to be ratified by parliament but a rejection by deputies would embarrass Klaus's minority coalition government, which wants as strong a show of support.
The Republicans have promised a filibuster in an attempt to block the declaration from coming to a vote, but political analysts believe the measure will pass, if just narrowly.
A vote, technically, could come later on Tuesday, but many expect the debate to take days.
The main opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) have not said if they will support the declaration and have sought a separate parliamentary resolution, partly on the grounds that the text does not acknowledge the legal validity of the Czechs' actions.
But Klaus told deputies that the accord respected legal norms in both states and did not question the results of the 1945 Potsdam conference, at which the Czechoslovak government was given the right to expel the ethnic Germans.
He also said the text did not affect Czechs' rights to property seized from the ethnic Germans.
The CSSD leadership has agreed to allow its members a free vote, probably ensuring that the government will get the votes it needs from the opposition to approve the accord.

A Czech cabinet decision to require deposits on consumer goods imports will be less harmful for inflation than the rejected option of import surcharges but may have little impact on the trade deficit, analysts said on Friday.
But they praised a government plan, revealed on Wednesday as part of an economic revival package, to cut public sector wage growth to 7.3 percent this year from the planned 11.9 percent, saying this would be more effective in pushing down demand for imported products than the deposit programme.
The analysts polled by Reuters said the deposit programme, which will come into effect on Monday, would not have a great impact on consumer prices.
Under the deposit scheme, importers will be required to deposit 20 percent of the value of imported consumer goods on an interest-free account for 180 days.
The commercial banks will channel the money from their branches to state-held development bank Konsolidacni Banka.
Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, officially announcing the new measure on Friday, said he hoped the restriction would reverse the trend of the widening trade deficit, but did not make a more specific forecast.
"Deposits are a better way than an import surcharge, which would raise inflation, and import quotas, which would be unwelcome internationally," said ING Barings analyst Boris Gomez.
He saw little impact on the trade deficit from the deposit scheme but added that imports could fall as a result of a decline in domestic demand caused by lower wage growth.
"I believe that the government will be able to go ahead with the wage restrictions. The question is whether the private sector will follow," Gomez said.
Minister Dlouhy said the deposits would apply to some 30 percent of imports, including selected foodstuffs, cars, electronics, textile products, furniture, and appliances.
Vladimir Kreidl of investment bank Patria Finance said the wage growth limits were "very drastic and ambitious" and said staff were likely to be laid off in order to meet the target.
"If well implemented, the measures should benefit the economy...The trade deficit should be reduced by 30-50 billion crowns from the originally expected 200-220 billion (1997 deficit)," Kreidl said.
The trade gap rose to 160.3 billion crowns last year from under 100 billion in 1995, and official estimates before imposition of the import deposits were projecting this year's deficit to range around 210 bilion.
But Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka said the import deposits would have virtually no impact on the trade balance.
"I am leaving my prediction (of the foreign trade deficit) unchanged at 180 billion," he said, addding that a major change could come only through a change of the exchange rate policy.
Analysts said the programme would have minimal impact on inflation, which fell to 6.8 percent year on year in March.
"The effect in the cost of imported goods would be a year-on-year increase in inflation of about 0.3-0.4 percent," said Jack Schrantz, head of research at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment in Prague.
"But this will be offset by other factors such as decreased government spending and a slowdown in the economy," he added.
Other measures taken by the cabinet include 25.5 billion in budget cuts, setting up an independent capital market oversight body, promoting exports, and fighting more intensively against economic crime.
The package also calls for speeding up privatisation of state-held companies, relaxation of monetary policy, and separation of banks' investment and commercial arms.

The Czech Republic appeared headed for its first budget deficit despite earlier reports by the fiscally-hawkish government that it had achieved a surplus for the fourth successive year.
"(We expect) the definitive results for 1996 will range around a deficit of 1.7 billion crowns," Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said on Wednesday in testimony to parliament's budget committtee.
The Czechs have had three surplus budgets since Czechoslovakia split in 1993.
Final data were due in the ministry on Wednesday but as local media paid close attention to whether monetarist Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus would maintain his fiscal winning streak, Havel said the trend was not positive.
He said that by Wednesday revenues totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.5 billion.
More bills may be delivered after the deadline, inflating expenditures further, Havel said.
The government made last-ditch efforts in December when the budget looked headed for a more than five billion crown deficit, by freezing some outlays until 1997, and requiring early repayment on credit granted to a deposit insurance fund.
The budget has been hampered by lower-than-expected tax revenue and delayed repayment on credits to Russia.
The 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of spending cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns.
Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome, but he was concerned with the effects government payment adjustments may have on the 1997 budget.
Part of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which was due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s.
Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the "alpha and omega" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus, made by the finance ministry soon after the new year, as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility.
Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.
But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996.
Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay.

IBM Corp's Czech unit said on Monday it would appeal against a Defence Ministry decision to award a 1.3 billion crown ($45 million) deal to deliver an information system to a consortium of EDS and Digital Equipment Corp.
IBM said in a statement that EDS-Digital did not fulfil a tender condition that stipulated participation of only those companies which had accomplished projects in the Czech Republic to a similar extent.
"There are a number of reasons why we are appealing, we are still working on it," said IBM's spokesman Michal Urvalek. He declined to give more information on the appeal.
The IBM move comes on the heels of Unisys Corp's announcement on Thursday that it too would appeal the decision. Any appeals must be delivered to the ministry this week.
IBM placed third in the eyes of an 11-member committee evaluating bidders in the tender, behind Unisys which came in first and EDS-Digital, which won the contract after the ministry decided not to follow ratings.
Implementation of the staff information system is seen as a large step on the path to make the Czech army more compatible with armed forces of NATO countries, but finding its supplier has been a struggle.
Unisys won an original four billion crown supply tender which was annulled last year after Czech competition authorities found irregularities in the process.
The original tender was cancelled by the Defence Ministry, but the former Ministry for Economic Competition intervened and cancelled that decision before ordering a new tender itself.
Unisys and IDOM, a unit of Deloitte and Touche, were ousted from the new tender earlier this year for application violations, but were later allowed to re-enter the competition.
Unisys denied the mistakes, as revealed by the ministry, ever happened.
In announcing the winner, Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny said the technical quality of EDS-Digital and Unisys bids was almost identical, but EDS was chosen because its offer was 109 million crowns cheaper.
After Vyborny's announcement, Unisys immediately said it would appeal to the Economic Competition Office if necessary. On Monday Unisys officials added they could not rule out a request for police to investigate the tender proceedings.
"Our lawyers are investigating this possibility...but it is priority number two, a step after other possibilities fail," said Jiri Nykodym of Unisys's Czech unit.
Unisys said Vyborny was wrong to take the decision since under tender rules, price should have been a decisive factor only if two bidders received identical scores from the commission.
"The tender rules were broken and in fact, the way of evaluation of bids was changed in the course of the tender at the moment when it became clear that...Unisys would have won the tender for the second time," Nykodym said.

The Czech parliament began debate on Tuesday on a post-World War Two reconciliation agreement with Germany which the Prague government sees as key to EU and NATO membership, while opposition deputies call it a betrayal.
It faces a potentially long and unpleasant fight in the Czech lower house, especially from the ultra-right Republican Party and the Communists, who claim it lets Germany off lightly for Nazi attrocities and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.
Deputies voted narrowly to move the sensitive declaration, which was already signed last month by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to the top of the agenda for the session.
"The declaration was adopted in the (German parliament) two weeks ago with a large majority. I believe the Czech parliament will approach it in the same way," Klaus told the chamber.
In the accord, Bonn expresses regret for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague its sorrow for brutality in post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans.
The text also includes German support for Czech membership of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).
Klaus said the accord was an important international message that the Czech Republic does not have open political issues with its neighbours.
The declaration does not need to be ratified by parliament but a rejection by deputies would embarrass Klaus's minority coalition government, which wants as strong a show of support.
The Republicans have promised a filibuster in an attempt to block the declaration from coming to a vote, but analysts believe the measure will pass, if just narrowly.
A vote, technically, could come later on Tuesday, but many expect the debate to take days.
The main opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) have not said if they will support the declaration and have sought a separate parliamentary resolution, partly on the grounds that the text does not acknowledge the legal validity of the Czechs' actions.
But Klaus told deputies that the accord respected legal norms in both states and did not question the results of the 1945 Potsdam conference, at which the Czechoslovak government was given the right to expel the ethnic Germans.
He also said the text did not affect Czechs' rights to property seized from the ethnic Germans.
The CSSD leadership has agreed to allow its members a free vote, probably ensuring that the government will get the votes it needs from the opposition to approve the accord.
"I know about three or four Social Democrats who would vote for the declaration," CSSD vice-chairman Karel Machovec told Reuters, saying he was among those who would vote in favour.
The accord remains controversial in Germany, where relatives and supportes of the Sudeten Germans have demanded restitution of proerty confiscated by the Czechs.
"The Czech Republic in accordance with its legal order and many norms of international law, considers these ownership questions to be definitely closed," Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told the house.
The parliamentary group of Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) on Tuesday rejected calls for a separate resolution which might provide a Czech interpretation of the declaration.
But Machovec said a separate joint resolution would ensure a larger majority in favour of the declaration.

Chinese zinc producers are expected to take advantage of high international prices to export, though  this may lead to a domestic supply squeeze and firmer prices at home, Far East metal traders said on Monday.
With London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc prices having risen by around $50 a tonne since the start of 1997 to the highest levels in nearly two years, Chinese producers are seen accelerating sales, they said.
Three month LME zinc was little changed at $1,137/39 a tonne in early trade in London on Monday, after a kerb close of $1,139 on Friday. The market was seen consolidating after a blistering rise that peaked last week at $1,157.
Already this year, Torch Metal in Hong Kong, which sells on behalf of Chinese producers, has exported 30,000 tonnes of Chinese zinc to end-users "because the price is right," a company source said by telephone from the British colony.
None of this metal had gone to the LME warehouse in Singapore, he said, adding that Torch had a further 50,000 tonnes of zinc to sell in the course of 1997 and would not hesitate to take advantage of price rallies.
A Chinese trader in Beijing said one of the major smelters had sold between 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes of Chinese metal in late December at 9,800 yuan ($1,180) a tonne FOB (free on board) southern Chinese ports.
That metal was exported after the government wiped out the five percent zinc export tax on January 1, 1997, he said.
"That zinc was sold before the rally, but it was still quite expensive," he said.
A futures trader with a state Chinese firm in Singapore said Chinese producers who sold into the market before price rises could well deliver their metal to the LME to record a paper loss, but a healthy profit in the cash market.
"They (producers) would only look at the premium picture," he said. "If physical sells at a nice premium, they could sell their LME position, and sell physical based on LME prices plus a nice premium," he said.
Sources in Asia said LME price levels over $1,150 a tonne would make Chinese exports worthwhile.
"If the price goes up further, the quantity of (Chinese) exports will move up," a source in China said.
That echoed the view of a number of traders in China, Hong Kong and Singapore polled by Reuters.
Some said it could lead to another round of boom-bust trading that saw domestic Chinese zinc prices rise to 10,700 yuan ($1,289) a tonne, ex-smelter, two years ago.
The Beijing trader said China had 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes of zinc metal available for export this year.
China exports around a quarter of its annual zinc output.
Official figures show 1996 exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys rose to 226,777 tonnes, over 1995's 191,526 tonnes. December 1996 exports alone were 29,519 tonnes.
"We always believe Chinese metal will pressure the market," another Chinese source said. "Most people will see a good chance in the price rises."
But he said that once Chinese zinc producers saw they could get attractive export prices for their product, they could desert their domestic customers.
"This will squeeze domestic supplies, then domestic prices will move up, then it makes more sense to keep the metal at home because the prices are better," he said. "Here we go again."
The Beijing trader said special high grade zinc accounted for around 30,000 tonnes of Chinese exports so far this year, with the same quantity of high grade metal.
Up to 70 percent of the exports had gone to end users, he and other sources said, much of it to Japan.
Under its General System of Preferences (GSP) programme, Japan exempts metal imports from developing countries submitted for customs clearance before the April 1 start of the fiscal year. ($1=8.3 yuan)

Far East metals traders were preoccupied with one question on Monday -- will China buy copper in the midst of the current rally, or are prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) nearing precarious heights?
There was little doubt in the minds of most traders and industry sources polled by Reuters that copper prices would continue their heady rise.
Copper on the LME finished Friday trading substantially higher, with technical buying and aggressive short covering taking the red metal to fresh 8-1/2 months highs despite an unexpected stocks increase of 1,875 tonnes.
It was $2,366 a tonne at the afternoon kerb close, off the day's $2,375 high but up $38 from Thursday's finish.
Prices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SME) have been mirroring the LME's rises since trading resumed last week after the long Lunar New Year holiday.
Shanghai copper futures started higher on Monday, with the most active May 1997 contract opening at 23,500 yuan ($2,831) a tonne, rising 190 yuan from last week's close. It fell back a little to 23,460 yuan in early trading.
Trading sources in Hong Kong and Singapore said that as long as Shanghai rises along with the LME -- and as long as the LME continues to rise -- the Chinese should not be scared away from the market.
"We're starting to see the start of glimmers of interest from China to start re-importing metal they lent," a trader in Singapore said.
"But it is difficult at these high prices to see a lot of Chinese buying, though the fact remains that if they need it, there seems to be so little on the ground in China that they will have to buy it," he said.
Shanghai Metal Exchange figures show copper stocks at 17,524 tonnes, a level described by one Western trader as "nothing".
The head of a big Hong Kong trading house said there had been some signs of Chinese buying in recent weeks.
"But it's just a few hundred tonnes here, a few hundred tonnes there," he said, adding he had seen no indication that China's central reserve authorities had been in the market.
"They (Chinese end-users) do need to buy but they could be scared off by these price levels," he said. "I think the LME will go higher -- I believe it will break $2,400 (a tonne) before we see a correction."
Premiums on copper arrivals in Shanghai are now $120 a tonne over LME cash metals pushing the price close to $2,500 a tonne, an analyst here said.
Arbitrage opportunities were seen kept in check by high costs -- three percent import duty and 17 percent value-added tax (VAT).
"You're looking at healthy arbitrage opportunities looming, as long as there are discounts on the VAT," another Western source said, adding that big traders were often able to get waivers on the VAT.
Beijing's States Statistical Bureau last week released figures showing China's January copper production level at 70,000 tonnes, up 2.2 percent on January 1996.
China's total copper production in 1996 was 909,700 tonnes, up 5.71 percent on 1995, the bureau said.
Physical demand for copper in China for 1997 is expected to exceed supply by around 100,000 tonnes.
Chinese media reported last month that China's 1997 copper demand should rise five percent over last year to 1.05 million tonnes. Output is expected to be more than 900,000 tonnes.
Copper imports are expected to remain high, the newspaper said. Imports of raw and uncast copper in 1996 were up 32.7 percent in 1996 to 714,248 tonnes.

China's sugar factories could ease their financial woes by taking advantage of Far East demand and exporting to Asian users but they are unlikely to be given the go-ahead soon, trade and industry sources said on Wednesday.
Chinese producers, most of which are burdened by low prices and high debts, could earn $15-20 a tonne exporting white sugar to the region, a trader with a Western bank in Hong Kong said.
Recent Indonesian purchases of Thai sugar had tightened regional supply, which could mean Asian buyers will have to look elsewhere for their sugar, he said.
"If you take the Thai white sugar out of the market, other importers will need to find a place for sugars, so you could find interest coming from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Philippines," he said.
"And that's when China will come in as a replacement," he said.
But that wasn't likely to happen any time soon, an official of the China Sugar Association told Reuters.
"The international prices are not at a level we could be happy with," he said by telephone from Nanning, capital of Guangxi province where most of China's sugar is produced.  
Traders in Hong Kong said the current premium on white sugar over raw was $70 a tonne, but Far Eastern white sugar had a further $20 because of the cheaper regional freight rates.
The association source said the Chinese government had agreed to buy locally produced sugar for central reserves in the hope of shoring up prices still well below break-even point for the factories.
These guaranteed sales would help factories, most of which had to repay bank loans at the end of the season, he said.
Guangxi's sugar reserves currently held 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes, he said. The national figure was not available.
Central reserve sugar would not be released on to the market before ex-factory prices hit 4,400 to 4,500 yuan per tonne, another trader in Hong Kong said.
Wholesale prices had not moved above 3,800 yuan ($457) a tonne for two months, the sugar association source said, speaking anonymously. Breakeven point for factories was 4,000 yuan a tonne, he said.
Domestic demand has been flat for the past year or so, the official said, so it was difficult to predict when prices would start to firm and factories could see some profit.  
Traders said they hoped prices would firm once the harvest and crushing season finished in late March.
Sugar prices had been expected to firm in the lead-up to the Lunar New Year holiday, China's premier annual festival when confectionary demand traditionally soars.
This was not the case this year, said Asian traders just returned from their five-day break.
Slack demand for the festival compounded on-going flat consumption of soft drinks, sweets, ice-cream and other sweet luxuries that has kept China's annual sugar demand figure to around eight million tonnes in recent years, a trader with a Chinese firm in Hong Kong said.
He blamed China's sluggish economy. "If people are watching their pennies, they are not going to want to spoil themselves."
Chinese sugar demand should pick up as the summer approaches, he said, but it will be six to eight weeks before the factories see higher than break-even prices.
China's current sugar crop has been officially predicted at 6.6 million tonnes, a figure most traders polled by Reuters agreed on, though one put it closer to 6.3 million tonnes.
Imports, which central authorities have said will be 690,000 tonnes in 1997, are not expected to begin before mid-year.

Sugar producers in China are worried that a flood of imports could swamp the domestic market and drive down prices already below break-even point, industry and trade sources said on Wednesday.
White sugar prices in China's southern production belt of Guangxi province are still below 4,000 yuan ($481) per tonne, in some places dipping to 3,700 yuan ($445), traders and industry sources in China and Hong Kong told Reuters.
Break-even point was above 4,000 yuan per tonne, and prices ideally should be up to 4,200 to 4,300 yuan per tonne for the factories to make any money, a senior industry executive said.
Official Chinese media reported last week that China planned to import 690,000 tonnes of sugar in 1997.
Of that amount, 350,000 tonnes would come from Cuba, where, according to German statistician F.O. Licht, the 1996/97 sugar crop should be close to the forecast of 4.5 million tonnes.
The remainder of China's 1997 imports would come from Thailand and Australia, traders said.
Official customs figures show total 1996 sugar imports were 1.25 million tonnes, 57.5 percent down on the previous year.
One Hong Kong-based sugar trader said China's 1997 sugar imports would probably be closer to 1.5 million tonnes.
"The country has 1.2 billion people, they can consume as much as you put in there," he said.
A Hong Kong-based executive responsible for several sugar facilities in southern China, however, said that unless the Chinese government controlled the way in which the imported sugar reached the market, prices could be expected to worsen.
"It is a question of when the imports come in and how they are released on to the market," he said on condition of anonymity.
"If it is tightly controlled and it trickles on to the market, it would be OK," he said.
He said the experience of 1995 would hopefully have shown authorities the effect on the domestic industry of sudden and large injections of sugar on to the market.
That year, sugar imports hit 2.95 million tonnes, 90.3 percent more than the year before. Much of the imports were illegal, prices plummeted and many factories are still trying to recover.
The sugar cane crop in southern China is now being harvested, and white sugar prices are expected to keep softening until the crop is all in, around late March/early April.
China's officially-stated 1996/97 sugar production target has varied over the past few months, in one case going over eight million tonnes. Traders in the region have tended to put more store in an earlier figure of 6.53 million tonnes.
China's annual demand is around eight million tonnes.
Once the harvest is through, market prices should begin to improve, giving factories a chance to drag themselves out of the red and repay loans taken out to pay farmers for their cane, an industry executive said.
Factories have complained that the price they must pay farmers for cane is too high given the low market price for the processed product.
This year's cane price has been set at 230 to 300 yuan ($27-36) per tonne, about the same as last season, though that was a 65 percent increase on the 1994 set price. Ten tonnes of cane produces one tonne of white sugar.
"All the factories are strapped for cash to pay farmers for the cane, and so are selling whatever they can get just to bring some money in," the executive said.
"While there is an overhang of volume there will be pressure on prices, and introducing another 700,000 tonnes will just add another element on top of that."
Like the factory manager, he was cautiously optimistic that China's authorities had indeed learnt from 1995.
"Calculations we've done on the back of an envelope suggest that 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes will not result in oversupply," he said.
But he added that if imports did go as high as some traders predicted, "things will be quite serious".

While he ruled China, Deng Xiaoping politely declined the worshipful personality cult that grew up around his predecessor, Chairman Mao Zedong.
With his death last Wednesday, however, the floodgates were opened for what could be the start of the "Deng market" as books, posters and comics featuring the patriarch swept into stores ahead of his funeral on Tuesday.
In Shanghai, China's fast-beating mercantile heart, more than 80 branches of the state-run Xinhua bookstore had taken delivery of glossy Deng posters to meet anticipated demand, the Liberation Daily said.
Thousands of sets of the pictures, entitled "The Architect of China's Opening, Reform and Modernisation -- Deng Xiaoping", had been flown to Shanghai from publishing houses in various parts of China, it said.
Elsewhere, the People's Daily reported that "people old and young, men and women, including officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and young students" had waited in line for hours in Beijing to buy Deng portraits.
The state's rush to push out Deng memorabilia follows long years during which China's 1.2 billion people rarely saw even a photo of their paramount leader.
After the excesses of Mao worship during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Deng made a clear break in leadership style by insisting on a low public profile. On retiring from his last official post in 1991, he dropped almost completely from view.
There was a brief burst of Deng propaganda in 1992, when he successfully overruled communist hardliners and pushed his capitalist-style economic reforms to a new pitch. After that, however, Deng vanished again from the public eye.
His death at 92, however, freed Deng's heirs to make the most out of his political patronage and China's state stores and news media were ordered to begin cranking out memorials and mementoes as quickly as possible.
In one store in Shanghai, a city which has benefited greatly from Deng's reforms, biographies, collections of Deng's thoughts on socialism and economic development -- and handbooks explaining them -- were selling well.
"China has hope because of Deng Xiaoping," said one 73-year-old man poring over a selection of Deng's works at a bookshop on the city's premier shopping street, Nanjing Road.
He was buying a book for his grandson, he said, and had chosen "Xiaoping Says -- What is Socialism", which for 7.60 yuan ($0.91) uses simple cartoons to explain Deng's theories.
"He was the greatest leader China ever had," the man said.
"Look at what he did -- he brought the country out of chaos, he came up with the 'one country, two systems' theory for the return of Hong Kong, and he retired early. A truly great man."
Britain returns Hong Kong to China at midnight on June 30.

Australia's Prime Minister arrives in China on Friday to redefine Canberra as a friend of Beijing, which less than a year ago accused Australia of being party to U.S. attempts to contain China, business sources said.
John Howard wants to let China know that the business of Australia is business, said Bruce Dover, general manager of PDN-Xinren Information Technology Co, a joint venture of media giant News Corp and Chinese Communist Party newspaper People's Daily providing online computer technology information.
"I think the Chinese have made it clear that if you want to do business, then business becomes the business of government and that should be the priority," Dover said.
Sino-Australian relations, warm throughout the 13-year reign of the Australian Labour Party, started to chill once Howard's Liberal Party took over from Labour in elections in March 1996.
The relationship began to sour soon after the elections with the cancellation of a financial support scheme for Australian business in developing countries followed in September by a visit to Australia by Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
The nadir came in August 1996 when China accused Australia of moving too close to the United States, after U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry described Japan and Australia as the northern and southern anchors of Washington's Asian security arrangements.
"From this we can see that the United States is really thinking about using these two 'anchors' as the claws of a crab," the official People's Daily said in an editorial.
Australia's trade commissioner in Shanghai, Richard Pillow, said he saw no impact from the political issues on Australia's booming trade with China -- Australian exports to China grew 24 percent in 1996 to A$3.896 billion ($3 billion).
"Howard's visit is a proactive move to strengthen bilateral ties," Pillow said, adding that Australian companies were on a long list of international firms wanting a slice of the Chinese pie.
Howard arrives in Shanghai, China's biggest city and its mercantile heart, on Friday evening with a business delegation that includes representatives of Australian banks, insurance firms and commodity trading bodies.
A number of deals expected to be announced during the trip, including the opening in Beijing of a branch of ANZ Bank, business sources said.
In the lead-up to his five-day China trip, Howard emphasised the importance of Canberra's relationship with Beijing and of Australia's place in Asia, and said the level of the business delegation with him reflected this.
"It is probably the most senior and most broadly based representative business group to accompany an Australian prime minister on an overseas trip," he said.
In 1996, Australia's imports from China were worth A$4.122 billion, up from A$3.861 billion the year before, Australian officials said.

Old and young couples waltzed around the sunny marble plaza of Shanghai's People's Square on Thursday, many of them oblivious to the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
"I didn't know, but death befalls all men alike," a 70-year-old man said, quoting an ancient Chinese saying.
"The government has prepared for the transition for a long time," he added, before gliding off with his partner in time to music blaring from huge mushroom-shaped speakers.
People gather in the square every day to dance and exercise.
There was general apathy in Shanghai about the death of the man who led China for 18 years. The news that Deng died on Wednesday was first broadcast on Shanghai radio at 6 a.m. on Thursday (2200 GMT Wednesday) and on television an hour later.
"I heard the news when one of my neighbours stuck her head out of the window and shouted it to all and sundry," one young man said. "That happens whenever there is big news -- I can't remember what the last big news was."
Shanghai television stations broadcast programming beamed directly from Beijing's China Central Television, replaying over and over the news of Deng's death being read by black-suited announcers.
Shanghai radio stations broadcast dirges and historical accounts of Deng's contributions to China's political, social and economic development.
One station played speeches by the gravel-voiced Deng, whose pragmatic reforms transformed China from Stalinist state to economic powerhouse.
In Shanghai, China's biggest city and economic hub, many people were confident the government was well-prepared for a smooth transition of power.
"Chinese people are now more interested in evolution than revolution," a university graduate in his mid-twenties told Reuters. "The government's priority is social stability.
"Deng was very conservative, even Stalinistic in his thinking, so now maybe we will see younger people, people with more understanding of the way the world works, coming to the fore," he added.
"But change won't come for some time. The leaders will want to consolidate their positions before they make any changes," he said.
For one 16-year-old the greatest sadness of Deng's passing was that the elderly leader would not witness the handover of the British colony of Hong Kong to the mainland in mid-year -- one of his goals -- or see the rapid development of Shanghai.
"Deng came to Shanghai in the early 90s and told us to make great progress from year to year," he said. "Now he won't be able to see just how well we are doing."
"We have confidence in our leaders that things will be okay and that they are well prepared for the transition," said a middle aged woman exercising in the warmth of a sunny Shanghai morning.
"The markets will drop. I guess that will bring some good opportunities to make money," a taxi driver said when asked what difference Deng's passing would make. "But I don't buy shares so it makes no difference to me."
Shanghai's B share index fell sharply at the opening on Thursday morning on the news of Deng's death, but was up by the midday close by 0.29 percent to 65.318 points on volume of 21.245 million shares worth $8.62 million.
Brokers said heavy bargain-hunting and institutional buying that came in after the low opening was behind the rises.
"Whatever changes there are immediately after Deng's death, they won't have a lasting effect," another driver told Reuters.
"Give it a couple of days and everything will be back to normal," he said.

Chinese zinc producers are expected to take advantage of high international prices to export, though  this may lead to a domestic supply squeeze and firmer prices at home, Far East metal traders said on Monday.
With London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc prices having risen by around $50 a tonne since the start of 1997 to the highest levels in nearly two years, Chinese producers are seen accelerating sales, they said.  
Three month LME zinc was little changed at $1,137/39 a tonne in early trade in London on Monday, after a kerb close of $1,139 on Friday. The market was seen consolidating after a blistering rise that peaked last week at $1,157.

The Beijing trader said China had 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes of zinc metal available for export this year.  
China exports around a quarter of its annual zinc output.
Official figures show 1996 exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys rose to 226,777 tonnes, over 1995's 191,526 tonnes. December 1996 exports alone were 29,519 tonnes.
"We always believe Chinese metal will pressure the market," another Chinese source said. "Most people will see a good chance in the price rises."
But he said that once Chinese zinc producers saw they could get attractive export prices for their product, they could desert their domestic customers.  
"This will squeeze domestic supplies, then domestic prices will move up, then it makes more sense to keep the metal at home because the prices are better," he said. "Here we go again."
The Beijing trader said special high grade zinc accounted for around 30,000 tonnes of Chinese exports so far this year, with the same quantity of high grade metal.
Up to 70 percent of the exports had gone to end users, he and other sources said, much of it to Japan.  
Under its General System of Preferences (GSP) programme, Japan exempts metal imports from developing countries submitted for customs clearance before the April 1 start of the fiscal year.

Chinese soyoil buyers who have been selling cargoes back to the market are unlikely to unleash a flood of supplies originally destined for China, traders in the Far East said on Wednesday.
And soybeans and soybean meal have been flowing into the country, they added.
"It's logical," a Hong Kong trader said of the Chinese sell-backs. "It's not easy to sell in China and they immediately make a profit of US$10 a tonne that they definitely would not get in China."
U.S. exporters told Reuters in Chicago on Tuesday that China had resold between 25,000 and 50,000 tonnes of Argentine soyoil to two trading houses in recent days.
Uncertainty over Chinese government plans for issuing import quotas for soyoil could be behind the sell-backs, traders in the Far East said.
"I suspect they are scared the quotas won't be issued," a source in Singapore said, adding that market sentiment had swung violently from bullish to bearish in a matter of days.
"Buyers (in China) commit without downpayment, so you don't know what is going to happen about your money until the cargo arrives," another veteran China trader said.
Traders said little oil was actually on its way, and it was unlikely that washouts would become a feature of the market.
Soybeans and soybean meal were a different story, with trading sources reporting huge quantities of both commodities on the way to Chinese ports this month.
One trader in Singapore put the amount of soybean meal due to arrive in China this month at "way, way above half a million tonnes... and closer to one million tonnes".
The meal was coming from India, the U.S., Brazil and Argentina, he said without elaborating.
Another trading house source chipped in with 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes of soybean meal due to land in China this month.
He also said 430,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans would be arriving at Chinese ports in January.
Domestic soybean meal prices had already begun to soften as the imports arrived, sources said.
One source quoted meal in the southern province of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong, at 2,700 to 2,800 yuan (US$325-337) a tonne, down from closer to 3,000 yuan just weeks ago.
"With so much (meal) arriving and discharging, the price has already been impacted," the Hong Kong trader said.
"End-users are not very keen to talk about prices, they're going to buy on a hand-to-mouth basis because they're thinking if they buy now they have to pay cash and then pay storage.
"So he'll push the seller to the wire to get as good a price as possible," the trader said.
China's premier annual Spring Festival vacation, this year beginning on February 6, is traditionally preceded by a few weeks of extremely slow business and extremely tight cash.
Importers of soybeans were more than likely to have secured deposits from their buyers and "should be fairly safe," a Chinese source said.

- The one million tonnes of corn rotting in storage in China's northern port of Dalian will lead to tightened local supplies and force prices up before new crop is available at year-end, traders said on Wednesday.
Up to 50 percent of the stored corn is unfit for milling, a trader in Hong Kong said.
"I'd buy Dalian futures. Prices have got to start going up," he said.  
"The price will keep going up until January (because) the new crop won't be available until then, after the farmers have dried it and then want their money for Chinese New Year. If the domestic price keeps going up, what's the point of exporting," he said.
Even if exports were an option for China's grain authorities, they no longer make economic sense, traders said.
"What's the point? The inverse has gone. You can't do any better than low $180s (US$ a tonne) into Southeast Asia now. It just doesn't work," a U.S. trader in Hong Kong said.  
He said free on board (FOB) values in Dalian were 1,400 yuan ($168) per tonne for good quality corn.
Another regional trader, whose company has joint-venture interests in China's corn belt, said southern feed millers were rejecting the Dalian corn on the basis of quality.
"There is a lot of low quality corn around. We are FOB suppliers so in an atmosphere in which the feed millers are looking for any excuse not to accept cargo, we are having to turn it back," he said.  
"In the U.S., they could blend low quality with high quality to get a medium quality product. In China they can't do that because everything is bagged by hand," he said.
"So they will just have to sell it at a heavy discount."
The U.S. trader said China's recent demand for soymeal indicated a need for corn to mix with the protein product.
"Feed values are decent," he said. "Some livestock producers are starting to gear up again and will need corn."
The Dalian corn could be absorbed into the market over the coming three months, and the poorer quality corn could be used industrially, for instance to produce starch, he said.  
Exports were first mooted in early April, when market prices fell to less than 1,000 yuan ($120) a tonne in some areas of the northeast corn belt comprising Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning.
A few hundred thousand tonnes of Chinese corn did sell to Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, or was bartered for equipment supplied by Japanese food processing corporations as part of joint-venture deals, industry sources said.
China's government, however, remained adamant that its ban on corn exports, imposed in late 1994 when central reserves ran low, had not been lifted.  
Trade and industry sources said they saw official fears of inflation as the reason large-scale exports were not sanctioned. Of the sales that did go ahead, South Korean buyers paid $216.70 a tonne cost and freight (C&amp;F) when U.S. corn was arriving at Asian ports for more than $230 a tonne.
China could easily have sold up to two million tonnes at the time, making substantial hard currency profits and helping increase prices for impoverished farmers, traders said.  
Chinese corn output in 1996 has been projected by the official media to hit 112 million tonnes. Official figures put 1995 corn production at 101 million tonnes. Annual demand is 100-115 million tonnes.
China's corn reserves have been reported at 30 million tonnes. New crop will be harvested from late September to November, and should start arriving at market, in a dried state, a month or so after that.

British speciality chemicals group Laporte Plc on Monday reported higher-than-expected annual profits, evidence that its recovery was firmly on track.
Laporte, whose value tumbled in November 1995 after a shock profits warning, said pretax profit before exceptional items rose 12 percent to 127.0 million pounds ($203 million) last year, beating analysts' forecasts of between 114.3 million and 124.0 million.
After exceptional charges, pre-tax profits were 78.7 million pounds, compared with 24.5 million in 1995.
Shareholders, who saw the dividend frozen at the half-year stage, received a five percent rise in the full-year payout to 24.25 pence.
The results provided an early boost to Laporte's shares, which were up 18 pence at 686-1/2 in mid-morning trade after touching a high of 696 pence.
Laporte, whose products supply a wide range of customers including the drugs, electronics and food industries, has undergone a major shake-up since chief executive Jim Leng took the helm in October 1995.
Leng, forced to issue a profit warning within weeks of taking charge, introduced sweeping management changes and launched a two-year restructuring programme which included selling around one fifth of Laporte's business.
In December, Laporte sold most of its European adhesives business, including Evode, to France's Elf Atochem for 110 million pounds, and Leng told Reuters that it had received "some initial expressions of interest" for its U.S. and Italian adhesives operations.
Laporte, which started 1996 with debts of 180 million pounds on its books, ended the year with net cash of 13 million pounds, putting it in a strong position to start buying businesses in more proftiable sectors like electronic chemicals and performance materials.
But Leng said it did not intend to rush into purchases, commenting: "It is not burning a hole in our pocket. We have got a business which is growing and we will carefully and analytically decide what we are going to do."
Leng said Laporte intended to take positions in international growth sectors which could not be entered easily by new competitors.
He added that Laporte was on target to achieve annual cost savings of 10 million pounds by the end of 1997 as a result of the shake-up of its operations in which 34 percent of its operating units were sold last year.
"It has been a good all-round performance.. every business division made positive cash flow contributions," Leng said.
Profit margins improved to 12.9 percent overall in 1996 from 11.8 percent in 1995.
"Our target is to get closer to 15 percent and we made some good progrss on that," Leng said, adding that he wanted to reach a position where "no business has less than 10 percent with the group at an average of 15 percent."
"We won't do that overnight and we won't get there this year," he added.
Leng expects raw material prices to be fairly stable this year but said sterling's strength "will dilute our progress".
"If fourth-quarter rates applied all year, it would affect profits and sales by 50 million and five million pounds, respectively," he said. "It is a big challenge for UK Plc." ($ = 0.625 British Pounds)

British textiles group Coats Viyella Plc is "well placed" for a recovery in profitablity, its retiring chief executive Neville Bain said on Thursday.
Bain told Reuters in an interview following publication of results that showed a sharp fall in 1996 profits: "We are poised for a period of growth from the base we have put in place." He added, "The company is well placed to move ahead in 1997 and future years, although the extent of that does depend on some factors outside our control," including exchange rates and economic trends.  
Bain said he felt now was the right time to stand down as chief executive after 6-1/2 years, and added that he hoped to take up other directorships and chairmanships.
"We agreed at the end of last year that this would be a good time to go," Bain said.
He said he would continue to be available to assist Coats Viyella. Bain said his successor, former McKechnie Plc chief executive Michael Ost, "has a very good track record, and he did not expect him to change the group's strategy.  
"This year's results, in difficult circumstances, are exactly in line with expectations and the trading statement that we made at the end of last year," said Bain. "Underlying profit is down by seven percent, which is a tad disappointing, but given the state of this industry that certainly would augur well in (comparison with) our peer group."
Bain said cost savings from the group's reorganisation, which led to charges of 54.9 million stg against 1996 profits, were flowing through faster than expected. Savings in 1996 totalled 12 million pounds against a prediction of 10 million stg.  
Bain said he was "confident" that savings of at least 35 million stg would be achieved in 1998.
He highlighted the performance of the group's home furnishings division, where operating profits rose 42 percent to 12.5 mllion stg, and the continued strength of fashion retail, which he said had built profits to 13.1 million stg in 1996 from around 2.0 million over the past five years.
But he said the performance of clothing, where profits fell 12 percent to 19.1 million stg, "was not satisfactory." He said the division had been affected by disruption from restructuring, which involves relocation of a number of operations.  
Bain said he was confident management "is doing the right things to secure greater profits into the future, but it is taking us a bit longer than anticipated." He added that group was looking for a "significant improvement" on the division's profit margins of between three and four percent.
The core threads division, where operating profits fell 10.4 percent to 90.3 million stg, had enjoyed a stronger fourth quarter after a weak first half, Bain said.

British chemicals group Albright &amp; Wilson Plc said on Thursday that it planned to focus its business increasingly on emerging markets, with particular emphasis on South America, China and India.
"These are very important for the growth of Albright &amp; Wilson," chief executive Robin Paul told Reuters in an interview.
Paul, who steered the company back onto the stock market in 1995 after 17 years as part of Tenneco Inc, said expansion was likely to come through partnerships and the acquisition of majority stakes in partner companies where appropriate.
Last year Albright &amp; Wilson took a majority stake in an Indian partner, and is now stepping up its activities in phosphates and surfactants there. The company, which announced a 13.6 percent rise in 1996 pre-tax profits, also said it had appointed Gabriel Kow as president of its Asia Pacific operations. Kow joins the group from Glaxo Wellcome Plc.
"We continue to believe China is a very important region for Albright &amp; Wilson," said Paul, who said Kow had "a very good understanding of China and its markets."  
The company said 1996 produced "a satisfactory result in an environment that has offered little assistance in the various markets in which the group operates." Paul said rises in raw material prices, which added 40 million stg to costs in 1995, had stabilised, with just four million stg added to costs last year.
In the key phosphates business, which goes into products ranging from soft drinks to washing powders, sales rose eight percent to 361.1 million stg, including associate companies, but operating profits fell 7.5 percent to 47.0 million stg, with margins down to 13.0 percent from 15.2 percent.  
Albright &amp; Wilson is the world's largest producer of wet phophoric acid. Paul said phosphates had been affected by "a number of special factors" in 1996, including higher Chinese phosphorus prices and costs and distortions linked to capacity increases and refurbishment of plants in England and Mexico.
"These factors are largely behind us," said Paul. "Chinese phosphorous prices have started to come down compared to the middle of 1996." Demand was strong: "We are sold out in phosphates," he said.  
Paul said promised progress had been made in both the surfactants business, which supplies wetting and foaming agents for items like toiletries and detergents, and in specialty chemicals, whose products include flame retardants and chemicals for water treatment.
At surfactants operating profits leaped 76 percent to 14.1 million stg last year on sales of 309.0 million stg, with margins rising to 4.6 percent from 2.5 percent. Paul said the division was on target to achieve margins of between six and eight percent "by the end of this year."
At Specialties, where the group is targeting margins of 15 percent, operating profits rose 33 percent to 16.9 million stg on sales of 187.5 million, with margins improving to 9.0 percent from 6.6 percent.
Paul said the strength of sterling had little impact on 1996 results. In 1997 Paul noted that "some people are talking about a 10 percent (impact) on profits if these rates continue for the whole year," but he added that this did not take into account the company's efforts to contain costs and a beneficial impact from lower raw material prices.
The chief executive said the group was slightly ahead on its goal of generating 20 percent of sales from new products by 1998, noting the successful launch of a biocidem Tolcide THPS, during 1996.
Paul, who retires from the board in July, said the company wanted to "keep the option" of buying back shares. However he added "we believe we'll have other opportunites to use the strong balance sheet and cash flow rather than buying back shares, but we'll keep it under review."

KS Biomedix Holdings Plc said on Tuesday that it was nearing a major breakthrough in the formulation of sheep monoclonal antibodies.
In an interview with Reuters, managing director Kim Tan said the tiny biotech group was "very close" to being able to create sheep antibodies artificially, a key step in a process which KS Biomedix hopes will lead to ground-breaking drugs for cancer and viral infections.  
Tan said he hoped that the second key step, humanising the artifically-created antibody by attaching it to part of a human antibody gene, would be achieved this year.
Scientists across the drug industry believe that antibodies, which are proteins produced by the body to fight off disease, could be used like torpedoes to carry cancer-killing drugs direct to cancerous cells. They would bind themselves to affected cells but leave healthy tissue alone.
KS Biomedix is pioneering development of sheep antibodies in place of the mouse or rat antibodies which are the current mainstay of research.  
Malaysian-born Tan, who has done much of the work himself, says sheep antibodies are much better at binding to targeted cells than mouse antibodies and promise to pack far more punch.
"We are saying that we think the mouse antibody approach is correct, but because mouse antibodies don't bind as tightly we think sheep antibodies will be better," Tan said, adding "perhaps 10,000 times better."
The technology receved a boost last October when Swiss drugs giant Hoffman-La Roche asked KS Biomedix to develop a sheep-based antibody for an as yet undisclosed disease area.  
Tan said he believed other companies would follow when the superior characteristics of the sheep product were demonstrated.
"We are making biological missiles that can carry a variety of payloads," Tan said. "It is like the Ariane rockets - we don't care whose satellite we deliver, we'll launch it and get it there."
Tan said the technology could revolutionise treatment of cancer, especially in comparison with the "machine-gun approach" of chemotherapy. He said that with antibody technology a cancer treatment could be administered "14 times in a week compared with once every two weeks for chemotherapy."  
KS Biomedix, which was founded in 1991 and listed on the Alternative Investment Market in January 1996, is initially targetting colon, breast and small cell lung cancer in cooperation with a number of British hospital and university research teams.
But Tan said the basic technology, which would be licensed to other drug companies, "is capable of hundreds of products," including combating viruses like hepatitis and HIV. Tan said KS Biomedix, which farms most of its research work out to academic researchers, was now looking for partners in this field.
Tan told Reuters that the company was unlikley to have to return to the market for further funding. He said he was confident that income from two drugs in Phase II trials, for rheumatoid arthritis and osteo arthritis, would help to fund the rest of the company's drug development programme.

Cambridge Antibody Technology Group Plc (CAT) said late on Wednesday that it expected to forge a major genetics alliance in the next 12 months.
In an interview with Reuters, chief executive officer David Chiswell said a link would bring together CAT's ability to use the body's own defenses against disease with the thousands of potential disease targets being unlocked by work to crack the genetic code.
"We will do at least one major new deal which will acquire targets...in the next 12 months," Chiswell said.
There has been speculation that CAT, which hopes to float on the stock exchange before the end of March, could forge a link with SmithKline Beecham Plc, which has established a strong position in breaking the genetic code, or genome, through a link with Human Genome Sciences.
But Chiswell declined to be drawn on the identity of any likely partner.
"It will be a genomics-element deal," he said. "Whether it's with a genomics firm or whether its with a pharmaceutical company with access to genomics we are leaving in the air."
CAT is pioneering work in human antibodies, which are produced by cells in the immune system to help combat invading substances like viruses and bacteria. Scientists believe antibodies could be used like missiles to target drugs exactly where they are needed in the body.
Other companies, like Britain's Celltech Group Plc, have concentrated on developing mice antibodies. Chiswell said CAT has effectively "captured" the hundreds of millions of variations in antibodies which the human body produces to protect itself.
CAT, which grew out of work conducted by the Medical Research Council, already licenses its technology to major companies including Genentech Inc, Eli Lilly &amp; Co chemicals  and Pfizer Inc.
Chiswell said CAT's techniques allow companies to test for potential antibody targets in a matter of days rather than up to six months with other methods.
"You give them a huge benefit in trying to get a handle on the function of any particular gene sequence...(perhaps) a ten- or a hundred-fold improvement in productivity in that particular activity."
But Chiswell has ambitious goals for CAT's own drug development programme, which is still in its infancy. CAT hopes to raise 30 to 35 million stg through its flotation, valuing it at 85 to 100 million stg. CAT plans to use the funds to develop over the next two years to the point where it can "put three or four new clinical programmes in place every year from 2000."
CAT is developing a human antibody drug with potential against rheumatoid arthritis with Germany's BASF AG, which is expected to start clinical trials in the next few months. A similar drug could be targeted against Crohn's disease, a poorly treated illness in the small intestine.
Both would compete directly with mouse antibody products being developed by Celltech and Centocor Inc of the United States, but Chiswell said CAT's product should prove to be more easily tolerated by the human body. Other programmes include drugs to improve the success of operations for detached retina and glaucoma, and Chiswell said CAT hoped to have antibody drugs for cancer and obesity in the clinic in 1998 or 1999.

Textiles group Coats Viyella Plc, reporting lower first-half results, said on Wednesday it is confident it is on course for a bounce back to profit growth in 1997 as it puts a restructuring behind it.
The first 17.2 million pound chunk of reorganisation costs announced in March caused first-half pretax profit to tumble 34 percent to 47 million pounds ($73.09 million), with the remaining 38 million pounds of costs all to be charged against second-half earnings.
Chief executive Neville Bain told Reuters that "charges will be taken this year so 1997 will be put on a clean basis going forward" and predicted "a good return to profit" next year.
The announcement from Coats, whose products range from bath towels to precision engineering components, ended uncertainty about how the charges would fall.
An upbeat statement about prospects in key markets, in contrast with the gloomier tone of some competitors, helped to boost Coats' shares by 4-1/2 pence to 164 pence by late morning.
Bain said he is confident the group will achieve its cumulative annual cost saving targets of 10 million pounds in the second half of 1996, 25 million pounds in 1997 and 35 million in 1998.
But he said not all of this will reach the bottom line as the group spends money shifting an increasing amount of clothing production to lower-cost areas such as Morocco, eastern Europe and parts of Asia.
The reorganisation involves shedding 7,750 jobs, including nearly 3,000 in Britain.
Rival Courtaulds Textiles Plc announced on Tuesday that it is belatedly following Coats' lead in looking abroad to tackle continued margin pressures.
Coats' first-half operating profits on continuing operations slipped to 78.0 million pounds from 87.3 million, largely due to declines at its threads division, which produces thread for sewing and knitting and is the world's second-biggest zipper maker.
Bain said the decline was "largely due to Brazil and Turkey in the first-half of 1995 having exceptional levels of profits. We said at the time that was unsustainable."
Coats expects a "worthwhile" improvement in second-half results year-on-year before charges, with the key September to December period accounting for half its annual profits.
It said trading conditions "appear to be showing some signs of improvement", with a return of consumer confidence in Britain and normal weather patterns expected to help the second-half.
Bain said there was continued progress at its Jaeger and Viyella fashion retail chains, and the group's home furnishings business is struggling to keep up with demand caused by a "substantial" pick-up in the British housing market.
"The USA is picking up and we think it will good to us, especially in threads and engineering," Bain added, while demand in the rest of Europe is expected to remain mixed. ($1=.6430 Pound)

The world's biggest prescription drugs company, Glaxo Wellcome Plc, announced an 18 percent leap in pre-tax profits Thursday but said life would be tougher after its best-selling drug loses its U.S. patent in July.
Pre-tax profits climbed to 2.964 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) from 2.505 billion ($4.04 billion), in the middle of analysts' expectations. Sales rose 9 percent to 8.341 billion pounds ($13.45 billion), and shareholders were rewarded with a 13 percent rise in the dividend to 34.0 pence.
Sales of Glaxo's gastric ulcer treatment Zantac fell 14 percent last year, but at 1.931 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) it continued to be the world's biggest-selling drug, a spot it has held since 1986. Zantac has single-handedly transformed Glaxo, which merged with rival Wellcome in 1995, into a huge international player.
Sales of its second-biggest seller, herpes treatment Zovirax, which has already lost most of its key patents, were steady at 812 million pounds ($1.3 billion).
Glaxo warned that the best it could hope for over the next two years would be to "at least maintain" its profits at the 1996 level.
"The tough period is mid-1997 to mid-1998 when Zantac will come under severe generic pressure in the U.S.," Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Sir Richard Sykes said in a telephone interview.
But he added: "If you take Zantac out we have a 6.4 billion pound ($10.3 billion) business growing at 14 percent. That underlying growth is a very clear indication of the strength of the group going forward."
Sykes noted that sales of Zantac fell by 324 million pounds ($523 million) last year, while a portfolio of newer products launched since 1990 saw sales rise by 650 million pounds ($1.05 billion) to 2.0 billion pounds ($3.2 billion).
"Our responsibility is to grow those new products to maintain these two (sales) lines in balance as much as possible. It is a balancing act," he said.
The best performers included Glaxo Wellcome's rejuvenated HIV and AIDS treatments. Retrovir and Epivir are at the cornerstone of new cocktails of drugs that have shown startling success in reducing the levels of the virus in the blood to virtually undetectable levels, giving Glaxo Wellcome the lion's share of a rapidly expanding market.
"Today we have 57 percent of the AIDS market and I don't see why we won't continue to be a very major player," Sykes said.
Other big sellers included asthma drugs Serevent and Flixotide and migraine drug Imigran, whose U.S. sales leaped by 69 percent last year.
Despite persistent speculation that Glaxo Wellcome will get onto the acquisition trail again as soon as its debt levels allow, Sykes said there had been a clear dissipation of the pressures for mega-mergers. He said Glaxo Wellcome's future expansion was likely to be "incremental."
"The pressures of the early 1990s have changed somewhat in the big markets. The bigger companies get, the more difficult it is to buy them or merge, so the way forward will be much more looking at regional and local opportunities and building these as opportunities come along," he said.

Drug discovery company Chiroscience Group Plc said on Monday that its research alliance with ophthalmic specialist Alcon Laboratories Inc would allow it to test its leading drug programmes in a new therapeutic area.
In a telephone interview with Reuters, chief executive John Padfield said the link with the Nestle SA unit would also give Chiroscience access to Alcon's skills in rapid screening of potential new drugs.
Earlier the company said Alcon would put Chiroscience's library of compounds through its own high-intensity biological test system, retaining rights to develop any ophthalmic and optic drugs that resulted. Alcon is one of the world's biggest eyecare companies, making contact lenses and solutions as well as prescription drugs.
"Ophthalmology is an area of growing importance," Padfield said, which was likely to benefit from ageing populations in the developed world and increasing expenditure in developing countries. He said it was also a "niche area" with very few competitors.
Padfield said the programme with Alcon would focus on Chiroscience's work in MMP inhibitors, PNP inhibitors and PDE IV inhibitors.
Chiroscience is working on drugs for arthritis and cancer using MMP inhibitors, but Padfield said these may also prove useful in areas like corneal ulceration and recovery from eye surgery because of the role they played in healing wounds.
Padfield told Reuters that the group's lower profile work on inhibiting another class of enzyme, PNPs, could also receive a boost, with potential in corneal transplantation. Padfield said initial results suggested that PNP inhibitors could be more effective in helping prevent rejection of transplants than the current lead drug, cyclosporine, marketed by Novartis AG as Sandimmum.
A third major part of Chiroscience's novel drug programme involving the PDE IV enzyme, which is implicated in major inflammatory diseases like asthma and arthritis, could also be extended to inflammatory diseases of the eye.
Padfield said the agreement did not extend to the genetic research being conducted by Darwin Molecular Corp, the Seattle-based biotech company which Chiroscience bought in November 1996. But he noted work done by Alcon and the University of Iowa on isolating a gene linked to glaucoma, and said the two companies will "be able to talk about what we have in Seattle."
Padfield said access to Alcon's rapid-screening skills for new drugs would "offset some of the need to invest" in new technology. Chiroscience will have rights to all non-ophthalmic discoveries made through the alliance.
Padfield declined to disclose financial details of the arrangement, but said "most of the money" would come from product royalties and milestone payments. "There is a bit of cash up front," he added.
Shares in Chiroscience were up 7 pence at 371 in early afternoon trading.

A buoyant SmithKline Beecham Plc played down talk of another mega-merger on Tuesday after posting a bumper set of profits for 1996 and unveiling a raft of new drug projects.
Pre-tax profits at the Anglo-U.S. group surged 14 percent to 1.545 billion pounds ($2.48 billion) last year, towards the lower end of analysts' forecasts, while sales climbed 13 percent to 7.93 billion pounds.
The company said it would have done even better but for the strong pound, which cut fourth-quarter pre-tax profits by 35 million pounds and the full-year figure by around 29 million.
Shareholders were rewarded with a 25 percent rise in the annual dividend to 17.85 pence, while shares climbed 14-1/2 pence to 896-1/2 pence in late afternoon trading.
Chief executive Jan Leschly said the results were a vindication of the company's strategy, including the move into gene-based drug discovery, high investment in research and development and the 1994 acquisition of Sterling Healthcare, which boosted sales of over-the-counter drugs.
"Our strategy is working," Leschly told reporters. In an echo of the independent line consistently taken by British rival Zeneca Group Plc, he added: "We feel we have the size that is big enough to compete and at the same time keep double-digit sales growth."
Underlining SmithKline Beecham's strength, he said five new drugs, all with potential to sell between 300 and 500 million pounds a year, had gone into late-stage clinical trials.
SmithKline Beecham is frequently touted as a potential merger candidate, not least because of the ambitions and track record of its management.
But Leschly, who presided over a spending spree by the group in 1994, ruled out any merger that did not boost the drug pipeline.
And he criticised the rationale behind last year's fusion of Swiss groups Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG as an example of scale without underlying growth. "If Novartis is going to be successful, it has to be based on products in the pipeline. It doesn't help just to make it bigger," Leschly said.
SmithKline's own prescription drug sales rose 14 percent to 4.76 billion pounds, with growth once again fuelled by products launched within the last five years.
Antibiotic Augmentin and fast-growing anti-depressant Paxil/Seroxat were the biggest selling treatments, both helped by new formulations and indications.
Sales of Augmentin rose four percent to 868 million pounds, while those of Paxil, which competes with Eli Lilly &amp; Co's blockbuster anti-depressant Prozac, rose 42 percent to 706 million pounds.
Finance director Hugh Collum told Reuters that Paxil, which is also prescribed for panic attacks, was likely to be the group's biggest seller by the end of the year, chasing Prozac's $2.3 billion annual sales hard.
At consumer healthcare, which sells a raft of products including Aquafresh toothpaste, health drink Horlicks and over-the-counter digestive drug Tagamet, sales jumped 17 percent. Anti-smoking patches and chewing gum Nicoderm and Nicorette were star performers, clocking up combined sales of 221 million pounds in their first year on sale.
Collum said diagnostics business Clinical Laboratories might now be back on track after running into trouble over changes in U.S. reimbursement rules. He added that a dispute with the U.S. government over alleged overcharging was likely to be resolved in the next couple of months. ($1=.6227 Pound)

Shares in British drugs company Zeneca Group Plc had another busy day on Friday as the bid rumour mill again started churning, overshadowing a key patent victory in the United States.
Zeneca shares climbed 35 pence to 18.55 pounds ($30.06) in late afternoon trading after a U.S. Appeals Court threw out a patent challenge to one of its top-selling drugs, breast cancer treatment Nolvadex.
The ruling, which follows a U.S. district court decision in Zeneca's favour a year ago, means that Canadian generic drug maker Novopharm Ltd will not be able to market a generic version of Nolvadex before Zeneca's patent runs out in 2002.
But analysts said the ruling was widely expected and pointed the finger instead at the Swiss magazine Cash for driving up Zeneca's shares.
Cash said Swiss giant Roche Holdings AG was about to announce an agreed takeover of the British group.
Stephen Putnam, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said: "I think this rise has more to do with rumours about a Roche bid. I can't believe anybody thought there would be a different outcome (to the Novopharm appeal)."
In an unsourced article, Cash said Roche was planing to offer between 21 and 22 pounds per share for Zeneca, which it would then break up, selling off the agricultural chemical and specialty seeds divisions as well as Roche's own fragrances and aromas division.
Both companies, increasingly weary of the mounting bid speculation, again declined to comment. But London analysts laughed the suggestion out of court.
"Frankly, for 21 pounds they'd be lucky to get the agricultural chemicals division. I think the bidding would start at 30 pounds," said one analyst who asked not to be identified. "Zeneca is not interested and doesn't need to embark on a merger," he added.
Zeneca's patent victory against Novopharm has, however, strengthened its main attraction for any possible bidder -- its strong product portfolio.
Nolvadex is the world's top-selling breast cancer treatment, with sales of 2.7 billion pounds since its launch. Last year Zeneca sold 332 million pounds worth of Nolvadex, making it one of its biggest money spinners.
Zeneca began legal action against Novopharm in January 1995 after the Canadian company tried to get U.S. regulatory approval for a generic version of Nolvadex, also known as Tamoxifen Citrate.
Two other patent challenges for Nolvadex in the U.S, against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc and Pharmachemie BV, are outstanding. A third, against Lemmon Co, was dropped after Lemmon withdrew its marketing application.
Kevin Scotcher, analyst at NatWest Markets, said Zeneca's patent position was now much more secure as a result of the Novopharm ruling. "This case must strengthen their hand significantly in those other cases," he said.
Novopharm has been very active in legal challenges recently, last week successfully winning the right to market a generic version of one of the world's biggest-selling drugs, Glaxo Wellcome Plc's Zantac, from July.

British insurance group Norwich Union said on Tuesday it will float on the London Stock Exchange on June 16.
The company, Britain's third largest life insurer, expects to allocate around 1.3 billion free shares to 2.9 million qualifying members as part of its plan to drop its mutual status and become a public limited company.
Norwich also hopes to raise 1.75 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) of fresh capital through an offer of new shares. Existing members will be able to buy the shares at a discount, the size of which will be announced on May 21.
Last month Norwich members voted overwhelmingly in favour of its conversion proposals, the first by a mutually owned British insurer.
The flotation will value it at around five billion pounds, ranking it among the country's 50 largest companies.
Norwich members wishing to participate in the public offering will have to apply for a minimum of 400 pounds worth of shares. There will be an upper ceiling on applications by members of 100,000 pounds.
Non-members, who will not receive any discounts, will have to apply for at least 1,000 pounds worth of shares and those registering with the Norwich will be sent a mini-prospectus from May 21.
Around 1.5 billion pounds of the money raised will go into the existing with-profits fund to enable the company to keep up benefits to policyholders.
The balance, less the 120 million pound cost of the flotation, will be used for corporate purposes.
Around 1.8 million "with profit" members will net an average of 800 pounds worth of free shares under the plans. They will receive a minimum of 300 shares with additional shares based on the value and duration of their policies as at October 1, 1996.
Another one million "non-profit" policyholders will receive a fixed allocation of 150 shares worth between 330 and 400 pounds.
Norwich sent British and Irish members a booklet today, providing information on how to buy shares at a discount.
Application forms and a mini-prospectus will be sent to members along with details of the size of the discount on May 21.
A June 10 deadline has been set for the return of the forms and payment ahead of the start of trading in the shares on June 16.
Norwich said it was setting up a single company personal equity plan (PEP) for which there will be no initial charge. For plans opened within 42 days of flotation, the first year's management fee will be waived. ($ = 0.618 British Pounds)

Lloyd's of London, beset by huge losses until 1993, is focused on its future and the needs of its clients after one of the most dramatic periods in its 300-year history, chairman Sir David Rowland said.
In the insurance market's 1996 report and accounts published on Wednesday, Rowland said that Lloyd's had to continue to offer first-rate security to keep the confidence of its policyholders.
It also had to "strive to make its internal arrangements as transparent and equitable as possible".
"The forces that shape the future must be the needs of our clients and our determination to preserve the unique marketplace, with its powerful attractions to clients and brokers alike, that is both our inheritance and the source of our future prosperity," said Rowland.
The successful implementation of last year's reconstruction package and the settling of the "great majority of the litigation that beset us" had removed huge uncertainties, said Rowland.
Huge losses run up between 1988 and 1993 threatened the future of the insurance market before the 'Reconstruction &amp; Renewal' (R&amp;R) plan was put in place last year.
Since the completion of R&amp;R, the priority has shifted to debt collection and so far more than 1,300 writs have been issued against "Names" -- investors whose capital underpins the market.
Lloyd's members who did not accept the R&amp;R settlement or did so without paying in full, still owe Lloyd's over 600 million pounds ($970 million).
Whilst a significant amount of this is uncollectable Lloyd's was "absolutely determined to recover as much debt as we can, in the shortest possible time", said Ron Sandler the market's chief executive.
The post-reconstruction solvency return showed a margin of total assets over total liabilities of 4.7 billion pounds, exceeding the statutory margin of solvency by more than five times.
The Corporation of Lloyd's contributed 486.4 million pounds to the settlement. The Corporation's balance sheet shows a deficiency of 239 million pounds, reflecting a 292 liability connected with the settlement, offset by 53 million pounds of net assets.
The creation of five new business units at the beginning of this year was designed to make the Corporation of Lloyd's more transparent and accountable to those whom it served and to promote more commercial pricing mechanisms and management disciplines, said Sandler.
Progress in the implementation of the reorganisation had been encouraging and business plans for each were to be published shortly. ($ = 0.618 British Pounds)

The prospect of a shake-up at Sedgwick Group looked possible on Wednesday after news that a U.S. fund manager known for his aggressive attitude to underperforming companies had taken a sizeable stake in the insurance broker.
Chicago-based David Herro, instrumental two years ago in ousting Maurice Saatchi as chairman of the advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, since renamed Cordiant, now owns over three percent of Sedgwick through his mutual fund, Oakmark International.
A spokeswoman for Sedgwick said it had held several meetings with Herro as part of its normal programme of contacts with institutional investors, but declined further comment.
Herro led a shareholders revolt against Saatchi in a battle over boardroom pay in 1994.
Saatchi left the firm he founded with his brother, but took some of the group's leading clients with him.
Shares in Sedgwick, which has made no secret of its  desire to take part in the quickening consolidation in the insurance broking sector, rose three pence to 127.5 pence.
The shares have rebounded from a year's low of 113 pence only last week, a gain of nearly 13 percent.
Herro's shareholding may signal renewed pressure on the company to do something following the poor performance of the shares in recent years.
They have fallen nearly 40 percent since the beginning of 1992, compared with a 71 percent advance in Britain's leading shares over the same period.
A demand for action could come in three weeks time at the group's annual meeting on April 24.
There are fears that Sedgwick may have missed the boat after a stream of mergers and takeovers among rival firms.
Just last month Marsh &amp; Mclennan announced a $1.8 billion merger with Johnson &amp; Higgins to form the world's largest broker.
The $1.2 billion merger of Aon and Alexander &amp; Alexander in the U.S. last December, followed swiftly on the heels of Aon's purchase of Bain Hogg from Inchcape. JIB Group and Lloyd Thompson merged at the end of last year to form Jardine Lloyd Thompson.
This has left Britains's two largest brokers, Sedgwick and Willis Corroon somewhat stranded and has raised the prospect of the two being pushed into each others arms as the only solution to their current difficulties.
Willis has always brushed off suggestions it may be interested in teaming up with its British rival.
But Sedgwick chairman Sax Riley, until recently group chief executive, has repeatedly refused to rule out a merger.
After the results in February which saw a five percent rise in pre-tax profits to 95.5 million pounds ($155.2 million) Riley said the group continued to look at opportunities in the sector and predicted a second round of consolidation was about to begin in the industry.
The attraction of mergers are the huge cost savings firms can strip out. Marsh &amp; Mclennan predicted annual cost savings of at least $150 million following its March deal.
However, mergers also raise potentially big  difficulties in marrying often very different corporate cultures and the risks of damage to staff morale or loss of key personnel have to be weighed carefully.
But insurance broking is suffering from overcapacity and stagnant or declining commissions. Insurance premiums, the basis for commissions, have slumped in the past decade.
There has also been a trend of companies taking on more risk themselves and paying fees for risk management advice rather than commission for broking. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

Members of the Norwich Union are to receive 3.1 billion pounds ($5.1 billion) worth of free shares after they overwhelmingly approved plans on Friday to float the insurance group on the London Stock Exchange in June.
The company, Britain's third largest life insurer, said that nearly 99 percent of members who voted had backed management's proposals to drop mutual status and become a public company.
The results of a postal vote announced at a sparsely attended extraordinary general meeting showed 21,000 votes against the plans dwarfed by over 1.85 million members in favour.
Less than 200 Norwich Union members turned up to the meeting held at the London Arena in the capital's Dockland, but a number who did voiced their opposition to the flotation which will see members net an average 800 pounds worth of shares.
Another one million "non-profit" policyholders of the group will receive a fixed handout of shares worth beween 330 and 400 pounds.
Norwich Union chief executive Allan Bridgewater welcomed the result. "We are delighted to have received a resounding endorsement from our members for the flotation proposal and thank them for voting in such numbers," he said.
There were few doubts about the outcome of the vote which follows a series of similar moves by British building societies in the past year.
The Halifax, Alliance and Leicester, and the Woolwich have all received unequivocal backing for plans to convert to banks which have also involved distributing hundreds of pounds worth of shares to members.
Norwich Union also plans to raise 1.75 billion pounds of fresh capital through an offer of new shares in May and Bridegewater said he hoped a considerable part of this would come from existing members increasing their shareholdings.
They will be able to purchase the shares at a discount, the size of which has yet to be announced.
The demutualisation and flotation of the company, the first by a mutually-owned British insurer, will value Norwich Union at around five billion pounds and rank it among Britain's 50 largest companies.
Norwich Union's 10,000 employees will share in the giveawy, receiving 150 shares each.
The two million with-profit members will receive a minimum of 300 shares with additional shares based on the value and duration of their policy holdings as at October 1, 1996.
But the giving up of mutual status, entailing the transfer of ownership from policyholders to shareholders is an emotive issue.
Supporters of mutuality argue that it gives members undiluted exposure to the profits of the business without the need to pay dividends to shareholders.
The attraction of demutualisation is the access to capital it gives. It was the need for capital, with the greater investment flexibility it brings, which drove Scoottish Amicable to put itself up for auction in February.
But there are questionmarks over how long Norwich Union will be able to hold onto its independence.
Australian mutual AMP which lost out in its fight for Scottish Amicable to Britain's Prudential last month, has made no secret of its desire to expand in Britain.
Interest may also come from Europe with a number of continetal insurers including Dutch insurer Aegon and Germany's Allianz looking for a foothold in Britain.
Norwich Union argues its plans will offer more scope for developing the business in the future and allow the separation of the group's life operations from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business.
A court hearing formally to approve the proposals will take place on April 23.

Britain's Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday as the ambitious takeover bid led by 31-year-old Andrew Regan crumbled in a flurry of legal writs.
But the company's satisfaction at seeing off Regan may be tempered by the realisation that its battle for independence may have only just begun.
While the chances of Regan ever succeeding in his bold attempt to buy the group and sell off its disparate parts were probably always slim, the move has alerted many in the industry to the underlying and, some say, under-utilised CWS assets.
The view among banking observers was that CWS remains in play whatever the outcome of the Regan episode.
"It's not the end of saga. It may be the end of Regan's offer but that's not the same thing. Regan's done a lot of other people's work for them," commented one banking source.
In favour of its hopes of staying independent, CWS boasts a convoluted ownership and voting structure which complicates any hostile takeover attempt.
But Regan, who had planned to mount a bid approach through a unit of his Lanica Trust Plc, has identified both a wealth of underperforming assets and possible purchasers in the event of any break-up, and put in place the financing to back it.
It was not the deal that ultimately foundered, but doubts about Regan himself that allowed CWS to claim victory in what may prove to be only round one of its fight for independence.
Last week, the group turned in a 10 million pound ($16.2 million) fall in profits for the year before tax and distribution to its members of 68.2 million pounds on flat sales of around three billion pounds.
A 21 percent rise in trading profits in its banking arm was more than offset by falls in its trading operations.
Regan planned a 1.2 billion pound offer for CWS through a company specially set up for the purpose - Galileo Group - intending to sell off CWS businesses which include supermarkets, banking, insurance as well as opticians, chemists and funeral parlours.
Allied Irish Banks confirmed it was among those interested in Co-op businesses, and supermarket chain J.Sainsbury was also reported to be among those lining up to purchase the assets.
The plans foundered amid allegations of financial irregularities regarding an earlier deal Regan had been involved in concerning a food supply agreement with the CWS and Hobson Plc, which was run by Regan at that time.
CWS has launched criminal proceedings against Regan, partner David Lyons and suspended CWS employee Allan Green relating to confidential documents allegedly stolen by Green.
It is also suing Regan's banking advisor Hambros and law firm Travers Smith Braithwaite.
According to banking sources, Regan's decision to ditch his bid may have been precipitated by the threat that his financial backers were about to pull out.
Japanese bank Nomura which was financing it was understood to be very unhappy about the allegations surrounding Regan and had written to Hambros on Wednesday demanding a full explanation of them by nine o'clock Thursday morning.
But Nomura had not been satisfied by the response it had received according to the industry sources and was reviewing its position when Regan announced he was dropping his bid.
A spokesman for Nomura declined to comment. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

Britain on Friday launched a new watchdog for the country's 200,000 occupational pension schemes.
Called the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA), the body was set up in the wake of the pension scandal surrounding publishing mogul the late Robert Maxwell.
The independent watchdog, which will be based in Brighton on the English south coast and starts operations on Monday, was established under the Pensions Act 1995 drawn up in the wake of the Maxwell pensions scandal of 1991.
The new act comes into force on April 6 and the reforms are designed to reinforce the most important parts of existing British pensions law.
OPRA chief executive Caroline Johnston said it would be naive to say that one could guarantee that there could not be a recurrence of the Maxwell situation when more than 400 million pounds ($655 million) went missing, but she expressed confidence that it would be "much less likely" in the future.
OPRA will ensure that occupational schemes, which control some 500 billion pounds of assets, abide by the new rules and are adequately funded to cover members' pensions.
Its remit is to see that the interests of Britain's 12 million members of company pension schemes are protected and that occupational pension schemes comply with the law.
It will have powers to investigate suspected breaches of the law and take legal, disciplinary or regulatory action against employers or trustees where breaches are found.
Under the Pensions Act legislation, it will have the power to investigate trustees, search company offices and seize documents.
Actuaries and auditors will be under a new statutory duty to report clients if they find rules being breached.
In the event of any wrongdoing, OPRA will be able to fine trustees, remove them from their posts, disqualify them and, if necessary, replace them with their own nominees.
It can also wind up schemes and apply for injunctions to prevent the misuse of pension scheme assets.
OPRA chairman John Hayes promised the body would take a pragmatic approach and did not necessarily expect schemes to be in a position to comply with every aspect of the new Pensions Act from day one.
"We will deal with cases on merit...and be sensitive but tough," Hayes said.
And while it plans to make use of publicity to encourage compliance, OPRA says it will not be heavy handed with small-mistakes that do not involve dishonesty or a deliberate ignoring of the rules.
The new regime will rely heavily on tip-offs and has set up a hotline to enable employees and pensioners to pass on information -- anonymously if they wish.

Britain's top financial regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) on Thursday launched a 400,000 pound ($654,000) advertising campaign designed to heighten the public's awareness of the review into pensions mis-selling.
Under the banner, "Have You Lost Out On Your Pension?", the campaign seeks to underline the importance of the public playing its part in the review.
The advertisements will be carried in the national press between Thursday and Sunday this week.
The move has been timed to coincide with the mailing of questionnaires by firms to people who have potentially been mis-sold pensions.
"It is vital that investors respond to the questionnaire, even if they are unable to provide all the information asked for. Otherwise, their case cannot be resolved speedily," the SIB said in a statement.
Just two weeks ago regulators moved to speed up compensation payments to victims of pension misselling by banks and insurance companies in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Companies involved have been given an ultimatum to  settle outstanding cases in an effort to speed up the process and complete it by the end of next year.
As many as 1-1/2 million people may have been wrongly advised to take out personal pensions instead of staying in occupational schemes.
A review was launched in 1994 but recent figures show that so far only around 50,000 assessments have been completed out of the 570,000 cases currently for review.
A total 102 million pounds has been paid out in 12,650 cases where redress has been accepted, around 8,000 pounds each. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds) Thursday, 29 May 1997 14:02:56 ENDS  nFLLUIT1AF

Lloyd's of London on Thursday dismissed concerns about its exposure to possible U.S. tobacco-related insurance claims.
A spokesman for the insurance market said that the possibility of large tobacco liability claims against the industry was not regarded as a significant issue for Lloyd's.
There had been no substantial volume of tobacco manufacturers' coverage underwritten directly with the Lloyd's market, he said, and any claims applying to years prior to 1993 would be covered by the Equitas reinsurance vehicle.
Equitas was set up under last year's Lloyd's rescue plans to run-off the market's billions of pounds of pre-1993 losses.
Tobacco was one of the potential health hazards scrutinised in the course of the "exhaustive" reserving work for Equitas, and no significant exposures were identified, said Lloyd's.
"Health-related claims against tobacco companies have been covered by robustly worded policy exclusions for many years," added the spokesman.
The question of whether such clauses are sufficient to exclude cover for tobacco-related claims are at the centre of a piece of research recently produced by Schroders insurance analyst Paul Hodges.
Hodges suggests that loosely worded general liability policies may open the way for tobacco-related claims against insurers should the tide turn in legal cases currently being fought out in U.S. courts.
The tobacco industry is facing thousands of individual claims from sufferers of smoking-related diseases and on Wednesday Ohio became the twenty-fifth U.S. state to say it would be seeking to recover public money spent on treating illnesses caused by smoking.
Last month, the Louisiana attorney-general named more than one hundred insurers as co-defendants in its action against tobacco companies.
But the tobbaco industry has never had damages upheld at the end of the appeal process, in more than 500 cases filed since 1954.
For their part, tobacco manufacturers are keeping silent on the extent of any insurance cover they may have.
Asked about it at B.A.T Industries' first quarter results on Wednesday, chief executive Martin Broughton was tight lipped, saying only that the issue was complex and "certain to require litigation" to clarify it.
No tobacco company has tried to claim against its insurer in the U.S. because, argues Hodges, of the costs involved, fear of losing control of its defence, and scrutiny of possibly embarrassing internal documents under U.S. discovery laws.
But the bottom line according to one insurance market observer is that no-one knows whether insurers will be dragged into the courts or whether the exclusion clauses will stand up. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717

Lloyd's of London announced Tuesday it will give backers more time to meet planned increases in the capital they must put up to support their underwriting activities.
Lloyd's has also dropped proposals to prevent Names -- as the traditional backers of the insurance market are called -- from using their own homes as collateral for underwriting.
The planned capital increases are part of a package of measures designed to strengthen the financial security that underpins Lloyd's and to provide a level playing field between Names and corporate members.
The longer transition period for the changes announced Tuesday may go some way to meeting the concerns of Names' representatives, who had called for more time to be given to meet the new capital requirements.
Names fear they are gradually being forced out of the market in favour of corporate capital first introduced in 1994, a charge repeatedly denied by the Lloyd's hierachy.
Names are to be given three years before they have to meet the new requirements of showing evidence of assets amounting to 50 percent of the premiums they underwrite.
In a Lloyd's working party report last month, a two-year transition period was proposed but, after consultations, that has been extended from 1999 to the year 2000.
A phased increase in Names' minimum level of means to 350,000 pounds ($571,000) from the current level of 250,000 pounds ($409,000) has also been increased from two to five years and will take effect in 2002.
This 350,000 pounds ($571,000) will be made up of funds held at Lloyd's and evidence of "other personal wealth" (OPW).
Proposals to double the OPW requirements for 2000 and beyond have been dropped in favour of a slightly higher level of funds which must be held at Lloyd's.
At present, Names must put up between 20 percent and 30 percent of the total business they back, compared with 50 percent for corporate members.
By 2000, Names will have to hold 40 percent of premium capacity at Lloyd's with OPW making up a further 10 percent, bringing them into line with corporate members.
The use of "principal private residences" (PPRs) -- Names' own homes -- as collateral for members' underwriting will be allowed to continue but only for those in existence at the end of 1994.
The Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM), which represents Names' interests, broadly welcomed Tuesday's proposals, saying it was essential that all Names should demonstrate their ability to meet any losses they incurred.

British mutual insurer Norwich Union said on Thursday strong demand had led it to increase the members' offer in next week's flotation to 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion).
That means some 400 million pounds worth of shares will be clawed back from the public offering, primarily financial institutions, to satisfy members' appetite for extra shares which saw many queuing to beat the June 10 deadline.
Some 800 million pounds worth of shares had originally been set aside to meet members' applications but this proved insufficient as members' rushed to top up their holdings at a 25 pence per share discount to the public offer price.
For Norwich, the flotation will bring to an end more than 200 years as a mutual with policyholders owning the company.
Demutualisation will allow it to separate the group's life operations and thus policyholders' returns from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general insurance business.
It will also strengthen Norwich's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom.
The flotation is likely to value Norwich, which has more than seven million customers, at around 5.5 billion pounds and create Britain's third-largest quoted insurer behind Prudential Corp and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance.
Nearly three million Norwich policyholders will share 1.3 billion free shares in addition to the extra discounted shares.
Norwich still expects the offer price to range between 240 pence and 290 pence per share suggesting large profits for those lucky enough to get extra shares.
Bookmakers City Index are taking bets on a first day closing price of between 335 pence and 345 pence, an immediate profit of at least 70 pence per share.
It would put the value of the minimum 300 free shares with profits members will receive at over 1,000 pounds.
Many will receive far more depending on the value and duration of their policies.
Non-profit policyholders are to receive a flat rate 150 shares.
Institutional demand is a big factor in the likely sharp gains over the offer price.
The two building societies who floated recently -- Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leceister -- saw their share price squeezed higher by financial institutions keen to buy the shares and maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios.
Like Halifax, Norwich is almost certain to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies.
The public offer, which is made up of the institutional offer, retail offer and employees offer, will be between 1.1 and 1.2 billion pounds following the clawback of the extra shares for members.
News of the final public and members' offer price and provisional basis of allocation is expected to be made on June 15. Dealings in Norwich shares will begin on June 16. ($ = 0.612 British Pounds)

The Czech National Bank (CNB) said on Thursday that non-performing loans written off in the first 11 months of 1996 by commercial banks totalled 20 billion crowns, up from about two billion in the same period of 1995.
But CNB spokesman Martin Svehla said the main reason for the rise was a change in taxation rules allowing banks to pull more into reserves so that the credits could be written off.
"It has been allowed by the taxation rules thanks to the reserves created by these banks," Svehla told Reuters.
Most large banks have released their profit and loss figures for 1996, but have yet to detail reserves and provisions.
Svehla said the total amount of credit classified as risky in Czech commercial banks was about 220 billion crowns.
That was split between non-performing credit lingering from the Communist era, which has been consolidated in the state-run Konsolidacni Banka, and credit granted after the 1989 revolution, much of it connected with privatisations.
"We tightened up rules on how to assess risk and potential risk from credit. These rules have been effective since 1995, and they have gained more and more confidence," Svehla said.
"On one hand the figure (of classified credit) became bigger, but reserves and provisions were created, in what I would say is a sufficient amount. Speaking about the whole banking sector, all these potential losses are covered by all created reserves."
He said that six of 13 small private banks which have been offered participation in a state-supported debt relief programme were certain to enter the scheme.
Pragobanka, Banka Hana, and Moravia Banka have been accepted in the potential 13.7 billion crown debt buy-back programme, Svehla said, declining to name the others.
Banking sources have said that Forestbank, Zemska Banka, and Universal Banka had applied to join the programme and were nearing approval.
"This is good news for the banks and their clients. It means they will be better accepted on the (interbank) market," Svehla said.
Under the plan, participating banks must follow strict conditions and allow the central bank to make management changes where needed.
The state-run Konsolidacni Banka would buy the banks' doubtful assets at face value.
The banks will be required to buy back the assets after around five to seven years, again priced at their nominal value, minus credits recovered by Konsolidacni from the debtors in the meantime.
Banks seeking to participate will be held to strict requirements which include sticking to a three-year stabilisation plan and an agreement to attain an eight percent capital adequacy ratio. -- Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that the Czech National Bank may have gone too far in its attempts to slow inflation quickly and the result may have been a slowing in economic growth.
Speaking at Prague's Zofin Forum of business leaders Klaus said there was no way quickly to slow inflation, and that central bank steps last year to rein in consumer prices were more than the government wanted.
"At this moment I see in the Czech economy the existence of an array of short-term irremovable inflation factors which we cannot simply get rid of, and I also do not see any easy way to a faster slowing of inflation," said Klaus, a monetarist professor of economics.
Klaus took issue with restrictive monetary measures of the Czech National Bank last year which helped cut inflation to 7.3 percent year-on-year in February from levels above nine percent in the previous year.
He said that the government differed with the central bank on whether montening measures to slow inflation would slow the economy.
"I believe that in our context and in our structural parameters disinflation bought at the high price of a marked loss in the pace of economic growth was more than we would have wished," he added.
Still, Klaus told audience that February's inflation rate was "satisfactory".
He said that 1996 full-year gross domestic product growth ended one percent lower than the government originally expected. He did not give a specific result. The government's original forecast was growth of 4.8 percent.
Full-year official GDP results are expected later this month.
Klaus said factors in this slowing of growth were weak demand for exports because of weak growth and protected markets in western Europe. Another reason was the "unfavourable structure of our domestic demand -- consumer as well as investment."
Klaus however stressed the "restrictive measures of the central bank" and its role on demand as a factor and said the CNB "used" the chaos after inconclusive June elections to raise interest rates and tighten minimum reserve requirements.
He said the main problem facing the country's economy was a widening trade deficit, but he ruled out a devaluation of the crown to help the situation.
"I am only reminding you that the cure for our trade deficit cannot be any devaluation of the crown and fortunately the government, the central bank and the majority of analysts agree with this," Klaus said.
The Czech trade deficit, spurred by imports of raw materials and machinery needed for industrial restructuring, widened to a record 160.3 billion crowns for the whole of 1996, up from 95.7 billion the previous year.
The deficit is forecast to grow even further in 1997, to around 210-220 billion crowns.

The Anglo-Swedish consortium which makes the Gripen supersonic fighter aircraft said on Thursday that it could provide the Czech Republic with new planes for 40 percent less than any offered by its American competitors.
British Aerospace Plc and Sweden's Saab said their package offered to the Czechs, who are looking to upgrade a fleet of ageing Soviet-made aircraft, includes guaranteed financing, low-cost leasing, and possible equity participation in Czech aircraft makers.
Alan Garwood, British Aerospace's director for North America and Europe told a news conference the package would allow the Czechs to buy new Gripens for much less than any new or used aircraft offered by American makers.
"We believe the life-cycle cost of the Gripen is incredibly competitive, and the Americans cannot compete," he said, adding that there would be hidden costs inherent in the upkeep of used U.S. aircraft.
Officials declined to specify the cost-per-piece the Gripen joint venture would actually offer to the Czechs.
In cooperation with McDonnell Douglas Corp, the U.S. Navy last month offered the Czechs seven used surplus F/A-18 "Hornet" fighters in a no-cost, five-year agreement as a sweetener for a long-term deal.
The offer also includes supplying, at cost, replacement parts, pilot and ground personnel, training and equipment.
U.S. Lockheed Martin Corp has said it would have its own lower-cost offer to the Czechs for its flagship F-16.
New advanced fighters are typically $20 million and higher, depending on communications, avionics and weapons systems.
Czech defence officials have said they have the will but not the wallet to buy brand new Western-made advanced fighters, but are keeping their options open as a battle over the long-term military budget goes on.
They have said they would need about 24 fighters to replace their ageing Soviet made MiG-21s to be more compatible with NATO, but they have said new western planes are too pricey.
But Garwood said that the Gripen's basic lower price, a low-cost lease, and a guaranteed financial package backed by the Swedish and British government's with low interest rates, would ensure tremendous savings for the Czechs.
"Every day (the Czechs) delay, the American aircraft are getting older," Garwood said.
The Gripen consortium has been considering participating in a tender for a 34-percent stake in the debt-ridden Czech light jet maker Aero Vodochody a.s.. Officials said a decision would be made in the next 7-10 days on whether to enter the bidding.
Garwood said that although the Czech government did not explicitly create a direct link between equity participation in Aero and the selection of new fighter aircraft, Garwood said the government has made it clear that there would be a "strategic" link with Aero's new owners.
Gripen officials said that development of Aero's L-159 trainer aircraft would fit well with the consortium's strategy, but did not rule out remaining in the race to supply the aircraft if they decided not too seek the Aero stake.
Garwood said that the consortium was also in talks over offset agreements which would create production of some of the components domestically for Gripens provided to the Czech army.

Czechs, with a relatively large number of Oscar-winning films and filmmakers for a small nation, on Tuesday praised Jan and Zdenek Sverak for bringing home a coveted Academy Award for their film "Kolya".
The story of an ageing bachelor's re-awakening when he takes an abandoned Russian boy under his wing on the eve of Prague's bloodless 1989 Velvet Revolution won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in the ceremony held late on Monday.
President Vaclav Havel, a former dissident playwright under communism who acted in a few films himself, sent a victory telegram to the family Sverak in Los Angeles.
"I am pleased with the great success of your film. I am happy that after many years a Czech film has again received the Oscar," Havel's press office quoted the telegram as saying.
Local newscasts headlined the Kolya win for the director Jan, 31, and his scriptwriter father Zdenek, who played the greybeard bachelor in Kolya.
"The Oscar Goes to Prague" heralded the capital city's daily Vecernik Praha.
It was the first Czech foreign language film Oscar since Jiri Menzel's "Closely Observed Trains" won in 1968 amid the period known worldwide as the "Czech New Wave".
Slovak Elmar Klos won the best foreign film Oscar in 1966 for "The Shop on Main Street" when Czechoslovakia was still ruled as one state.
This country of 10 million people also lays claim to director Milos Forman, a Prague native who made the Oscar-winning "Amadeus" (1985) and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (1976) after emigrating to the United States.
Forman failed to pick up best director honours on Monday after his nomination for "The People Versus Larry Flint", after winning a Golden Globe and the Berlin's Golden Bear for the film.
The Sverak team made their first international splash in 1992, when the post-war drama-comedy "Elementary School" earned a first Oscar nomination but lost.
Zdenek is currently working on the team's first original English-language script.
Critics say Kolya, a politically-charged comedy/drama which draws heavily on the decades of animosity -- and jokes -- Czechs had for occupying Russian forces, may be one of the region's best offerings since the Czech New Wave.
"The film is about how the understanding between nations is much more important than the power," Sverak told reporters backstage after winning the Oscar.
Earlier this month Kolya won the Czech version of the Oscar, the Czech Lev (Lion), for best picture, but Zdenek Sverak was edged out for the best Czech actor award by Bolek Polivka, a popular cabaret comedian.
Kolya was favoured to take home the Oscar after winning Hollywood's Golden Globe for best foreign language film in January.

President Emil Constantinescu said on Tuesday that military modernisation costs were Romania's only obstacle to full NATO membership, but the country should still be named in the first wave of new members.
Speaking during a visit to Radio Free Europe headquarters in Prague, Constantinescu said that Romania had already met all of NATO's criteria for membership except one -- upgrading its military equipment to western standards.
"That is why we speak of Romania's nomination in the first wave followed by the effective integration when all the conditions would be fulfilled," he said.
"We still have to fulfil one of them... the capacity to support the costs of the modernisation of military equipment."
Romania -- with the backing of France, Spain and Italy -- has intensified diplomatic efforts aiming to be among the first group of ex-communist states expected to receive an invitation to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation at a July summit in Madrid.
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are widely expected to be named, but Constantinescu said Romania saw "no alternative" to its NATO integration, and should be part of the first group.
Romania is trying to link its bid to join NATO to that of Hungary. The two countries have signed an agreement to form a joint military battalion and new Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea is to make his first official trip abroad to Budapest this week. Constantinescu said Romania, after a slow start in post-Communist reforms, now met NATO's membership criteria on democracy and human rights.
"There is no argument against Romania's integration into NATO. Anything regarding democratic steps, stability, minority relations, relations with neighbouring countries and regional stability, Romania has fulfilled," Constantinescu said.
But the president said that "radical" economic reforms were still necessary, and his country could not rely on large NATO members to pay the bill for modernising Romania's army.
"It's clear that the United States... are not willing to support the costs of modernisation of military equipment for any large group of countries, because that would be impossible for the American taxpayer," he said.
The U.S. government estimated last month that the total cost to bring in former Warsaw Pact members would be between $27 billion and $35 billion up to the year 2009.
Of this, the United States is expected to bear costs of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, the Clinton administration said in a report to Congress.
The frontrunners are all struggling to find the finances for modernising their military to the alliance's standards in the midst of massive economic reforms.
Constantinescu, at the end of a two day visit to Prague, did not say how Romania might eventually meet the cost of military modernisation.
But the Bucharest government launched a programme last year to seek credits for up to $400 million to pay for military modernisation.
Romanian military planners have said the government expects to spend about three percent of gross domestic product in total military spending this year, or roughly $900 million.

When the former Czechoslovak diplomat Josef Korbel died in 1977, he may have carried the secret tragedies of his Jewish heritage to the grave, but his passion for democracy lives on through his powerful daughter.
As Madeleine Korbel Albright tours the globe and shards of her tumultuous family history surprise the world, it is her father's life and legacy which may quietly foreshadow things to come from the new U.S. Secretary of State.
Revelations this month that three grandparents died in concentration camps surprised Albright -- born in Prague in 1937 as Marie Jana Koerbelova. She fled with her family after the 1948 Communist coup, and was raised as a Catholic.
But while much of the recent focus has been on her family's Holocaust tragedies, it was her father's democratic heritage which again put the family at risk after World War Two, and apparently had the most influence on his daughter.
At her swearing-in last month, Albright first thanked her mother and father "who taught me to love freedom", then praised Vaclav Havel, the Czech dissident-turned-president, "who helped me to understand the responsibilities of freedom".
"A great deal of what I did I did because I wanted to be like my father," Albright recently told Time magazine.
As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Albright crusaded against anti-democrats, often condemning the behaviour of Cuban president Fidel Castro, Iraq's Saddam Hussein, and Serbian aggression in Bosnia.
HOW POWERFUL WILL HER FATHER'S INFLUENCE BE
Now the world wonders whether she will moderate her often sharp tongue as she tackles U.S. diplomatic problems from Havana to Beijing, or if she will lambast the leaders and political systems her father loathed.
"Cuba is an embarrassment to the Western Hemisphere and I think we need to keep making clear that there needs to be a change there," she said soon after becoming secretary of state.
Josef Korbel had a direct impact on the fragile -- and eventually crushed -- inter-war experiment of Czechoslovak democracy. Friends and former colleagues said leaving his cherished homeland behind in tatters crushed him.
"Joe was, you might say, a Czech nationalist, but more importantly he was a Czech democrat and he deeply abhorred the collapse of his country," Professor Arthur Gilbert, who taught with Korbel at the University of Denver, told Reuters.
"His anti-communism, and his distate for the Soviet Union came from a man who really had seen both systems."
Korbel was most influenced by the father of Czechoslovak democracy, President Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, a humanist philosopher whom Korbel called "the most profound writer and thinker of the late 19th and early 20th centuries".
In "Twentieth Century Czechoslovakia" published in 1977, Korbel cites Masaryk as taking the progressive step in 1918 of backing women in the national assembly, and saying that "women should devote themselves to public activity just as men."
Korbel frequently cited Masaryk in his work after becoming a professor and eventually dean of the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Denver, when he settled with his family in Colorado in 1949.
Born to a Jewish wood merchant in a northeastern Czech village in 1909, Korbel studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and then earned his law doctorate in Prague in 1933. He joined the Czechoslovak foreign service assigned as a press attache at the embassy in Belgrade.
With the Nazi onslaught imminent Korbel took his family to London as the Germans occupied the Czech lands in 1939.
Korbel's friendship with Masaryk's son Jan began during the war, when Korbel was information officer for the government in exile in London, and Jan Masaryk was foreign minister. Amid the Blitz, Madeleine learned to speak English and live under siege.
After returning from London, and serving as ambassador to Belgrade, Korbel was stunned by the 1948 Communist takeover. He wrote that the last democratic president Edvard Benes told him in vain, days before the coup that "I shall defend our democracy till my last breath."
Jan Masaryk died soon after the coup when he fell, jumped or pushed from a high foreign ministry window. His death is still controversial in Prague, but Korbel wrote in 1977 that Masaryk simply "was murdered by Soviet agents".
Masaryk's death devastated him, and his return for the funeral was the last time Korbel would see his home.
Before the Communists could get to him, Korbel spirited his family out of Czechoslovakia, taking asylum in the United States, and eventually a teaching post in Denver.
"Sooner or later he would have been imprisoned," said Antonin Sum, a former colleague of Korbel's who served in the last democratic pre-Communist foreign ministry and was imprisoned for 13 years.
"The question at that time was (Korbel) a democrat or not. He was very dangerous to the Communists." Nearly 200 of the democrats arrested were executed by the Communists.
KORBEL AN ARDENT COLD WARRIOR
Korbel quickly became a fixture at the university, leading its first doctoral programme in international relations. He is remembered by his colleagues for his visceral defence of U.S. foreign policy, even in the dark days of the Vietnam War.
"He was an ardent Cold Warrior," said Professor Gilbert whom Korbel hired in 1961. "The three things he cared about was what was happening in the Soviet Union, what was going on at school, and fly fishing."
Albright's often-quoted concept of "assertive multilateralism" in foreign policy appears to have its roots in Korbel's strong defence of U.S. involvement abroad.
But Gilbert said Korbel "was very late in the game to understand the problems about Vietnam -- well into the 60s before he started to have doubts about American involvement."
Gilbert said Korbel's house in Denver became a meeting place for informal academic policy discussions, a practice Albright carried on as a professor in Washington.
Albright married newspaper heir Joseph Albright, raised three daughters while earning her doctorate, and divorced.
But the Albright name is still seen alongside Korbel, not just as a maiden name kept as her middle name, but because father and daughter would quote each other in research.
In 1977, the father predicted Prague's "Velvet Revolution" in the final words of his last book:
"The spark is still there. One cannot doubt that it will flicker one day again into flame, and freedom will return to this land that is so essentially humane...The nation will take up again its active role in mankind's never-ending struggle for freedom and social justice."
As a professor at Georgetown, Albright advised Havel after Prague's 1989 revolution which ended four decades of Communism.

Czech Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Rudlovcak, under heavy criticism for his management of capital markets, resigned on Thursday, his ministry said.
It said Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik had accepted Rudlovcak's resignation and named Jiri Spicka, director of the ministry's section on finance and banking, as his replacement.
Rudlovcak and the ministry have been criticised by investors and in the media for their performance in regulating funds and equities markets, which are frequently accused of being opaque and rife with insider trading.
In leaving, Rudlovcak was quoted by the ministry in a statement as saying that "in the situation when there is a long-term strong media campaign against the Finance Ministry and himself especially... his continuation in the function of deputy minister would not be profitable".
It said that the situation had been problematic "especially for the activity of the (capital market) oversight, in which (Rudlovcak's) authority is continually eroded through the systematic attacks."
Criticism of Rudlovcak intensified in recent weeks after several cases where Czech investment fund managers and major shareholders were found to have been stripping assets of the funds under the noses of regulators.
One case involved the investment fund Trend, in which a group of shareholders was arrested and charged with transferring major holdings out of the fund, including a major stake in the Prague department store Kotva a.s.
The arrests too place long after shares had been transferred and a group of minority shareholders is still fighting to get them back.
On Thursday, a representative of the Czech Value Fund, one of Trend's large minority shareholders which has put much of the blame for ignorance of the fund's stripped assets on the Finance Ministry, welcomed Rudlovcak's resignation.
"It's a positive sign of course. It shows that what we are working on here is having some effect," said John Moffitt of the Czech Value Fund, who leads a group of investors pushing for tighter regulation of the capital markets.
Another case involved the fund CS Fond in which managers were found to have drained more than a billion crowns ($34 million) of assets into personal accounts.
The ministry statement cited the CS Fond case specifically, saying that Rudlovcak and his staff did what it could within the framework of the law but it was up to other criminal justice bodies to resolve the case which had "an unambiguous criminal character".
Much of the frustration on Prague's share markets, which have consistently underperformed other post-communist markets in the region, has been aimed at the Finance Ministry.
Prague Stock Exchange Chairman Tomas Jezek, one of the most outspoken critics of Rudlovcak, is pushing for legislation to give power to a new independent watchdog fashioned on the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Jezek was not immediately available for comment after the ministry's announcement.
Jan Sykora, a broker at the Prague investment house Wood &amp; Co, commented : "I think it's good news, because clearly there are a lot of things not going well in the capital markets and Rudlovcak was responsible for that (the capital markets)."

Volkswagen AG's Czech unit Skoda Automobilova a.s. said on Thursday that it should nearly double its worldwide production capacity, making half a million cars yearly by the end of the century.
At a news conference detailing last year's results -- which showed a swing to a small profit after a 1995 loss -- Chief Financial Officer Volkhard Kohler said the former communist car maker had laid the foundation for strong global expansion.
"The half million (cars produced yearly) volume is no Utopia for us, we are sure we can achieve that," he said.
"We have to globalise," said Kohler, who is to be re-assigned soon after helping lead Skoda's transformation.
Skoda posted 1996 net profit of 163 million crowns after a loss of 1.62 billion crowns in 1995, when it ploughed much of its cash flow into building a new mid-sized platform for its Octavia line which premiered last autumn.
"In the next and future years we don't count on any losses, only profits," said Kohler, declining a more specific forecast.
Skoda's total turnover comprised roughly 3.4 percent of Volkswagen Group's worldwide take in 1996. VW built up a 70 percent stake in the Czech company in 1995 since joining in on its privatisation earlier in the decade.
Officials said potential domestic production capacity would be filled when it reaches an expected 340,000 cars this year.
Expansion is to come from opening new production elsewhere, such as its assembly line in Poznan, Poland -- which has a capacity for 15,000 to 20,000 cars.
Total sales rose 34 percent last year to 58.9 billion crowns, while unit sales were up 24 percent to 279,363 cars, almost entirely comprised of Skoda's compact Felicia line.
Production is forecast to increase 30 percent this year, as the Octavia range comes fully on stream.
The century-old Skoda, based north of Prague, posted robust sales growth of 47 percent in developed countries of western Europe, which accounted for nearly a third of total turnover.
Meanwhile, sales to central and eastern Europe, excluding Skoda's home market, rose 78 percent, and domestic turnover was up 24 percent and comprised 45 percent of sales.
Sales and marketing director Detlef Wittig said that the company hoped to hold on to its 50 percent domestic market share while continuing to focus on Poland and Russia for growth and making gains in new western European markets.
"In highly developed Western markets we have broken through with the Felicia range," Wittig said, stressing that Skoda's marketing had concentrated on the new quality of the brand which was once the butt of many western jokes.
Unit sales in two of its largest western European export markets Germany and Britain showed growth of just two percent, but sales to France, Italy, and Denmark showed double-digit growth, and sales to nearby Austria doubled to 9,457 units.
Meanwhile it had a lower turnover in Asia and South America of 10 percent as it directed exports toward stronger demand in Europe. The company has yet to attack North America.
Despite average double-digit wage increases and Czech average annual inflation last year of 8.8 percent, personnel costs grew only 6.8 percent, as the workforce grew 6.9 percent to 17,992 employees.
Skoda exports account for roughly five percent of total Czech exports. Kohler said that further increases in productivity and efficiency would counter the strong Czech crown and increase Skoda's share to seven or eight percent.
"We can say that the ground floor (at Skoda) has already been finished, but it now depends on our colleagues to make a nice skyscraper," the outgoing Kohler said.

The Czech National Bank (CNB) said on Wednesday that it was not satisfied with the continued firming of the Czech crown, and cautioned that it has the option of intervening on the market when necessary.
"Intervention (on the market) is our normal instrument, and we can use it whenever we are not satisfied (with the crown's exchange rate)," CNB spokesman Martin Svehla told Reuters.
The crown was still well above its mark/dollar basket on Wednesday, as the CNB matched the market, fixing it at 27.947/dollar 16.664/mark, or 5.42 percent over parity with the basket, and just below Tuesday's record fixing at +5.51.
"The other question is whether we are satisfied? You heard (CNB) governor (Josef Tosovsky) saying there is 'no reason' for the crown to be like this," Svehla added.
"It signals that the central bank is not fully satisfied with this development." He declined to elaborate, and said these were just "general" comments.
The crown's surge has been fuelled by more than 30 billion crowns in recent issues of mostly medium-term Eurobonds.
Tosovsky said at the peak of the wave in late January that there was "no rational" macroeconomic reason for the crown's rise, and the Eurobond wave.
The firming currency is compounding a troublesome trade deficit which grew to a record 160 billion crowns in 1996.
Some crown dealers have said the central bank that had been putting out feelers in the market recently, but others said that it did not appear that intervention was imminent.
"I don't expect any direct intervention soon," said Citibank dealer Emil Stava. "I don't think their main goal is to help exporters by a depreciation of the currency."
He said the CNB was still mainly concerned with controlling the money supply and inflation.
The market has not bought the CNB's comments, as dealers keep buying crowns.
Crown Eurobonds keep coming -- another billion crowns was issued on Wednesday -- taking advantage of interest rate spreads against major currencies and an inverted yield curve.
The CNB has not intervened since last February when it propped up the crown after widening the fixing corridor to plus/minus 7.5 percent against the basket from 0.5 percent.
Svehla repeated that the CNB had no immediate plans to lower its key interest rates, despite a rapid decline in the money supply in recent months.
The CNB's repo rate remains solidly at 12.4 percent, while its discount rate has been at 10.5 percent since it was raised a full percentage point last June.
Meanwhile inflation in January slowed to 7.4 percent, year-on-year, from 8.6 percent in December.

The Czech National Bank (CNB) on Tuesday put the largest fully-private bank, Agrobanka a.s., under forced administration due to liquidity problems arising from the failure of another bank, Kreditni Banka a.s..
The central bank, in its 12th intervention into a commercial bank in the post-Communist period, said it would guarantee all of Agrobanka's obligations during a "temporary" forced administration period of an unspecified duration.
Analysts said the move was another badly-needed step in reforming the banking sector and should speed up overall market reforms.
CNB Governor Josef Tosovsky on Tuesday said that the central bank instructed the "big banks" to prepare up to six billion crowns ($159 million) to help liqidity at Agrobanka, which has four billion crowns in basic capital.
Tosovsky did not elaborate on what form the liquidity help might take or from which source.
The "Big Four" banks are Ceska Sporitelna, Komercni Banka, Investicni a Postovni Banka and Ceskoslovensko Obchodni Banka a.s. (CSOB) -- all in which the state holds a significant stake. All but CSOB, have privately-held shares.
Tosovsky, who called Agrobanka's situation a problem with "liquidity not solvency" said the central bank would jump in with its own funds if necessary to help the central bank's "precautionary measures".
In a statement issued after an overnight meeting of the Czech cabinet, the CNB said that problems of Agrobanka, the country's fifth largest overall, had arisen as a consequence of the failure of the medium-sized Kreditni Banka a.s.
It also said the move stemmed from the investigation of people in the Kreditni case -- in which five people connected to Kreditni have been indicted on fraud charges -- who are also connected to Agrobanka.
"The investigation of the fall of Kreditni Banka...and its politicisation, and charges against people connected to Agrobanka, negatively influences the liquidity position of this bank (Agrobanka)," the CNB said in its statement.
Over 70 percent of banking activity in the country is done within the four largest banks.
In order to support Agrobanka, the CNB said it would guarantee all deposits at the bank, and that it would ensure, in cooperation with other commercial banks, sufficient "financial sources" for Agrobanka, should it need them.
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the central bank's move was a preventative step aimed at keeping the banking sector sound. "There isn't even the slightest reason for any sort of banking panic," Klaus told journalists on Tuesday.

A four-year saga over Hong Kong's Container Terminal Number Nine (CT9) project was finally resolved on Thursday with a berth swapping plan and removal a key consortium, government officials said at a news conference.
Under the terms of the deal, which received Beijing's blessing on Thursday, British-controlled Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd no longer leads the consortium, which has been renamed Asia Container Terminals Ltd (ACT).
ACT, formerly the Tsingyi Consortium, would swap the two berths in CT9 originally awarded for two existing berths in the existing Container Terminal Eight (CT8) currently operated by Modern Terminals Ltd (MTL), a unit of Wharf (Holdings) Ltd
The Sea-Land Group would take over from Jardine as leader of the consortium, said an ACT spokesman also present at the news conference.
MTL would build three of the four berths at CT9, while Hong Kong International Terminals Ltd (HIT), a a unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, would build one berth.
Both HIT and MTL would also have one smaller feeder berth each at CT9, officials said.
The contract to develop CT9, which will have an annual capacity of 2.2 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) upon completion, was awarded by the Hong Kong government in 1992 to the consortium by private treaty grant.
Tsingyi was originally allocated two berths. Existing container terminal operators, HIT and MTL, were awarded development rights to one berth each.
Beijing, citing the lack of an open tender, had refused to approve the project as required because it straddles Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China.
Beijing had accused the Hong Kong government of rewarding Jardine, a pillar of the British establishment since the colony was founded, for supporting Governor Chris Patten's electoral reforms, themselves the object of bitter Chinese opposition.
Government officials and the terminal operators declined to comment on the political aspects of the case.
"This is purely a commercial decision, it is not political ...no one can force any agreement upon the commercial partners," said Stephen Ip, the Hong Kong government's Secretary for Economic Services.
ACT representatives said the consortium had not discussed the changes with China.
"We had no discussion with the PRC (People's Republic of China) and we've had no political pressure from the PRC," ACT spokesman Ed Aldridge said.
ACT is 29.5 percent owned by Sea-Land. Jardine group companies, Jardine Pacific and the Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd jointly hold 28.5 percent.
Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd holds 28.5 percent and New World Infrastructure Ltd 13.5 percent.
Officials declined to disclose cost estimates for the project, adding that all other details had yet to be worked out. -- HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 28436441

Investors swept up in the current wave of "red chip" fever for China-related stocks are at risk of losses because of the poor health of many mainland state-owned companies, a senior economist warned on Friday.
Demand for the Hong Kong-listed companies with mainland ties has accompanied record highs in the Hang Seng index, in a burst of optimism about Hong Kong's handover to China in three weeks.
But Kenneth Courtis, strategist and chief economist at Deutsche Bank Group Asia Pacific, warned that the speculative gains could be short-lived in light of serious problems with mainland Chinese companies.
A growing number of Chinese and China-backed companies have listed in Hong Kong, and the lure of China's huge domestic market and economic potential have proved difficult for foreign investors to resist.
In Hong Kong, punters -- from serious investors to the unsophisticated -- have formed long queues to get their hands on subscription forms to buy new shares, sometimes paying for them, in the hope of making fortunes.
"People who are rushing into the streets to try to pay their $100 to get a subscription form may think they'll be able to sell that some time soon," said Courtis.
"Things like that usually end in tears and it won't be any different this time," he told the Foreign Correspondents Club.
But Courtis said caution would be a better bet as many mainland state-owned companies were losing money and Beijing itself was in a race against time to restructure them.
Chinese state-owned enterprises, which have lived under the shelter of communist rule, remain deeply inefficient and Beijing is encouraging many of them to merge into huge conglomerates in the hope that the stronger firms may help ailing ones.
"We are now in a situation when losses (made) by state companies are so big that they've come to destabilise the financial system," Courtis said.
He said that the problems of these companies are a factor in China's difficult campaign to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which promotes free trade and reliance on market forces.
"One of the reasons it is so difficult to negotiate WTO membership for China is that (most) state companies wouldn't survive under WTO rules."
Courtis said he did not think China would enter the WTO for four to five years but was confident the United States will continue Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status for China for another year.
"It will go through this year. The President might have to use his veto to overscome the resistance...but the debate will be bitter," he told reporters after his speech to the club.
President Bill Clinton announced in May his decision to renew China's MFN status but many members of Congress have said they will vote against it, angered by China's policies on trade, human and religious rights.

Future Hong Kong lawmakers, poised for a bitter legal clash with the pro-democracy camp, passed a string of laws on Saturday to come into effect after the territory reverts to China on July 1.
Meeting just across the border in China's Shenzhen city, the 60-member provisional legislature was presented with a series of bills by officials of the future administration led by Hong Kong's chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa.
The most crucial was a bill to govern residency rights in Hong Kong after Britain hands its colony of over 150 years back to China at midnight on June 30.
The bill, which passed through two readings on Saturday, is expected to pass a third before June 30 and be "rectified", or officially made into law on July 1.
The meeting came as Hong Kong's Democratic Party warned it will slap a lawsuit within the next few days on the China-backed provisional chamber, which Beijing has vowed to put in place of the current elected legislative council on July 1.
The party, which has 19 seats in the current chamber, claims the provisional legislature is unconstitutional and that it is illegal for two legislatures to operate at the same time.
Hong Kong's Supreme Court facilitated the imminent legal battle when it allowed the Democrats on Thursday to use government funds to fight laws passed by the shadow chamber.
But the looming legal clash threatens to involve more than just Hong Kong's incoming and outgoing lawmaking chambers.
A Beijing mouthpiece accused the British-led administration in Hong Kong of supporting the democrats -- against China.
"The British have once again threatened the smooth transition of sovereignty by allowing legal aid to challenge the laws passed by the provisional legislature," the Beijing-funded Wen Wei Po said in an editorial on Saturday.
Members of the provisional legislature who, like future leader Tung, were carefully selected into office under Beijing's auspices in December, scoffed at the looming lawsuit and claimed the future lawmaking chamber had strong legal basis.
"I'm only sad that Hong Kong must spend so much money over something when the outcome, everyone knows, is a foregone conclusion," said provisional legislator Tam Yiu-chung.
But there was an upbeat note as Hong Kong moves ever closer to the Chinese fold.
A survey conducted by Hong Kong's Home Affairs Branch found 78 percent of Hong Kong people were satisfied with the current situation in the territory, up from 76 percent in a March poll. The survey, done in mid-May, polled a total of 1,503 people.
But confidence levels dipped slightly. Some 72 percent said they expected Hong Kong to remain prosperous and stable, down from 73 percent in March. Twenty percent expected the situation to improve in the next 12 months, down from 24 percent in March.
On the economic front, China made further inroads into Hong Kong's strategic infrastructure industry with the purchase of a stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd.
In an announcement late on Friday, Cable &amp; Wireless Plc, parent of HongKong Telecoms, said it sold a 5.5 percent stake to state-owned China Telecom for US$1.185 billion.

Hong Kong property prices have tumbled 10 percent from recent peaks and are poised to fall further as speculators turn nervous following recent steps by the government to cool the market, analysts said on Wednesday.
Transactions have also dipped and some buyers have reneged on contracts, preferring to forego deposits rather than face further possible price falls, real estate brokers said.
"Sentiment on the property market has turned bearish," said Raymond Ngai, property analyst with UBS Securities.
"There will be a consolidation and property prices will fall by up to 20 percent by the end of this quarter," he said.
Property brokers said prices have already fallen five to 10 percent from recent peaks.
The bearish sentiment comes after the government, under intense pressure to cool sharply rising prices, in late March took steps to speed the flow of new flats into the market.
Flats can now be presold 15 months before completion, up from 12 months, and developers must offer them no more than six months after receiving government approval for presales in batches no smaller than 20 percent of the total available.
Compounded by a 25 basis point rise in prime lending rates to 8.75 percent, the bubble enveloping Hong Kong's property market has sprung a leak, analysts said.
Prices have dipped by at least five percent in the last week compared to better weeks seen in late 1996 and early 1997, while the number of transactions in popular private estates in Hong Kong have dipped five percent, real estate brokers said.
In some flashy locations like the Midlevels on Hong Kong island, some buyers or speculators have even reneged on deals, preferring to forego their deposits as they feared taking up mortgages in the face of falling prices, brokers said.
"Some people have reneged on deals, as many as two out of 10 units, especially in the pricier districts," said one property consultant who declined to be named.
"It's now a buyer's market, buyers call the shots," said May Toh, a broker with Glory Property Company.
Secretary for Housing Dominic Wong said confirmers, traders buy a property and then resell it before assignment procedures are completed whose activities give a broad indication of speculation, were cutting prices to move their holdings.
Some analysts described the thaw in prices as healthy because the sharp ascent in the last year was unsustainable.
The government curbs and the interest rate hike were merely catalysts for a correction that was long overdue, they said.
"Over the last six months, property prices have gone up very sharply, by 30 percent, so it is a healthy development now, with the market consolidating," Ngai said.
"The curbs, interest rate increase were just catalysts for the downturn in sentiment, the main reason is because prices went up too fast," Ngai said.
Tycoon Lee Shau-kee, chairman of Henderson Land Development Co Ltd, told Reuters on Wednesday residential property prices should stabilise after falling five to 10 percent.
"Property prices in the secondary market have fallen five to 10 percent in April from (levels) in early March and turnover has been reduced significantly," Lee said. "The prices should stabilise after the recent adjustment."
Housing in Hong Kong is notoriously expensive and many of its 6.4 million population fear being unable to buy homes.
Irked by sharply rising prices since mid 1996, anonymous residents have planted a fake bomb and threatened to poison top government officials who they accuse of ignoring the problem.

Sing Tao Holdings Ltd, facing a probe by graft-busters at its Hongkong Standard Newspapers Ltd unit, could see a drop in advertising revenues at its English-language papers, media analysts said on Thursday.
"Advertising will be affected, of course. People look at the circulation when they decide to place ads," said Ben Kwong, research director at Dharmala Securities.
Hongkong Standard Newspapers, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sing Tao, publishes the English-language Hongkong Standard and Sunday Standard newspapers.
"Advertisers will probably withhold or be hesitant until they have clarification from the company as to what exactly their circulation was," another analyst said.
Hong Kong's graft watchdog, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), said it raided the Hongkong Standard offices on Wednesday as part of an investigation into fraudulent inflation of circulation figures.
The ICAC also arrested four current employees and two former staff members.
The ICAC said its investigations had "revealed a scheme which involved the deliberate excess printing of over 10,000 extra copies of the newspapers each day which were purportedly sold to a bogus bulk distributor".
The surplus was actually sold as waste paper, it said in a statement on Wednesday.
"ICAC inquiries also indicated that more recently the deliberately printed surplus and systematic disposal has ranged from 14,000 up to 23,000 copies per day," it said.
A Sing Tao official told Reuters the company would not make any comment while the investigations were continuing.
Trading in Sing Tao shares resumed on Thursday after a one-day suspension. The shares closed HK$0.075 lower at HK$2.90.
Analysts said that while Sing Tao shares would come under some pressure due to the probe at its Hongkong Standard Newspapers unit, the publishing group was not expected to suffer deep cuts to its bottom line as the English-language papers had not brought in much profit in past years.
On Thursday, Sing Tao published an announcement reprinting the ICAC statement and gave results for the group.
"The results of Hongkong Standard for the year ended 31 March, 1996, showed an operating loss in excess of the operating loss of approximately HK$11.7 million (US$1.51 million) incurred by the group in newspaper publishing in that year," the announcement said.
It gave no breakdown of the losses.
"The impact on Sing Tao shares won't be great. Investors anyway don't weight newspaper stocks highly because of their difficult market conditions and keen competition," said Kwong.
Some analysts said Hong Kong's other English-language daily, the South China Morning Post -- published by South China Morning Post (Holdings) Ltd -- would emerge the clear winner.
"If anybody had wanted to save a little bit before by going on a cheaper advertising rate in the Standard, they will now say 'Why take the risk?'" one analyst said.
The ICAC probe is not the first time the Sing Tao group has made news in Hong Kong.
In May, rumours swept the stock market that chairman Sally Aw was in talks to sell all or part of her 68 percent holding in the group to a Malaysian party. Aw denied the rumours.
The group shut its Chinese-language Sing Tao Evening Post newspaper in December, citing sluggish circulation and advertising revenue.

Hong Kong yachtsmen bent with the wind on Thursday, voting overwhelmingly to adopt a Chinese name, two weeks before the territory's return to Chinese rule on July 1.
While keeping the name "Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club" in English, members of the elite colonial sporting club voted in a show of hands to adopt a Chinese name, which when translated would simply mean "Hong Kong Yacht Club".
At an extraordinary general meeting called to decide on the Chinese name, club commodore David Kong admitted to more than 200 members that the Chinese name was a compromise.
The club, which to this day has fewer ethnic Chinese members than Westerners, was deeply divided last year when its mostly British members fought hard to keep the "Royal" tag on the English name.
Chinese members lobbied hard but failed twice to remove the "Royal" tag, a symbol of British colonialism that they felt would be inappropriate after Hong Kong reverts to China.
"The proposal we have in front of us is a compromise. We are being courteous and considerate to the incoming government and courteous and considerate to our members," Kong told members.
Still, about seven members at the meeting voted nay.
"What is this? One club, two names?" one member joked aloud, drawing uproarious laughter and applause from the rest.
Hong Kong, a British colony for 156 years, will revert to China from July 1 under a "one country, two systems" formula, espoused by China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
"I don't see why we should be inconsistent. If we are "Royal" in English, we should be "huang jia" in Chinese," a Caucasian member said at the meeting. "Huang jia" is "Royal" in Mandarin, China's official language.
Choi Chung-yung, a member since 1984, said it was important not to have "huang jia" in the Chinese name.
"If we are known as "Royal" after the handover, we may be disadvantaged if ever we need help from Chinese authorities because we will be seen as British," Choi said.
"Anyway, since the day I joined, I've never seen the "Royal" as meaningful or prestigious, unlike the British," he said.
Long before July 1, other elite clubs in Hong Kong have dropped their "Royal" tags and are now known simply as the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Hong Kong Golf Club.
The queen's portrait has also been knocked off stamps and coins in favour of the territory's harbour skyline.

In a move certain to anger Beijing, publisher Penguin group and Chinese activists on Friday launched a compilation of letters and essays written in prison by prominent Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng.
China's Foreign Ministry has already denounced publication of the book "The Courage To Stand Alone", which contains excerpts of hundreds of letters Wei wrote to his siblings, prison authorities and top members of China's Communist Party.
The eloquent and fearless letters were written during his 14-year (1979 to 1993) imprisonment, most of the time while in solitary confinement in a tiny cell.
Wei, 47, is China's best known dissident and regarded as the father of China's democracy movement.
He was jailed in 1979 for counter-revolutionary incitement after advocating democratic change when he referred to democracy as China's much needed "fifth modernisation".
Wei managed to obtain his letters, many of which were never mailed but kept in his prison dossier, just before he was released from jail in September 1993.
After six months of freedom, Wei was detained again in 1994 and later sentenced to a further 14 years for treason.
At a news conference on Friday, Chinese pro-democracy activists called for the immediate release of Wei, who has been denied medical attention for his deteriorating health.
"I am asking all of you, the people of Hong Kong and all freedom loving people of the world, to join me in demanding Wei Jingsheng's immediate and unconditional release," said Xiao Qiang, executive director of lobby group Human Rights in China.
"Democracy and human rights are not luxuries for Chinese people, they are necessities," Xiao said.
Wei, now in a jail in Hebei province, has arthritis, high blood pressure and stomach problems, and his spirit is now flagging, according to members of his family who are allowed to visit him once a month, said Robin Munro of Human Rights Watch/Asia.
"From accounts of his family, he has become very despondent. We have to be worried about his survival this time," said Munro.
Also present at the news conference was dissident Liu Qing, and close friend of Wei, who was jailed for 10 years for publishing the transcript of Wei's 1979 trial.
Liu told reporters he was worried about the future of political and human rights in Hong Kong after midnight June 30, when the territory of 6.4 million people reverts to Chinese rule after 156 years as a British colony.
Under Sino-British treaties on Hong Kong's handover, the territory is promised a high degree of self rule under a "one country, two systems" formula that was espoused by the late Deng.
"For the long term, I cannot believe in China's dictatorship. In the last few decades, this government has never kept to its words. It has always gone back on its words, its policy on Tibet and many other policies," Liu said.
"I cannot say that Hong Kong will be an exception to this record," said Liu, the chairman of Human Rights in China.

As speculation mounted in Hong Kong about a possible link between Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd and a Chinese partner, the Hong Kong utility chose to keep mum on Thursday about its future shareholding structure.
"Today is not the time, the place to say specifically what will be done," deputy chairman Richard Brown told a news conference. "There are rumours covered in the press and we don't comment on them".
In the run-up to July 1, when the British colony of Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule, markets have been awash with rumours of state Chinese enterprises preparing to buy their way into the Hong Kong telecommunications giant.
Hongkong Telecom is 58.5 percent-owned by Cable &amp; Wireless Plc but analysts said both companies may see the wisdom in taking on a mainland partner because of the handover.
However top officials at the Hongkong Telecom news conference, where the company reported a 12.5 percent rise in net profit for the year to March 31 to HK$11.18 ($1.44) billion, declined to answer reporters' questions on the issue.
China's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) and China United Telecommunications Corp (China Unicom) have been consistently pinpointed by the local press as likely partners.
A China Unicom official told reporters on Wednesday the company was interested in buying a stake in Hongkong Telecom.
China Unicom is a joint venture of 16 major Chinese organisations, led by the ministries of power, railways and electronics industry.
Brown told reporters there were scores of companies which were interested in partnering Hongkong Telecom, but the company would only reveal details when something was firm.
A seasoned China observer said it was a foregone conclusion that Hongkong Telecom, like all other crucial infrastructure giants in the territory, will see an injection of Chinese interest, whichever state enterprise that came from.
"It's a positive and logical step. It opens scope for more cooperation with the mainland. Big state enterprises will want some kind of say in Hong Kong, after all these years," the observer said.
Powerful Chinese enterprises like CITIC Pacific have claimed large chunks of the territory's air carrier Cathay Pacific Ltd and utility China Light and Power, while China National Aviation Corp bought nearly 36 percent of Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd last year.
An analyst with a foreign research firm, who declined to be named, said some investors viewed positively talk of a Unicom stake in Hong Kong Telecom. But he noted that Unicom had problems of its own.
"It is struggling with MPT and has so far nothing much apart from a mobile business in China," he said.
"Unicom has a host of shareholders from many different ministries and this could be a negative thing because all of them have different, conflicting views."
Shares in Hong Kong Telecom rose to their highest level in almost a year on Thursday, gaining HK$0.80 to close at HK$15.00.

Future Hong Kong lawmakers on Saturday agreed on a formula to pass laws for the territory in face of mounting anger over Beijing's plans to roll back civil liberties after taking back sovereignty from Britain.
The provisional legislature met in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, to decide the format which will enable it to pass bills, including those to dilute existing Hong Kong laws protecting civil rights.
The China-crafted interim chamber, which Beijing intends to put in place of the present elected legislature at the handover, agreed all three required readings of proposed bills could take place before July 1.
The bills would then be confirmed and made into laws on July 1, the local cable television station reported. Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to China at midnight on June 30.
The move followed a heated debate this week after the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, launched plans to curb protests and foreign funding of Hong Kong political groups after the handover.
"Some members feel that since we have been empowered to scrutinise and to pass laws before July 1, then that power should be used before July 1," provisional legislator Selina Chow said.
"(It will) enable some absolutely essential legislation to enjoy the certainty of having been passed before July 1 so as to avoid a legal vacuum."
Pro-democracy activists have threatened to sue the 60-strong provisional chamber if it passes any laws, holds meetings or opens offices on Hong Kong soil before July 1.
Hong Kong democrats regard the interim legislature as a breach of the territory's post-handover constitution. Earlier, they launched a protest banner attached to dozens of colourful helium-filled balloons.
"Against the provisional legislature passing laws before July 1," the banner read. The protesters cheered as it floated towards China.
Tung's proposals on civil liberties were widely expected after Beijing resolved in February to repeal or amend existing Hong Kong laws protecting freedoms and political rights. But the plan has sparked a fiery debate locally and drawn criticism from the United States.
Hong Kong people will need police permission to demonstrate after July 1, a far cry from the current practice of merely notifying police beforehand.
With the lawmaking formula in place, the provisional chamber is now in a position to enact Tung's plans into law. Hong Kong's 6.4 million people have been given three weeks to comment on the proposals.
The rights issue looked sure to remain in the international spotlight after U.S. officials said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would hold talks on Monday with the leader of Hong Kong's democracy movement Martin Lee, now on a lobbying and fund-raising mission in the United States.
But there is little to suggest that China will yield to pressure over its plans.
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday praised the provisional legislature and its work, a local newspaper said.
In a Beijing meeting with Rita Fan, president of the provisional chamber, Qian was quoted by Fan as saying he was very satisfied with the interim chamber and would give his full support.

Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa will unveil on Thursday revised plans to curb civil liberties and rights in the territory after it reverts to China at midnight on June 30, a spokesman from Tung's office said on Wednesday.
The original proposals, announced in early April, restrict demonstrations and ban overseas funding of political parties. They have been revised after Tung launched a three-week consultation exercise seeking views from the public.
"The proposals have been revised after the consultation, considering what people said," the spokesman told Reuters.
"We will have a compendium of the thousands of submissions...what sort of responses there were," he said.
The revised plans will be announced on Thursday by Michael Suen, a top civil servant recently seconded to Tung's office, and are expected to be made into post-handover Hong Kong laws by the China-backed provisional legislature.
The interim chamber, under China's plans, will itself replace Hong Kong's current elected legislature on July 1.
Tung's plans had long been expected after China's parliament, the National People's Congress, endorsed in February a proposal to change or drop some laws protecting civil rights in Hong Kong.
Tung, the territory's chief executive-designate, argues the intended changes are mere technicalities, needed to strike a balance between freedoms and social order.
But they have drawn a groundswell of opposition from Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp as well as strong criticism from Britain, the United States and human rights groups.
Tung's revised plans were preceded on Wednesday by a fierce debate in Hong Kong's legislative council, with prominent lawmakers condemning the controversial plans.
Independent legislator Christine Loh said Tung had given no basis for his intended changes to current laws that have worked well for Hong Kong.
"The proposals are an invitation to political self-censorship and predictably have a serious, heinous effect on participation in public affairs and an assault on the international character and public spirit of Hong Kong civil society," she said.
But a motion, put forward by Democratic Party legislator Cheung Man-kwong, expressing deep regret over the proposals, was rejected by a vote of 27 against 23.
Legislator Ngai Shiu-kit and a member of the pro-business Labour Party argued the proposed changes were necessary.
"Some people have behaved themselves in such a manner in public that have given rise to some alarm," he said, referring to a protest last year when a group of Hong Kong activists stormed into the Japanese consulate in a row over disputed islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan.
"If a society is manipulated by such people, then Hong Kong will be embarking on a very dangerous path and that would not be in the overall interest of the community," he said.

Weeping crowds mourning the death of Deng Xiaoping swamped the hamlet where China's political patriarch was born, prompting authorities to send armed police to keep order, officials said on Friday.
Thousands of mourners flocked to Paifang village in Guang'an county in the southwestern province of Sichuan, some falling to their knees and weeping, said an official at Deng's former residence, now a museum.
"There are a lot of people crying, some of them young, but most of them are older," the official said by telephone.
"Some old people have knelt on the ground and wept. Their faces were covered in tears," he said.
Deng, architect of market-oriented reforms that transformed China into a rising superpower, passed away on Wednesday night aged 92.
Officials at Deng's old courtyard abode, which normally saw some 100 visitors a day, were unable to handle the flood of people that broke over the hamlet after Deng's death was announced early on Thursday.
"About 3,000 people came here yesterday," the official said. "Today there will be more."
"It's extremely crowded in here," he said. "Anywhere there is room to stand is crowded with people."
Officials sent the paramilitary People's Armed Police to maintain order at the museum, which had been converted into a makeshift shrine to Deng, he said.
"Although there are a lot of people, everything is orderly," the official said, adding that no incidents had been reported.
A large photograph of Deng hung over the courtyard entrance, crowned by a black banner with white characters reading "Mourn Deng Xiaoping With Sorrow", he said.
"One young fellow cried and said 'Without Deng there would not be the happy life of today'," the official said.
Mourners, many wearing black armbands and holding white, handmade paper flowers, filed past the photograph, bowing or kneeling in front of a table heaped with cypress branches symbolising uprightness and longevity.
Some of those paying their last respects to Deng had come from distant Guangzhou and Shenzhen in the southern province of Guangdong, a booming region that owed its prosperity to his ambitious capitalistic reforms, another museum official said.
"Taxis, shops, hotels...and those who have come to Guang'an for business or as tourists are displaying white flowers to show their grief over Deng Xiaoping," the China News Service said.
The outpouring of sadness and reflection in Paifang contrasted with the bustling streets of Beijing, where flags flying at half-mast on the second day of official mourning were the only sign of a break from routine.
The Supreme People's Court, China's top judicial body, ordered all courts to ensure strict law enforcement and to safeguard social stability, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Political transitions in communist China in the past have been fraught with difficulty and the deaths of some previous senior leaders have triggered mass protests.

U.S. and Chinese negotiators were locked in last-ditch talks on Saturday to try to hammer out a new textile accord and a deal on market access after extending by a day a deadline for a cross-Pacific trade war.
Chief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said she was confident of an agreement on Saturday in a fifth day of talks with officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
"We felt like we had made tremendous progress and we are looking to complete negotiations today," she told Reuters before leaving for the ministry. "You're always positive you can reach an agreement but you have to balance it out."
Hayes and Chinese officials wrangled late into Friday night to try to iron out problems in renewing a 1994 textile accord and resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports.
The United States had extended by a day the deadline for agreement on a new textile accord with China, Hayes said.
"I felt like it was important to extend it, the deadline, for one day... so we could get a fresh start this morning," Hayes said before resuming the eleventh-hour talks.
"We did not complete the agreement... so we felt like we'd have one extra day to complete it," she said. "We didn't finish last night so we are re-evaluating where we are and will continue negotiations this morning."
U.S. officials said they hoped for a deal by the end of Saturday.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Hayes said the U.S. side was still focusing on two major demands -- its market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.
"The two main things that we have been consistently concerned about are the market access that China has to the United States... and also making sure that it is balanced, that we have a market access package from China," she said.
Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier.
However, they said hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement.
"I expect the reason for the talks not wrapping up is market access," said National Retail Federation vice-president Robert P. Hall said on Friday. "This is an issue that is not traditionally part of apparel bilaterals."
Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the previous deadline of January 31, Hayes has said.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries.

A powerful earthquake struck northwest China on Saturday, killing at least two people and injuring three in an area where about 50 people died in a tremor in January, officials said.
The earthquake measuring 6.0 on the open-ended Richter scale jolted Jiashi county in the northwestern region of Xinjiang at 2.04 p.m. (0604 GMT), an official with the local office of the State Seismological Bureau said.
"It is now known that two people have died and two have been seriously injured," the official said. A seismological official in the regional capital of Urumqi said a total of three people had been injured.
The tremor badly frightened the district's residents, many of whom are sheep herders or cotton farmers, and sent people spilling out into the streets, said one official with a local television station.
"It was really strong. Our building and everything in it was rattling, the building shook really fiercely," the television official said.
"Everyone ran out of their houses in terror, but most went back inside when it stopped shaking," she said, adding that many buildings around her office building had cracked, though none had collapsed.
Many of the area's residents lived in earthen houses that are easily damaged by earthquakes and the casualty toll could rise, the Urumqi official said.
"We're not yet sure how many houses have collapsed. We only know initially that there were maybe more than 1,500 houses," the Jiashi official said. "Houses that are a bit shoddy might be done for now and are not fit to live in," she said.
Authorities in Jiashi had started relief activities and aid teams from other parts of Xinjiang were preparing to move in to help, the official in Urumqi said.
"Relief activities are just getting under way," he said.
Government officials in Jiashi could not immediately be reached for comment.
The tremor was one of several aftershocks from an earthquake of 6.4 magnitude that caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in Jiashi on January 21, the Jiashi seismological official said.
"This one was much smaller than the last earthquake," she said, adding that an aftershock of 5.0 that jostled Jiashi last week had barely been felt.
That aftershock was from a tremor measuring 5.3 earlier in February, she said. No casualties were reported in either of the smaller quakes.
The January earthquake caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in the area and the district has since been rocked by hundreds of aftershocks. More aftershocks were expected, officials said.

A Hong Kong member of the Chinese committee handling the territory's return handed a letter to Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday protesting against Beijing's plan to dilute civil liberties laws.
Frederick Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, handed the letter to Qian just before the start of a two-day plenary session of the 150-member Preparatory Committee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
"I gave a document to him in the hope he will study it," Fung told reporters. "I have a different view on the Preparatory Committee proposal to repeal several provisions of the Bill of Rights."
Beijing's plans to repeal or amend a list of 25 Hong Kong laws and ordinances, including parts of its Bill of Rights, will be debated at the session of the caucus responsible for shaping Hong Kong's future in the countdown to the handover this year.
The announcement this month from Beijing, which said the laws contradicted Hong Kong's future mini-constitution the Basic Law, has sparked outrage in the British colony and forceful objections from London and its allies.
"I feel if it doesn't violate the Basic Law it should not be retracted," Fung told reporters.
"If the Preparatory Committee abolishes the provisions of the Bill of Rights it will create unnecessary worries and be detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997," Fung said in his letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
Fung's protest followed an attack on Thursday by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten who lashed out at what he called China's repugnant proposal to dilute Hong Kong's civil liberties after it recovers the British colony at midnight on June 30.
"On the Bill of Rights, not only does it not contradict the Basic Law, but is necessary for implementing... the two regulations on adapting human rights conventions to Hong Kong," said the letter by Fung, who is also a member of the territory's Beijing-appointed provisional legislature.
"I believe the abolition of the above bill will bring instability to the rule of law in the future special region," he said. Fung's group advocates democracy for Hong Kong but through cooperation rather than confrontation with Beijing.
Fung also voiced opposition to China's decision to repeal recent Hong Kong regulations formally allowing political parties, warning that Beijing's decision to return to the British colonial era system would affect Hong Kong stability as well as its credibility.
"I believe that to restore these provisions is totally against developing toward the casting off of colonialism and against the principle of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong," he said in the letter.
Hong Kong's post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa, who is attending the crucial committee meeting in Beijing, argued in defence of Beijing's move that the international community had misconstrued the situation.
U.S. President Bill Clinton has expressed concern. Britain summoned the Chinese ambassador in London order to lodge a protest and Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind plans to pursue the issue in a meeting with Qian next month.
Qian has insisted the transition process is going well.

Negotiators from China and the United States resumed last-ditch talks on Saturday to hammer out a new textile accord and a deal on market access after extending for a day the deadline for a cross-Pacific trade war.
Chief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said she was confident of an agreement on Saturday in a fifth day of talks with officials of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
"We felt like we had made tremendous progress and we are looking to complete negotiations today," she told Reuters before leaving for the ministry. "You're always positive you can reach an agreement but you have to balance it out."
Hayes and Chinese officials wrangled late into Friday night to try to iron out problems in renewing a 1994 textile accord and to resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports.
The United States had extended by a day the deadline for agreement on a new textile accord with China, Hayes said.
"I felt like it was important to extend it, the deadline, for one day... so we could get a fresh start this morning," Hayes said as she left for the eleventh-hour talks.
"We did not complete the agreement... so we felt like we'd have one extra day to complete it," she said. "We didn't finish last night so we are re-evaluating where we are and will continue negotiations this morning."
She said the U.S. side was still focusing on two major demands -- its market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.
"The two main things that we have been consistently concerned about are the market access that China has to the United States... and also making sure that it is balanced, that we have a market access package from China," she said.
Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier.
However, they said hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement.
"I expect the reason for the talks not wrapping up is market access," said National Retail Federation vice-president Robert P. Hall said on Friday. "This is an issue that is not traditionally part of apparel bilaterals."
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the previous deadline of January 31, Hayes has said. The United States would not give China another extension of the deadline, she said.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries.

Premier Li Peng said on Saturday China would pursue a foreign policy of opening to the world pioneered by late leader Deng Xiaoping, citing ties with the United States and Europe as of particular importance.
Li, speaking at the start of the annual session of China's National People's Congress, or parliament, placed less emphasis on relations with Japan, China's neighbour and biggest trading partner.
He delivered his speech in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, a Maoist-era auditorium evocative of an earlier, less outward-looking period in communist China's foreign policy.
"China will unswervingly pursue the policy of opening to the outside world...," Li said after he and 2,800-odd parliamentary deputies had observed a brief silence for Deng, who died on February 19 aged 92.
"We wish to see further improvement in Sino-U.S. relations and the strengthening of Sino-European relations," he said, without going into detail.
China this week marked the 25th anniversary of the Shanghai Communique -- the starting point for the process of normalising Sino-U.S. relations -- by criticising Washington for failing to honour the terms of its agreements.
Relations between China and the United States deteriorated in 1995 and early 1996 due to disputes ranging from Taiwan to pirated software and illegal garbage shipments, and have improved only in recent months.
Both sides seemed happy with this week's visit to Beijing by new U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
Li referred to ties with Japan briefly.
"Sino-Japanese relations were once obstructed. We wish to see a normal development of relations between the two countries," he said.
Recent strains between the World War Two foes have included a flare-up in a long-standing dispute, also involving Taiwan and Hong Kong, over ownership of islets called Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese.
Li said China opposed interference in the internal affairs of other countries -- an apparent jab at outsiders who take China to task over its human rights record.
China is to announce on Sunday a 14.7 percent incrrease in its defence budget for 1997, Chinese sources said, but Li said China had no aggressive intentions.
"A developed China will not constitute a threat to any other country," he said.
Beijing defends its large increases in military spending by saying the base figure is still low and inflation cuts purchasing power.
China denies charges it is becoming a threat in Asia or to the rest of the world, but its military build-up has caused anxiety among neighbours.
The three-million-strong People's Liberation Army , the biggest in the world, ruffled feathers in the region in March 1996 when it held missile tests and war games close to Taiwan just before the island's presidential election.

Residents of China's capital voiced emotions ranging from shock and sadness to cold indifference after waking on Thursday morning to news of the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Extra police on Beijing's sunlit lanes and the bright red national flag flying at half-mast in Tiananmen Square were the only hints of a break from a routine after the early morning announcement that the greatest communist reformer of the 20th century was dead.
"My first reaction is great shock," said Liu Hongxin, a 21-year-old student waiting for a train in the pre-dawn chill at Beijing's main railway station.
Deng, the gravel-voiced mastermind of 18 years of reform that turned China from a backward Stalinist state into an emerging economic superpower, died of respiratory failure in an advanced stage of Parkinson's disease late on Wednesday. He was 92.
"I feel a great sadness," said snack vendor Xie Weicai as he prepared his pavement stove for the morning's business, but his regret was not universal among the capital's residents.
But others had quite different reactions.
"I would consider losing 100 yuan ($12) much sadder than the death of Deng Xiaoping," said one taxi driver on an early morning shift. "It has nothing to do with me."
It was business as usual on the capital's streets, with residents busy opening shops and crowding onto buses to go to work, in stark contrast to the paralysis that gripped China with the passing of Chairman Mao Zedong in 1976.
"Then we cried like we lost our father and mother," said one driver parked near Deng's central Beijing residence. "Now everyone is indifferent."
Analysts said the initial calm would probably be matched by a period of low-key political activity as China's leadership adjusted to the post-Deng era.
"There is going to be a lull," said Tai Ming Cheung, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong. "There may be a certain amount of policy paralysis... but beyond that I don't see any great changes."
Deng's death would prompt a surge in jockeying for political position among China's communist leaders, who are already preparing their positions for the crucial 15th Party Congress to be held in October, he said.
Deng's anointed heir, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, is considered favourite to assume the senior revolutionary's mantle of leadership, but analysts say Deng's death will also give rival pretenders to power a chance to boost their influence.
Police, some carrying assault rifles, stood guard at the end of the nearby lane in central Beijing where Deng had lived and patrolled the lanes around the Zhongnanhai government compound near the Forbidden City, former abode of China's emperors.
In Tiananmen Square, focus of pro-democracy protests in 1989 that were crushed on Deng's orders, residents and visitors gathered to see the dawn raising of China's flag.
The bright red flag emblazoned with five gold stars was raised to half-mast by a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, one of a squad that had marched up from the Forbidden City with bayonets at their shoulders.
While most bystanders were still unaware of Deng's passing, a few who braved the morning chill on the square -- still festively decorated for the Chinese Lunar New Year this month -- had heard the news and had come to say goodbye.
"I saw the news on the television this morning and came over to watch the flag-raising," said one factory worker from China's central Anhui province. "I wanted to pay my respects."

Deng Xiaoping was an avid bridge player who relished a croissant and a glass of milk, loved playing at the seaside with his grandchildren and did not balk at sending in the army to crush unarmed, rebellious students.
Chain-smoking until his fingers were stained brown and fond of keeping a spittoon at his feet in meetings with foreign dignitaries, the diminutive ruler possessed a personality as peppery as the cuisine of his native Sichuan province.
"Unsentimental and humorless, he seemed to have few qualms of conscience, and little compunction to ingratiate himself with others through convivial chatter," wrote Orville Schell in his book "Mandate of Heaven".
He was a "nasty little man", former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said of the man who ruled China for the 1980s and much of the 1990s and stood just 1.50 metres (5 ft) in the white socks he preferred.
He failed equally to charm Britain's Margaret Thatcher.
But Deng was a man who didn't seem to care about what people thought -- even when it cost him his political career.
In 1966, as Chairman Mao Zedong was setting in motion a devastating campaign to weed out opposition to his leadership, Deng flaunted expected codes of loyalty by evading mandatory attendance of a series of revolutionary operas.
Finally coerced into making an appearance, he dozed off in mid-performance, unconcerned that he was making a lifelong enemy of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, who designed the operas and had Deng banished far from Beijing in ensuing political purges.
Unrepentant and unfazed, Deng busied himself with a small garden in central Jiangxi province, growing cabbages, potatoes and garlic to supplement the meagre salary he drew as a worker at a tractor repair factory.
It was in internal exile that Deng grew to love the game of bridge, honing his skill by playing all four positions alone and carefully studying the intricacies of strategy.
It became a lifelong passion -- many of his favoured aides were bridge partners. But he never played for money, requiring only that the loser crawl around on all fours under the table.
Alhough Deng had shed all his official posts by 1990, he still retained one title at the time of his death on Wednesday -- honorary chairman of the China Bridge Players Association. Bridge was, in his words, "a game for great personalities".
A youth spent in France in the 1920s instilled in the young revolutionary a lifelong penchant for croissants and milk.
Hoping to acquire some of the pastries on a visit to a United Nations meeting in 1974, Deng took advantage of a stopover in Paris to buy 100 croissants, returning to share them with premier Zhou Enlai and other friends from his Paris days.
He also smoked two packs a day of Panda-brand cigarettes -- a half-filter, half-tobacco cigarette available only to China's top leaders. He gave up the habit in 1989.
He was also not averse to a swig of the fiery white Chinese liquor that is de rigeur for toasting at banquets. Unable to afford spirits when in the political wilderness, he drank beer.
He kept fit with daily walks around his spacious compound down a narrow, leafy alley in central Beijing and swam each summer at the seaside resort of Beidhaihe, where he would take a dip in the ocean for an hour every day, come rain or shine.
Always mindful of puritan communist values of frugality and modesty, Deng never appeared dressed in anything other than an austere Mao suit of blue or grey.
He relaxed on his 1979 tour of the United States when he endeared himself to his hosts by accepting a pair of cowboy boots from singer John Denver, donning a 10-gallon cowboy hat and riding around a Texas rodeo in a stagecoach.
Deng was also an ardent fan of soccer -- China's most popular sport -- and watched 50 of the 52 matches in the 1990 World Cup.
Deng set himself apart from Mao, who was worshipped in a frenzied personality cult, preferring to keep a low, private profile.
He cherished his role as a husband and father, finding time to spend with his five children, bringing his grandchildren along on official tours and playing with them at the beach.
"He is rather philosophical on the question of personal fate... optimistic in the face of adversity," Deng's daughter Deng Rong once wrote of her father.

Chinese police cordoned off a South Korean embassy compound on Thursday and North Korean diplomats lurked outside as an official from Seoul met the most senior North Korean to defect from the Stalinist state.
But Beijing officials, apparently angered by Seoul's decision to export its latest row with Pyongyang into China, avoided meeting Kim Ha-jung, a special adviser to South Korean Foreign Yoo Chong-ha, South Korean sources said.
South Korean embassy officials had earlier said the Seoul Foreign Ministry envoy was meeting Chinese officials to discuss the fate of the defector, Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Chinese police blocked streets to Seoul's consular section in the sedate, tree-lined diplomatic district of Beijing, and embassy officials said Hwang and his assistant were inside.
Hwang, 73, is one of the chief architects of North Korean communism, and the highest ranking official from the world's last Stalinist state to seek asylum in the South.
Kim met Hwang in the consular office, South Korean sources said. No other details were available.
China avoided direct comment after finding itself in the eye of a diplomatic storm involving its old communist comrade and a new commercial ally and major source of investment, choosing instead to appeal for calm.
"Regarding the transit through Beijing by Hwang Jang-yop, we were not notified in advance," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, in a signal of China's anger.
"We hope the parties concerned can deal with this matter calmly and on the basis of the overall circumstances, and appropriately handle this to safeguard the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula," the spokesman added.
Previous, low-profile defectors from the North have made their way quietly through China, apparently after making contact with the South Korean embassy, but Seoul did not publicise their journey until they were out of China.
Seoul announced Hwang's defection on Wednesday.
South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha was to meet his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen in Singapore on Friday morning at 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) to discuss the diplomatic crisis.
In a sign of the suspicion that underscores dealings between North and South, South Korean embassy officials accused North Koreans of trying to force their way into the consular office and called for Chinese police protection.
Diplomats from Pyongyang sat in parked cars outside the consular compound and waited outside the embassy, watching from behind police cordons.
"Last night, North Korean people who we believe were from the embassy tried to enter our consular section," embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik told reporters. Chinese police on guard prevented the North Koreans from entering, he said.
"We have asked the Chinese government to protect our embassy compound... against North Koreans and any unexpected (incidents)," he said.
He dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang, one of 11 secretaries on the powerful secretariat of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, had been kidnapped by the South, saying Hwang had arrived in a taxi and voluntarily sought asylum.
North Korean diplomats stood by the kidnapping charge.
"I think South Korea has kidnapped these two officials," said one of several North Korean officials waiting in the office tower housing Seoul's embassy. "The impossible has happened."
"We expect that the Chinese side will take appropriate measures in this regard," a North Korean official said.
South and North Korea were separated at the end of World War Two and fought a war from 1950 to 1953. China fought on North Korea's side in the conflict.

South Korea on Monday hinted that talks with China over the fate of a senior North Korean defector sheltering in Seoul's mission in Beijing could drag on while Beijing is busy with its annual parliament session.
"We didn't get any resolution from the Chinese government so far," South Korean Embassy spokesman Chang Moon-ik said of the negotiations over Hwang Jang-yop, the Stalinist nation's top ideologue.
Hwang has been holed up in Seoul's consular compound in Beijing since February 12, surrounded by Chinese police with assault rifles, an anti-riot truck and armoured personnel carriers.
Chang declined to say when a resolution to the Cold War standoff being waged in the Chinese capital could be expected, saying Chinese officials were preoccupied with the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), or parliament.
"I think they are very busy because the national assembly is going on," he said, adding that Seoul officials were continuing to maintain contacts with their Chinese counterparts.
In his annual government work report made to the opening session of the congress on Saturday, Chinese Premier Li Peng made no mention of the crisis, but said Beijing hoped for stability on the Korean peninsula.
"The Chinese government has all along attached importance to and worked hard for the maintenance of a stable situation in the Korean peninsula," Li said.
The NPC opened on Saturday and is to meet for two weeks.
The new interruption comes shortly after the talks were stalled when China observed six days of mourning for the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Beijing has found itself entangled in the showdown between the rival Koreas and now is trying to resolve the crisis without offending an old communist comrade or a new business partner.
Analysts say China is almost certain to grant Hwang safe passage to Seoul, but wants to help its hermit neighbour save face by being seen to give Pyongyang's concerns due attention.
The defection of Hwang, a senior aide to top leader Kim Jong-Il and the architect of the North's ideology of strict self-reliance, further strained ties between the Koreas. But there have been signs in recent days the crisis may be easing.
Pyongyang, which at first insisted Hwang had been kidnapped by South Korean agents, has since vowed to dismiss the ideologue if he had in fact defected.
Near famine conditions in North Korea and apparent disaffection among some members of the ruling elite has prompted a string of defections in recent months.
In another daring flight from North Korea, a man whose family reportedly fell foul of Pyongyang's communist government arrived at Seoul international airport on Sunday after hiding out in China since October 1992.
Last Thursday, a North Korean woman in her 20s fled barefoot to the South through the heavily mined and guarded Demilitarised Zone that has split the Korean peninsula since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
Adding to an impression of instability, the country's defence minister and his deputy died in quick succession last month, and the prime minister was replaced.

Four publicly traded startup companies formed to help computer users surf the World Wide Web are now fighting it out in a battle that promises to circle the world at high speed.
Since the flurry of their initial public offerings this spring, all four -- Yahoo! Inc., Excite Inc., Infoseek and Lycos Inc. -- have been busy trying to establish a beachhead on the Internet.
At issue is a solid shot at establishing leading brands for years to come for serving as the gateway to help people weave their way through the Internet's extensive, but still unruly, World Wide Web.
The stakes are high for establishing navigation hubs which could be "the ultimate power brokers" at the center of major traffic flows on the Internet, said John McCarthy, director of research for interactive technology strategies at Forrester Research.
He also said the fledgling companies need to offer more than the initial scattershot Web search approach he said was akin to "a drive-by shooting."
"Users are getting more sophisticated and they need more than just pointers," he said.
McCarthy and others involved in the industry expect those who are successful in the next 12 to 18 months to attract even greater attention, and perhaps even acquisition offers, from the industry's largest players.
"Oracle, Microsoft and Netscape are not going to stand by and watch," McCarthy said.
All four of the newly public firms are developing and improving personal services by providing a sort of custom electronic front page on the Internet and most are looking overseas as well as to domestic deals to expand their reach.
For its part, Yahoo! -- started two years ago by two Stanford University graduate students -- has focused sharply on developing and extending its brand name, developing sites for three U.S. metropolitan areas and in Japan. Yahoo! also expects to launch country services for Britain, Germany and France in the next few weeks.
At an industry conference Monday, Yahoo Chief Executive Tim Koogle said the company was seeking to build on its lead in market share and advertising by spreading Yahoo's brand internationally and in a variety of services.
"You come to Yahoo! to find information and consume it," he said. "The brand is important. Technology is important, too, but people don't want to have to care about that."
While customers are most interested in ease of use, the companies have their eyes on the potentially billions of dollars in advertising that may find a home on the Internet.
Infoseek President Robin Johnson, whose company has developed speedy new Ultra search technology, said there was upwards pressure on advertising rates, currently at around $21 per thousand views.
Excite President George Bell, whose company launched a service this week using technology that updates a personalized service based on an individual's usage patterns, said ultra-customized services could one day produce highly-targeted ad rates of up to $200 per thousand views.
Koogle said a projected $2.5 billion in Web advertising by the year 2000 -- some 1 percent to 2 percent of estimated total advertising spending, was not unreasonable.
How much of that will flow to navigation companies and their ability to continue to attract the eyes of computer users still remains a critical question.
Koogle said a 20 percent to 30 percent share for the sector's ability to provide "a share of eyeballs" may be possible.

Sun Microsystems Inc. and its heavyweight partners Wednesday launched a series of initiatives aimed at making its Java software perform more speedily on devices ranging from "smart cards" to supercomputers.
The announcements by Sun and Java partners like computer power International Business Machines Corp., software giant Microsoft Corp. and Web browser leader Netscape Communications Corp. came at the second annual JavaOne software developers' conference in San Francisco.
Analysts see Java -- a computer language which promises to enable programmers to write one piece of software that can run on many different systems -- as a technology that will eventually creep into pretty much every company's computers.
Sun said it would introduce a stronger Java for Microsoft's dominant Windows operating system this summer and would further enhance Java's performance and security by the end of the year.
The company, which before Java was best known for its computer workstations, said it also had devised Java variants optimized for devices ranging from large data center computers to smaller, hand-held machines and even pagers and cellular phones.
On the hardware side, Sun announced licensing and partnership agreements with companies like Japan's Toshiba Corp. which will put semiconductors designed around Java in a variety of devices from cellular phones to television set-top boxes, navigational devices known as global positioning systems and the aircraft electronics known as avionics.
A previously announced version of Java software that will run on older personal computers using Microsoft DOS will be dubbed JavaPC and will be available this fall for less than $100 for machines using Intel 486 and Pentium microprocessors.
The company estimates JavaPC will offer new life to some 180 million such PCs.
Java, unveiled just two years ago, has produced an awkward alliance among fiercely competitive rivals. Wednesday's proceedings at San Francisco's Moscone Center, which was packed by thousands of software developers, were highlighted by the usual industry controversy.
Down the hall from where Sun Chief Executive Officer Scott McNeally and other major Java figures were giving keynote addresses, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates was due to show off his company's Java work later in the day.
"Certainly, the center of the nuclear attack is going to be right here at ground zero in San Francisco," Gartner Group analyst David Smith said of the dueling speeches.
Sun hopes that by de-emphasizing individual platforms, especially Microsoft's Windows, it can level the playing field and extend sales of computer systems like its Solaris, which runs on the Unix operating system.
Gates, who is not used to playing second fiddle, and other industry players over time are expected to vie with Sun for leadership of the growing number of developers entranced by Java, now estimated at 400,000.

Hewlett-Packard Co. Monday announced price cuts of up to 41 percent for its computer workstations in a bid to win back market share for its products.
Analysts said the move was aimed at reversing recent gains by rival Sun Microsystems Inc. in workstations, the powerful desktop computers used in technical and engineering work.
"This price cut is the opening salvo in determining how competitive they're going to be," said Joe Ferlazzo, analyst at Technology Business Research in Hampton, N.H.
The price cuts range from 27 percent to 41 percent. For example, the price for the higher-end HP Visualize Model C180 equipped with a 20-inch colour monitor was slashed by 32 percent, to $34,995 (corrects price from $43,995) from $51,500.
At the lower end, the price of the HP Visualize Model B132l was cut to $6,795 from $11,500, the company said.
The new pricing corresponds with Hewlett-Packard's plan to make its workstations more like personal computers by trimming expenses and passing on expected savings to customers.
The strategy is aimed at rivals such as Digital Equipment Corp., Silicon Graphics Inc. and especially Sun, widely regarded as the low-cost producer of workstations.
Sun Microsystems raised its market share to 41 percent in the workstation business in 1996, more than its three nearest competitors combined, as the overall workstation market shrank by 1 percent to $15 billion, according to data from International Data Corp, a market research firm.
Managers at Hewlett-Packard's workstation operations said the new pricing was aimed directly at its competition.
"It is a very significant change," said Andrew Allison, publisher of the newsletter Inside the New Computing Industry.
"HP has not heretofore been a price leader or expressed the intent to be a price-performance leader."
But Hewlett-Packard's move was unlikely to go unnoticed by rivals in the fiercely competitive sector.
Executives at Sun Microsystems, which cut its prices last quarter, told analysts last week it was prepared to make further aggressive price cuts in the power workstation market it now dominates.
"Sun is the low-cost producer," said Allison. "Sun is in the best position to deal with this issue and I would expect Sun to respond to HP's moves."

Hewlett-Packard Co., seeking to extend its position as a leader in electronic commerce, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire VeriFone Inc. in a stock swap worth $1.18 billion.
Hewlett-Packard said VeriFone, a leader in electronic payment hardware and software, will be operated as an independent unit of HP. Verifone stockholders will receive one HP share for each VeriFone share, the company said.
The acquisition is a big step in HP's drive to develop products for what it calls the "on-ramps" and "off-ramps" of the information superhighway, a business that includes computer printers and scanners, where Hewlett-Packard already has a dominant market share.
In an intervew last week the company's top Internet executive, Ira Goldstein, said Hewlett-Packard aimed to become the information appliance supplier to the fast-growing market for Internet technology.
The Internet portion of the electronic commerce market alone is expected to reach $95 billion in the United States by the year 2000, according to research by International Data Corp.
HP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year.
The acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. As of Monday, VeriFone had 23.3 million shares of common stock outstanding, the companies said.
HP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.
Verifone jumped $17.625, or 59 percent, to $47.75 in very heavy trading on the NYSE, after initially being halted, as investors priced in the value of the stock swap.
Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone, which was founded in 1981 and pioneered automated credit card transaction systems, has recently expanded to include conducting business over the Internet and "smart-card" products for homes.
Smart cards have imbedded computer chips that can store so-called electronic cash and other information.
Just last week, Citicorp's Citibank launched a pilot programme with VeriFone to test smart card use that will allow selected customers to download funds onto smart cards using devices in the home or office.
VeriFone estimates that its systems handled more than $520 billion of the $800 billion in electronic transactions conducted in the United States last year.
HP said the two companies' technologies complement each other, with HP's focus on Internet security technologies and major corporate markets melding with VeriFone's expertise in moving money.
"Central to HP's strategy to achieve this vision is the ability to move money securely from end to end over the Internet, an area VeriFone has pioneered through products and strategic relationships," HP Executive Vice President Rick Belluzzo said.
The companies' relationship also includes providing products for the Visa/MasterCard Secure Electronic Transaction protoco, which is beginning to roll out this year, for secure credit-card payments over the Internet.

Making use of technologies originally developed for supercomputers, Sun Microsystems Inc. will this week unveil its first high-end computer servers that can compete with mainframe performance.
"It's not just a hot box," said Ed Zander, president of the Sun Microsystems Computer Co. "We look at this as combining the best of the mainframe world and the traditional Unix-server world."
The machines also are capable of more than four times the processing performance of an International Business Machines Corp.  mainframe, according to data supplied by Sun.
The new Ultra Enterprise 10000 servers, which were code named Starfire, will be formally unveiled on Wednesday morning at a San Francisco news briefing and analysts expect them to further boost Sun's already roaring sales growth.
The servers will be Sun's first machines priced in the $500,000 to $2 million range, offering stronger margin potential and extending the company's computer line to the heavy-duty machines used in corporate data centers.
The Mountain View, Calif. company last week reported its second fiscal quarter revenues jumped 19 percent to a record $2.08 billion, and net income soared 41 percent to $178.3 million, helped by sales of server products.
Goldman Sachs analyst Laura Conigliaro estimates that Sun's sales of servers -- machines which serve at the center of computer networks which are capable of intensive calculations -- grew in excess of 45 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
Sun also boosted its market share leadership in the fiercely competitive but weakening Unix workstation market in 1996, winning a 41 percent stake of the $15 billion market, a position larger than its next three rivals combined, according to a preliminary International Data Corp. survey.
The base Starfire configuration -- with 16 processors and two gigabytes of memory -- will be priced starting at $873,890 and the machines will begin shipping in limited quantity this week, with volume shipments due around two months from now.
Analysts and industry consultants said the computers will for the first time enable Sun to compete at the top end of the market with machines capable of handling the largest mission- critical tasks like online transaction processing.
"I think this is going to open up some new market segments for them," said a consultant at N.H.-based Technology Business Research. "Sun's sales force has been unusually successful in selling in competitive environments."
Sun was able to take advantage of supercomputer-like performance features developed by Cray Business Systems. Rival Silicon Graphics Inc., which bought Cray Research last year, sold the former Cray division to Sun last May.
The Cray team had already developed a machine based on Sun's Sparc/Solaris system that can run 64 processors.
Sun is augmenting its new offering with powerful storage systems it says offers strong price-performance advantages.
Among the features which distinguish the new computer systems are the ability to provide 10 times the amount of bandwidth of other Unix systems and 50 percent more than top- of-the-line mainframe computer models.
The system can run at two to four times the power of an IBM mainframe as measured by million instructions per second, a standard measurement of computer speed, Sun said.
"This is deep into mainframe territory," said Andrew Allison, publisher of Inside the New Computer Industry.
Zander said Starfire may not be a straight-out replacement for mainframe computers, but that customers may chose to shift major Unix applications to the Starfire technology, which can also be partitioned in the same way mainframes can.
IDC analyst Jay Bretzmann projects the market for high-end Unix machines alone is around $2 billion now, and growing very rapidly in a total marketspace valued at around $50 billion.
Sun said the Ultra Enterprise 10000 has set a record in an industry performance benchmark test known as the Transaction Performance Council Benchmark D.
Analysts expect the machines to challenge rivals like Digital Equipment Corp., whose Alpha machines had topped the performance curves, and Hewlett-Packard Co., which was a pioneer in the high-end server market, and IBM.
A number of organizations are in line for orders for the machine, including insurance giant Aetna Inc., the German maratime traffic agency BSH, health information services provider HCIA and the Kelly Services staffing agency.
Rich Castor, technology officer at Aetna, said he chose the new Sun computers in competition with rival offerings because it brings mainframe-class capabilities to servers while using server-based applications packages.
"In this case, it allows us to marry mainframe class computing environments with some of the best of breed client- server applications programs," such as those of Oracle Corp. and Peoplesoft, he said. "We're very impressed."

The legal barrage by Netscape Communications Corp. against arch-rival Microsoft Corp. may end up dampening investors' enthusiasm for both stocks, analysts said on Wednesday.
Gary Reback, Netscape's outside counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, has urged the Department of Justice to take immediate action against Microsoft for alleged violations of its 1994 consent decree and antitrust laws.
Separately, Tim O'Reilly, head of Internet publisher O'Reilly &amp; Associates, said he was recently approached by a Justice Department official asking about Microsoft's behaviour, perhaps indicating fresh interest in the matter.
Microsoft, which has weathered legal battles successfully in the past, has rebuffed the allegations, saying Netscape's claims are "full of wild and unsubstantiated statements."
The software giant went on the offensive Wednesday, accusing Netscape of failing to live up to its own promises that it would support open Internet standards.
"Netscape should take a good look at themselves in the mirror," said Brad Chase, vice president or marketing for Microsoft's Internet division, noting Netscape had blocked users of Microsoft's browser from parts of the Netscape site.
Nevertheless, analysts noted the market has a distaste for legal uncertainty, and investors were likely to start factoring in at least some degree of risk that the battle could escalate into a full-fledged government investigation or lawsuit.
"The legal risk is starting to get heightened on this," said Montgomery Securities analyst David Readerman, who covered Microsoft during Apple Computer Inc.'s failed five-year copyright lawsuit against the software giant.
Microsoft also was probed by the Federal Trade Commission and, subsequently, the Justice Department for five years until its July 1994 signing of a consent decree agreeing to alter the way it licenses operating system software.
That accord was viewed by some of its software rivals as having been lenient, and Netscape's lawyer asked the Justice Department in a letter released Tuesday to examine whether Microsoft was now using its control over computer operating systems improperly.
In both cases, analysts noted that the hint of further legal difficulties could dampen further advances in the companies' stocks as the market seeks to sort out the business impact, if any.
"We've been there with the Apple vs Microsoft and we've been there with the (Justice Department) and the experience is that these stocks tend to stall as the market tries to figure out what the risk is all about," said Readerman.
Microsoft stock closed up 12.5 cents at $123.50, while Netscape was unchanged at $37.25, both on Nasdaq.
Lawyers in Washington, D.C., said they doubt the Justice Department would find Microsoft had acted improperly, based on the charges leveled against the company by Netscape.
Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape alleged through its letter to the DOJ that Microsoft had offered "clandestine side payments" and discounts on its operating system, and other inducements, to promote use of its own Internet browser.
The lawyers contacted by Reuters noted that while Microsoft dominates the PC operating system market with around a 90 percent share, Netscape has an estimated 80 percent share of the market for Internet browser software.
"In the browser category, Netscape is the elephant and Microsoft is the mouse," said Robert Skitol of Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath. "It's a bit of a stretch to call what Microsoft is described as doing a violation of the consent decree or a violation of antitrust laws."

Sun Microsystems Inc. said Monday it will move to build on the momentum behind its Java computer programming language despite overtures by Microsoft Corp. to co-opt Sun's initiative.
The president of Sun's JavaSoft unit, Alan Baratz, said the company will unveil several new initiatives at the second annual JavaOne software developers' conference in San Francisco later this week.
At the same time, some developers were buzzing with expectation that Microsoft on Wednesday may spell out its own plans for Java, including some which may not sit well with other Java licensees.
As the dominant supplier of operating systems for personal computers, Microsoft is among the more critical licensees of Java, which promises to operate across otherwise incompatible computing systems.
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Bill Gates is due to address a software developers conference in one hall of San Francisco's Moscone Center the same day JavaSoft unveils its latest initiatives in another part of the same convention center.
Microsoft would not comment Monday on its plans, but the showdown follows a months-long tug of war between the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant and Sun's JavaSoft unit.
Earlier this year, Sun teamed up with International Business Machines Corp., Netscape Communications Corp. and Novell Inc. to launch a "100 percent pure Java" branding campaign aimed at ensuring Java retains its ability to work on multiple computer systems.
The initiative was designed to keep Microsoft -- or any other licensees -- from appropriating the technology, according to its proponents.
Microsoft, meanwhile, complained Sun had deliberately made a new Java version incompatible with recent releases of Microsoft's Windows.
Two weeks ago, JavaSoft applied to become a standards-setting body which could submit Java and its various upgrades to become standards under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization.
At the time, a Microsoft executive complained Sun was not surrendering the Java branding and compliance process to the standards board, an action JavaSoft retorted would break with industry practice.
Michael Kwatinetz, the lead analyst in Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's high technology group, said Microsoft's objective is to stay at the forefront of the software development community by continuing to extend its tools into the hot Java arena.
In an interview ahead of JavaOne, which starts Wednesday after a Tuesday gathering of Java licensees, Baratz said Sun was introducing a combination of new products and specifications aimed at the server computers used by large organizations for handling computer networks.
He also said that, as a separate intitiative, Sun will announce sharply scaled-down varieties of Java -- PersonalJava and EmbeddedJava -- which will be able to work on a variety of small devices.
These would bring Java to personal digital assistants such as Apple Computers Inc.'s Newton, copiers and even smart cards, as well as televisions, pagers and cellular phones, changing the definition of what a computer is, according to Javasoft executives.
"The momentum behind Java continues to grow," said Baratz, adding the JavaOne show is sold out with more than 9,000 developers registered and an estimated 400,000 developers now seriously using Java worldwide.

Undeterred by recent market worries over the networking sector, Cisco Systems Inc chief executive John Chambers said he continued to see the industry's overall business growing at a brisk clip in 1997.
"We see a very good market at 30 to 50 percent growth for the forseeable future," Chambers told Reuters in an interview after a conference call with analysts in which he repeated Cisco's goal of outperforming the market's growth.
Cisco's second quarter results narrowly beat Wall Street estimates, rebuffing market talk on Tuesday of a shortfall.
Cisco reported that net income rose nearly 62 percent to $339.5 million in its second quarter to January 25 compared with $209.7 million a year earlier. Net sales rose 73 percent to $1.59 billion from $918.5 million a year earlier.
Analysts said Cisco's pro forma net income of $351.9 million, or $0.51 a share, excluding an acquisition-related writeoff and a net gain from sale of an investment, topped First Call's mean analysts estimate of $0.50 a share and roughly equalled Wall Street's $0.51-$0.52 "whisper number."
Chambers said the firm expected to acquire another 10 to 12 companies in its current year. "Almost every market segment has opportunity for internal products, joint development projects with our partners and acquisitions," he told Reuters.
Cisco shares, which had ended the Nasdaq market session down 1-1/8 at 67-1/8 before the results were released, slid as low as 64-1/4 in after-market trade. Some analysts attributed the decline to concerns the company's post-exceptional $0.49 a share earnings number had fallen short of expectations.
Analysts said Cisco executives in their conference call had addressed concerns over a possible slowing in the market, sparked by comments attributed to rival 3Com Corp.
Several analysts said they saw no sign that any December sluggishness observed by 3Com had a major impact on Cisco's business.
"I think it was another good solid quarter from Cisco. No hint of any problems," said Paul Saunders of Van Kasper &amp; Co.
Chambers said a shortening of order lead times -- down to one to three weeks now from eight to 12 weeks previously -- meant quarterly shifts in results may be more pronounced. He repeated previous comments that "sometime in the future, we'll see a quarter that is in single-digit growth."
Analysts said sequential growth in revenues from one quarter to the next -- such as the second quarter's more than 10 percent rise from the first fiscal quarter -- would still provide sharp year-on-year increases.
A second quarter gross margin of 65.3 percent surprised some analysts who had been expecting price competition to cut into margins. But Chambers said: "Our overall guidance is over time...margins will continue to go down."
"There will be a few (quarters) up, but I think most of them will be down, hopefully just slightly."
Smith Barney analyst Therese Murphy noted Cisco's third quarter tended to be weak, but saw no reason to be "any more cautious than we normally would be in the April quarter."
Chambers did not see any fundamental industry change, and continued to target growth above the industry rate while taking advantage of further consolidation, she said.

Intuit Inc. said Monday it would swap its Intuit Services Corp. bill payment and bank services unit to CheckFree Corp. for $260 million worth of CheckFree stock.
Mountain View, Calif.-based Intuit, which pioneered personal and small business financial software, also launched a far-reaching initiative to accelerate adpotion of electronic financial data exchange and commmunications over the Internet.
Wall Street applauded Intuit's decision to trade its private network bank services business, which it acquired in 1994, for 12.6 million shares of CheckFree common stock. On the Nasdaq, Intuit rose $2.125 to $32.25 while Columbus, Ohio-based CheckFree gained $3.19 to $21.25.
Lehman Brothers analyst Michael Stanek said he believed Intuit had received "an excellent price" from CheckFree.
"By selling Intuit Services Corp., we believe that investors will breathe a sigh of relief as Intuit has decided to exit the transaction processing business and will begin to focus efforts on its front-end software products," he said.
Scott Cook, Intuit's co-founder and chairman, said in a statement that the original investment two years ago had enabled Intuit to provide a secure private network connection between customers and financial service providers.
But now, he said, rapid advances in the safety and reliability of the Internet have made it the central focus of Intuit's strategy.
"Our goal is to speed the adoption of electronic connections between individuals, small businesses and financial service providers," he said.
Intuit produces TurboTax, the best-selling tax preparation software; and QuickBooks, the most popular small business accounting software. Its Quicken program is the leading personal finance software.
Intuit, which has 12 million personal finance customers -- both individuals and small businesses -- said it would facilitate the growth of links across the Internet by coordinating an industry framework for electronic data exchange dubbed OpenExchange.
Intuit said it planned to put Internet connections into place for online investment next spring, with online banking and bill payment activities in the fall of next year.
CheckFree said its acquisition would expand its home banking and bill payment services to more than 180 financial institutions and more than 1 million customers.
CheckFree Chairman Pete Kight said he expected all major banking institutions to begin establishing electronic transaction capabilities within the next 12 months.
CheckFree said its open set-up enables financial institutions to offer home banking and payment using personal computers, touch-tone phones and the Internet.
The swap occurs as use of the Internet for online financial transactions, rather than private networks, shows signs of taking off after a period of modest penetration.
David Weisman, an analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting firm Forrester Research Inc., said the number of U.S. households doing online banking is expected to grow to 9.1 million by the year 2001 from 1.1 million today.
Intuit Service accounted for less than 3 percent of Intuit's revenues in fiscal 1996. Intuit said it was selling about 2 million CheckFree shares acquired in the transaction, which Kight said brings its holdings below 20 percent.
Separately, Intuit said its losses widened to $22 million, or 48 cents a share, in its fourth fiscal quarter ended July 31 from $1.4 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 26 percent to $91.1 million from $72.4 million.
The results include an $8 million acquisition charge, higher spending in customer service and technical support, and bill payment processing startup expenses at Intuit Services.
Cook said Intuit must invest in research and development and marketing to address the Internet, which is growing faster than first anticipated, and he expected lower revenue growth and a modest increase in operating margins in fiscal 1997.
"We will continue to run our business focusing on long-term results, not quarterly results," he said.

Hewlett-Packard Co., seeking to forge rapidly into the fast-growing area of electronic commerce, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire VeriFone Inc. in a stock swap worth $1.18 billion.
Hewlett-Packard said VeriFone, a leader in electronic payment hardware and software, will be operated as an independent unit of HP. Verifone stockholders will receive one HP share for each VeriFone share, the company said.
Forrester Research estimates the market for business to business electronic commerce will jump from $600 million last year to $66 billion in the year 2000, with consumer retail business rising to $7 billion from $530 million in 1996.
"When you talk about online commerce today, invariably you're talking about online payment. VeriFone is going to be the diamond in the crown in this area for some time to come," said Forrester Research analyst Karen Epper.
HP said the proposed acquisition would combine its strength as the second-largest U.S.-based computer equipment company with VeriFone's leadership in electronic commerce. VeriFone had net revenue of $472 million in its 1996 fiscal year.
The acquisition price of about $1.18 billion was based on HP's closing stock price of $50.50 a share Tuesday. HP's stock slipped by $1 to $49.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.
Verifone jumped $17.625, or 59 percent, to $47.75, also in heavy trading on the NYSE.
JP Morgan analyst Daniel Kunstler said the deal provides HP with some "lynchpin technologies" for electronic commerce, and although it will be slightly dilutive to HP's current fiscal year earnings, the impact should be less than one percent.
Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone, which was founded in 1981 and pioneered automated credit card transaction systems, has recently expanded to include conducting business over the Internet and using "smart-card" products for the home.
Smart cards have imbedded computer chips that can store so-called electronic cash and other information.
Just last week, Citicorp's Citibank said it will launch a pilot program with VeriFone to test smart card use that will allow selected customers to download funds onto smart cards using its devices in their home or office.
VeriFone estimates that its systems handled more than $520 billion of the $800 billion in electronic transactions conducted in the United States last year.
The acquisition is a further step in HP's drive to develop products for what it calls the "on-ramps" and "off-ramps" of the information superhighway, a business that includes computer printers and scanners, where HP is a dominant player already.
HP said the two companies' technologies complement each other, with HP's focus on Internet security technologies and major corporate markets, including its broad distribution channels, melding with VeriFone's expertise in moving money.
"Central to HP's strategy to achieve this vision is the ability to move money securely from end to end over the Internet, an area VeriFone has pioneered through products and strategic relationships," HP Executive Vice President Rick Belluzzo said.
The companies' relationship includes providing products for the Visa/MasterCard Secure Electronic Transaction protocol, which is being rolled out this year, for secure credit-card payments over the Internet.
Analysts noted that other firms, many of them fledgeling startups like Cybercash, in which VeriFone holds a 10 percent stake, are also competing in what they expect will be an explosive market for electronic commerce systems and services.

China has jailed two Mongolians for up to 15 years on charges of separatism and espionage, the London-based human rights group Amnesty International said on Thursday.
Hada, 41, former manager of the Mongolian Academic Bookshop, and Tegexi, 30, who worked in the Inner Mongolian Bureau of Foreign Affairs, were sentenced last December to 15 and 10 years in prison respectively, Amnesty said.
Chinese courts rejected their appeals last month and upheld their original sentences, it said. The pair had been held for a year in solitary confinement without charges or a trial.
"No evidence has been made public to show that Hada and Tegexi were involved in any activity which may be regarded as criminal under international standards," Amnesty said.
It called for their immediate and unconditional release.
The Amnesty report could not be independently confirmed. Officials in China could not be reached for comment on the eve of Lunar New Year holidays.
Amnesty said eight others were detained in December for alleged involvement in "nationalist separatist" activities, but were subsequently released.
Inner Mongolia, a Chinese province, is populated mainly by ethnic Mongolians but there has been little sign of anti-Chinese unrest since the early years after the 1949 communist takeover and the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when dissent was crushed.
However, in late 1995, authorities in Inner Mongolia arrested 12 people who had demanded more democracy and an autonomous region, according to human rights groups.
Hada and Tegexi were being detained in poor conditions and their health was suffering, Amnesty said. They were living in a cell in Inner Mongolia's Number One Prison with over 30 other people, the report added.
Hada has a recurrence of tuberculosis and his neck was swollen, the group said. It was not known if he had received any medical treatment in prison.
Beijing-based Western analysts say China has tightened its grip on dissent and separatist sentiment ahead of the British colony of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule on July 1.
"The harsh sentences passed on Hada and Tegexi are indicative of the severe attitude taken during the past year by the Chinese authorities towards suspected nationalists in...Tibet and Xinjiang," Amnesty said.
Inner Mongolia has traditionally been less restive than Tibet and Xinjiang.
Tibet has been rocked in recent years by periodic unrest, which China blames on the Himalayan region's god-king, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India after an abortive uprising against communist rule in 1959.
Xinjiang borders Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states. The region has been shaken in recent months by several clashes and political killings involving separatists who want to end communist rule in Xinjiang.
"This 'crackdown' has also affected those whose peaceful religious activities are deemed to threaten 'national unity' and 'social stability'," Amnesty said.

Beijing's propaganda machine has accused the United States of using Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, as a tool to Westernise and break up China.
"Western countries, led by the United States, have directed the focal point of their 'Westernisation' and 'disintegration' (campaign) at China," the Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Tuesday.
"(They) have made the Dalai Lama clique their tool to implement this anti-Chinese strategy," the newspaper said, noting that the West had showered awards on the Dalai Lama, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.
China has rarely singled out a country for backing the Dalai Lama, one Chinese analyst said.
Sino-U.S. relations have been strained in recent years by disputes over Tibet as well as Beijing's diplomatic rival Taiwan, human rights abuses and widespread copyright piracy in China.
China blames followers of the Dalai Lama for periodic unrest in the Himalayan region bordering India.
The Dalai Lama says says he wants autonomy and freedom of worship in his deeply Buddhist homeland. He fled China into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule.
The December 30 edition of the Tibet Daily slammed Western criticism of China's human rights record in the region, saying critics "confused black with white".
"Sovereign rights are much more important than human rights," the newspaper said, quoting 92-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
"The sovereignty and security of the state should be placed first," it said.
The newspaper argued that communist rule protected the rights of the majority of Tibetans by ending slavery and raising living standards.
Tibet has been rocked in recent years by sporadic, sometimes violent, anti-Chinese unrest with monks and nuns often at the forefront of demonstrations for independence.
Chinese authorities have offered a reward of one million yuan ($120,000) for the arrest of those responsible for a bomb set off on Christmas Day outside government offices in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.
No casualties were reported, but the bomb caused widespread damage, shattering windows 100 metres (yards) away, officials have said.
Chinese officials have said there was little doubt the blast was politically motivated and carried out by followers of the the Dalai Lama.
Last week, Tibet's government-in-exile in Dharamsala, in northern India, denied the Chinese allegation, saying the bombing could have been carried out by China as an excuse to crack down on dissent.
Chinese authorities have tightened security across Tibet in the run-up to New Year celebrations next month and vowed to continue a campaign to indoctrinate monks and nuns to be "patriotic" and to pledge allegiance to the Chinese government.

A group of 56 Chinese writers, former officials and academics has petitioned Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin to save cultural relics from the gigantic Three Gorges dam which would flood huge tracts of land.
Ancient tombs and temples were threatened by a dearth of government funds and official under-reporting of those relics that warranted saving, according to the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters on Tuesday.
"The hearts of relic protection departments are like burning fire with 10,000 worries and misgivings," it said of the lack of funds.
About 130 historical sites, some of them dating to the Stone Age, could be flooded as soon as next year.
The sites include Qing dynasty (1644-1911) temples, an entire street from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and stone carvings from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).
Relocation of many relics had been delayed due to lack of funds, the letter said, adding that the damage would worsen unless government funds for relocation were provided.
The letter dated August 8 was signed by prominent female writer Bing Xin, former ambassador to the United States Chai Zemin and former minister of culture Wang Meng.
Others include Su Bingqi, president of the Archaeological Society, and Yu Weichao, curator of the Museum of Chinese History who is in charge of relocating relics.
Archaeologists had designated 829 buried relics near a reservoir under construction as needing protection. The sites covered a total area of more than 20 million square metres (215 million square ft), but the government has agreed to protect one tenth of the area due to a lack of funds, it said.
Some ancient tombs and relics have already disappeared under the onslaught of bulldozers, the letter said.
Construction of the controversial dam was expected to submerge 632 square km (244 square miles) of land in central China's Hubei province and the southwestern province of Sichuan.
It would force the relocation of 840,000 people from up to 200 villages and towns, according to 1991-92 estimates.
Environmentalists have described the project as a potential ecological disaster, leading to the destruction of a scenic mountain region and the extinction of endangered species.
The Three Gorges dam -- the world's biggest water control project --  was expected to ease seasonal flooding by creating a massive reservoir in Hubei to store waters from rains.
The 6,000-km (3,500-mile) Yangtze river -- China's longest -- and its tributaries have triggered floods throughout much of China's history.
The project, expected to cost $30 billion by its completion in 2009, would also help ease China's crippling shortage of electric power.

China has pledged to open its insurance, stock, retail, wholesale and banking sectors to foreign investment as part of a drive for long-delayed entry to the World Trade Organisation.
"From 1997-2000, China is expected to open its insurance and stock market wider to foreign investment," the China Daily said Sunday, quoting Ma Jixian, an official of the State Economic and Trade Commission under the cabinet.
The pledge was contained in a unilateral action plan submitted by China to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the Philippines last month, the newspaper said.
Before the end of the decade, foreign insurers would have access to markets outside Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Ma said without elaborating.
China's insurance market was once virtually monopolised by the state-owned People's Insurance Group but the sector has gradually opened up to domestic as well as foreign competition.
Only three foreign insurers are able to write insurance policies in China, including American International Assurance Co. Ltd, a part of the American International Group Inc.
The others are Japan's Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd and which has a life insurance joint venture with a domestic insurer.
Ma, one of China's representatives at the APEC summit, said foreign stock companies would be allowed to handle A shares, whose availability is still confined to native Chinese. He gave no further details.
Currently, foreign investors are restricted to buying B shares, while Chinese nationals can only buy A shares.
In its action plan, China also pledged to cut its average import tariffs to about 15 percent from the current 23 percent.
The tariffs would be reduced futher in subsequent years, Ma said without going into details.
"A majority of non-tariff measures will have been abolished by 2010 and all those incompatible with World Trade Organisation rules will have been erased by 2020," Ma said.
China has pushed to gain entry to the WTO on the favourable terms of a developing nation, but Western countries, particularly the United States, have insisted its economy is too big for such preferential treatment.
According to the action plan, China would allow foreign banks to open more operational outfits in 24 Chinese cities and launch pilot bases where foreign banks can conduct yuan business, the newspaper said.
In the first decade of the next century, foreign banks would be allowed to expand their presence beyond the current 24 pilot cities and more pilot bases would be available for them to conduct yuan business, it said.
China would let overseas retailers establish more joint venture or cooperative retailing chains in areas beyond the 11 pilot cities currently allowed, the newspaper said.
The liberalisation would cover all provincial capitals and major economic cities by the year 2010, the newspaper said, adding that foreign retailers would be free to open outlets in China by 2020.
Foreign investors would be allowed larger stakes in China's power sector and have greater access to China's river, marine and road transportation if Beijing becomes a member of the WTO, it said.
China would further open its tourism sector, allowing joint venture travel agencies in five cities on an experimental basis over the next three years, the newspaper said.

For Moslems of the Uighur ethnic minority in northwest China, wearing neckties bearing a crescent and a star -- the national emblem of East Turkestan -- could land them in jail. But many young men are proudly defiant.
For Tibetan monks, nuns and civilians, displaying pictures of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, could mean imprisonment. But almost every Tibetan family in the deeply religious Himalayan region of China has one.
Uighurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minority groups tried to resist Chinese rule for decades, but uprisings were crushed and dissent silenced under the late chairman Mao Zedong's iron-fisted rule.
With Beijing loosening its grip slightly in recent years, more Uighurs and Tibetans have dared to speak their minds, and many clamour for independence in defiance of Beijing's attempts to dilute their culture.
An anti-Chinese riot in the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang -- a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan -- this month left nine people dead and 198 wounded, officials said. Police arrested up to 300 people after the riot.
"Minority ethnic groups are like wild horses that are difficult to tame," a government official in Beijing said.
"They could gallop away at any time...regardless of how well fed they are," said the official, speaking anonymously. "Like a centrifugal force, their tendency is to move away.
"Ethnic minorities are an old problem, a big problem and a difficult problem to solve," the official added.
This month's Moslem riot was one of the largest and most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang -- which means New Frontier in Chinese -- since the communist takeover in 1949.
Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by bombings and assassination attempts.
Tibet has been rocked periodically by riots led by Buddhist monks and nuns loyal to the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against the Chinese.
China accuses the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland, of fomenting unrest in Tibet.
Extremities committed during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang and Tibet have contributed to the resolve of ethnic minorities to try to bolt, analysts said.
Han Chinese, who account for more than 90 percent of China's population of 1.2 billion, have been accused of trying to dilute the cultures of Uighurs and Tibetans.
Uighurs were banned from learning their written language in the Cultural Revolution. "It's like hacking them with a knife. They'll never forget the wound," the government official said.
Han Chinese have had more success assimilating other ethnic minorities. The proud Manchus ruled China from 1644 to 1911, but few Manchus can read or write their own language.
A natural divide in looks, lifestyle, language was to blame for much ethnic unrest in more far-flung regions, analysts said.
Uighurs, like their Central Asian cousins, speak Turkic, are Moslems and abstain from pork, a main staple for Han Chinese.
"There's a big difference in the lifestyle, food, language, customs, costume and culture of Han Chinese and Uighurs. These are natural barriers," the official said.
China blames "hostile foreign forces" for much of the ethnic unrest. Kazakhstan is home to many exiled Uighur separatists.
China also has repeatedly accused Western countries of supporting Tibet's Dalai Lama.
"But why are there no disturbances in Inner Mongolia?" one analyst asked in reference to China's northern region, populated mainly by ethnic Mongolians. "That is because Mongolia did not extend its arm into China."

Beijing has pledged to open its doors to imports of U.S. textiles under a new deal, but Washington has no illusions it can close its yawning textile trade gap with China, diplomats said Monday.
Chinese and U.S. negotiators signed a new textile agreement in Beijing on Sunday in an 11th-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and ensured U.S. access to China's textile markets.
"It provides us with an opportunity to increase our access to China's markets in high-priority areas," one U.S. diplomat said. He declined to elaborate.
"(But) we are under no illusions that we are going to balance textiles as a single sector of our trade," said a second diplomat, who requested anonymity.
China exported $6.5 billion worth of textiles to the United States in 1995 but imported only $64 million worth. Diplomats attributed the sluggish U.S. textile exports to Beijing's high tariff rates and non-tariff barriers.
"Textiles are never going to be balanced but it's important that there be a market access element there," the second diplomat said.
The agreement gave China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact, and China pledged to reduce its tariffs on textile imports.
Both the Chinese and U.S. sides declined to say by how much U.S. textile exports to China would increase and vice versa, or by how much China's tariffs would be cut.
"There are significant gains for U.S. industries," a third diplomat said.
"It was, for the first time, a concessionary admission on (the) part of the Chinese that they too had to do something with regard to supplying market access for U.S. products where we were competitive," he said.
The overall U.S. trade deficit with China -- the United States' largest after its deficit with Japan -- was seen reaching $38 billion in 1996, up from $34 billion in 1995, according to U.S. figures.
The new textile agreement may be good news for U.S. textile manufacturers and exporters, but it could be bad news for China's lumbering state enterprises.
A flood of U.S. textile imports could intensify competition and further cripple many of China's state enterprises, almost half of which are in the red, analysts said.
"U.S. textile imports will intensify competition in the already saturated domestic textile market," a Chinese economist said. "Life will be even more difficult for a group of money-losing textile enterprises," said the economist, who asked not to be identified. "Some enterprises will be forced to bow out of the textile industry -- declare bankruptcy or merge."
State-owned textile factories in Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, registered losses of 350 million yuan ($42.2 million) in the first seven months of 1996, the China Business Times said Monday.
The accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade U.S. restrictions on Chinese imports.
China had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks. But it delayed the action to allow time for further talks.
Beijing announced after Sunday's deal that it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but Washington's penalties remained in force.

China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is in good health, but may not be able to visit Hong Kong when the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in mid-1997, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa said on Monday.
"To my knowledge, (his health) is very good," Zhang told reporters when asked about Deng's health at a reception for diplomats and foreign journalists in Beijing.
Zhang, who is believed to be close to the Deng family, said he had not recently visited the 92-year-old architect of China's sweeping economic reforms, but said Deng was in Beijing.
Asked if Deng would visit Hong Kong for the ceremony when Beijing resumes sovereignty over the British colony at midnight on June 30, 1997, Zhang said: "He said it himself -- he will go to Hong Kong even it means in a wheelchair."
But Zhang added: "It would be difficult for him to go now. It would be disastrous for an old man in his 90s to catch cold. Catching cold would be a serious illness."
Deng oversaw the negotiations that successfully concluded in an agreement for Britain to hand back the territory it has held for 150 years. He has said repeatedly he hoped to be able to witness the historic transfer of power.
Chinese officials have said privately that Deng would not attend the handover ceremony, where his anointed successor President Jiang Zemin is expected to hold the limelight, but they hoped he would be able to visit Hong Kong afterwards.
The man who launched China's sweeping market-oriented economic reforms in 1978 and guided the nation's policies during the 1980s and into the early 1990s no longer holds public office but remains highly influential.
He has not been seen in public since early 1994 when he toured Shanghai during Chinese Lunar New Year festivities and appeared frail and halting in his movements and had difficulty speaking.
Deng's health is a matter of intense speculation in China and in neighbouring countries because his death is expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as the de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.
But analysts say that his death has largely been discounted and rumours of his ill-health that just 18 months ago sent Asian markets into a tailspin now generate little more than a murmur.
Deng is said to be suffering from Parkinson's disease. It is believed that he rarely leaves his closely-guarded home in a courtyard in central Beijing just behind the Forbidden City where China's emperors had ruled for centuries. Beijing has clamped an effective blackout on news about the health of the man who guided China out of the years of radical revolution espoused by Mao, dismantled much of 40 years of Stalinist-style central planning and told Chinese that "to get rich is glorious".
Officials routinely decline to answer questions about Deng's health, giving the party line that: "He is as well as can be expected for a man of his age."
However, sources close to the family say Deng is losing his ability to walk and is believed to spend most of his time in a wheelchair.

China is considering restrictions on foreign investment in textiles, garments and sectors where domestic production capacity is already excessive, a senior official of the State Statistical Bureau said on Tuesday.
"The production capacity of some of our traditional industries, such as textiles and garments, is pitifully excessive," Li Qiming, director of the bureau's department of industry and transportation statistics, told Reuters.
"We are currently considering...whether to restrict foreign businessmen from entering sectors in which domestic production capacity is already abundant," Li said. He did not elaborate.
The losses of state enterprises in these industries exceed the national average, Li said but gave no specific figures.
China has said it would curb textile output and unnecessary expansion in the industry in 1997 to reduce losses in the state sector. It has set a target of phasing out obsolete textile equipment, including 10 million cotton spindles.
"There were 429 state textile enterprises that posted losses of more than five million yuan ($602,000) each in 1995. Their combined losses reached 5.21 billion yuan."
"Indigenous enterprises are being squeezed...in some traditional industries," Li told a news conference.
"We may have to consider protection," he said.
The bureau spent one year and mobilised five million pollsters to conduct a survey of industries that showed that foreign investment was concentrated mainly in electronics, telecommunications, textile, garment and food processing, officials said.
China's 10 eastern coastal provinces and provincial-level cities have attracted 87 percent of total foreign investment, while five provinces in northwest China took in less than one percent of foreign investment, Li said.
The survey showed 59,311 wholly foreign-owned and Sino-foreign joint ventures had set up in China by the end of 1995, up 29,343, or 97.9 percent compared with end-1994.
Their combined output value was 1.2 trillion yuan ($144.6 billion) at end-1995, the survey showed. They made profits totalling 79.2 billion and paid 39.8 billion yuan in taxes.
The number of foreign-funded enterprises accounted for 10 percent of the total number of enterprises in China, but the output of foreign firms accounted for 20 percent of the total.
Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen were the biggest investors, accounting for 32.6 percent of the total. It was inevitable that the government would impose restrictions on foreign investment in industries to protect the state sector, analysts said.
About 38 percent of state enterprises registered losses in 1996 compared with the previous year, Li said.
Losses posted by state firms soared 37.53 percent in 1996, he said.
Pre-tax profits of state enterprises slipped 4.83 percent in 1996 while after-tax profits plunged 42.5 percent.
Excessive stockpiles accounted for 20 percent of funds tied up by finished products.
Debts owed among enterprises worsened, with collectibles of state enterprises increasing by 11.8 percent in 1996.

Will the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping plunge the world's most populous country into chaos and division, or will heir apparent Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin take over the reins?
Diplomats and analysts said on Thursday they expected calm before any storm.
Will Deng's anointed successor, who also holds the jobs of state President and head of the armed forces, escape the fate of Chairman Mao Zedong's chosen heir -- a man who survived less than two years when he locked horns with Deng over power?
Will Jiang reverse his mentor's economic reforms and return to Mao Zedong's orthodox communism? Will a power struggle brew behind the scenes among those eager to succeed Deng as China's de facto emperor?
The world will be watching to see which way China's political winds blow -- and how the leadership copes with a plethora of problems from unemployment, a widening gap between rich and poor, corruption and a one-party system.
"I don't think there will be an immediate power struggle," one Western diplomat said on Thursday. "The immediate concern will be to present a face of calm, stability and normality."
Deng died late on Wednesday of respiratory failure -- a complication from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection. He ws 93 by Chinese reckoning, which adds a year to one's age.
His pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.
"There hasn't been such a death in 20 years, of such a prominent figure," another diplomat said.
China would be obsessed with stability and security, but the country could ground to a halt for some time while the nation mourns and leaders jockey for position, analysts said.
"There's going to be a lot more emphasis on stability, more focus on internal security so it's going to be... a cautious leadership," Hong Kong-based Sinologist Tai Ming Cheung said.
"There may be a certain amount of policy paralysis, which has been there already, but beyond that I don't see any great changes," Cheung said. "There is going to be a lull."
One Chinese analyst, who asked not to be identified, said stability would be a facade.
"It'll be like a duck swimming -- on the surface it'll be calm but underneath it'll be turbulent," said the analyst, quoting a Chinese proverb.
Jiang, 70, appears to have consolidated his power base.
But his political rivals, including Qiao Shi, 72, chairman of the National People's Congress, or parliament, were expected to jostle for power in the run-up to a crucial party congress later this year, analysts said.
"I expect an increase in political jockeying," Cheung said.
"I think that Jiang is making all the running and he is in a fairly strong position, so he is the one -- barring any mistakes -- to take full advantage, but then the other people will be pushing just as hard," Cheung said.
Jiang's predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, 77, who was sacked in 1989 as general secretary of the party for showing sympathy to students demonstrating for democracy, is waiting in the wings to stage a political comeback.
Zhao has not been seen in public for more than six years and is believed to be living under house arrest in Beijing.
Most analysts say Jiang is in control, but some write him off as a transitional leader.
"He (Jiang) has been consolidating his power considerably over the last year," the first diplomat said. "He is now less dependent on Deng Xiaoping."

China said on Sunday its soaring stock markets were overheating on widespread speculation and warned of a crash similar to the great Wall Street collapse of 1929.
"Currently, China's stock markets are overheated, making us associate it with the U.S. stock disaster in 1929," the official People's Daily newspaper said in a commentary, issued in advance of its Monday edition by the Xinhua news agency.
China's foreign currency B share market in Shanghai soared by about 80 percent between November 11 and December 10 while the bourse in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen rose by about 100 percent before sharp falls in the final days of last week.
The Shanghai B-share market plunged 12.26 percent on Friday while its Shenzhen counterpart dived 14.75 percent. The Shanghai A-share index lost 5.51 percent and Shenzhen 4.84 percent.
"The stock markets have entered a very abnormal situation fraught with increasing market risk," said the commentary.
Anticipating sharp falls in the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets in response to the article in the People's Daily, which is the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, the commentary said: "The government... will never step in to help the markets when they slump."
The commentary described speculation that the government would support the market against falls because of political considerations before the handover of Hong Kong to Beijing in mid-1997 and the Communist Party congress late next year as "very muddled".
Bank savings were "the safest and most reliable method of investment", it said in an apparent bid to talk down trading.
Last Friday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced that they were imposing a limit of 10 percent on daily movements for stocks with effect from Monday to stop extraordinary price movements.
That move was clearly intended to forestall a possible crash on Monday following the People's Daily policy announcement.
"Recent skyrocketing has been very abnormal and irrational," the commentary said. "We must further check excessive speculation.
"We must strengthen supervision and regulation."
The commentary announced a list of measures to try to rein in the bull run, saying that bank loans, for example, must not be used to speculate in stocks.
The government would increase share issues by listing more profitable medium and large state enterprises, it said.
One factor in the bull run over the past month has been a lack of shares, resulting in a large number of buyers chasing a limited supply of shares.
In addition, market irregularities have been rising this year, the commentary said.
It cited manipulation by big players, bank loans entering the market illegally, overdrafts by brokerages and misleading media reports as among reasons for the skyrocketing of the stock markets in recent weeks.
Last week, securities authorities suspended the rights of two key unidentified newspapers to release official information about listed companies because of "mistakes in reporting".
The Securities Commission announced on Sunday a quota of 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) worth of share issues for 1996. The amount was 200 percent larger than the 1995 quota, Xinhua said.
The quota, if unused by the end of 1996, could be carried over into next year. Xinhua did not specify whether the quota included foreign currency B shares and domestic A shares.

Leading cruise ship operators looking to repeat their success at home by exporting some of American culture abroad will have to tailor their sea-going holidays to local markets and tastes.
Industry executives at an international trade convention said that Europe and Asia could be promising markets for Carnival Corp., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and others in the flourishing North American leisure cruise business, which barely existed three decades ago.
"The major North American lines are well positioned to grow internationally, as long as they acknowledge the major cultural and business differences," P&amp;O/Princess Cruises Chairman Tim Harris said during a panel discussion last week.
North American cruises lines, offering trips to the Caribbean and along the West Coast of the United States to Alaska, are enjoying strong domestic business.
Bookings at Carnival Cruise Lines, the main unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp., are up 37 percent in the three months through last Monday while shipboard berths rose only 13 percent, Canrival Cruise Lines President Robert Dickinson said.
Still another sign of the sector's health in the United States is that Walt Disney Co. will next year make its seawater debut by offering cartoon-themed cruises aboard two new ships from Port Canaveral in central Florida.
The industry is on a ship-building spree, with the just-launched Carnival Destiny capable of carrying 2,600 passengers while Royal Caribbean is building new ships that can carry 3,100 apiece.
But the customers are overwhelmingly from the United States and Canada and the offerings are unmistakably American -- whether aboard mass-marketer Carnival, which describes its increasingly gigantic vessels as fun ships, or other lines catering to richer tastes.
That is not all bad, the executives said, but more offerings tailored to national and regional tastes will likely be required in Asia and Europe.
"The right ships have to go to the right places with the right food," said Celebrity Cruises Inc. President Richard Sasso. Celebrity is an Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. affiliate.
Both Carnival, the industry leader with almost 27 percent of all cruise berths, and number two Royal Caribbean are already active overseas and employ different strategies.
Royal Caribbean competes in Europe but does little beyond hiring multilingual crews to adapt the onboard accomodations, food and entertainment from those it offers on seven-day trips from Miami, company chairman Richard Fain said.
"Our ships offer an American experience in Europe, not a European experience," Fain said. The European tours are aimed mostly at Americans.
"We are carrying more Europeans in the Caribbean than in Europe," Fain said.
Carnival, which expects to carry more than 1 million passengers in 1997, is taking a multi-pronged approach by acquiring the Italian cruise operator Costa and buying into British tour group Airtours Plc.
Carnival also has a joint venture with Hyundai Group of Korea to provide cruise holidays in Asia.
"Those three strategies were deployed to offer products in those markets for people in those markets," Dickinson said.
Harris of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. affiliate P&amp;O/Princess Lines said business arrangements must also be fitted to foreign markets.
Kirk Lanterman, chairman of Carnival affiliate Holland America Line-Westour, said the overseas cruise markets were already substantial.
He said about 3 million people each year take cruises on small lines offering national or "ethnic" foods, entertainment and accommodations and about 500,000 non-Americans travelled on the lines operating from south Florida and elsewhere in North America.
Lanterman also warned his peers against diluting the character of their popular lines.
"It's very difficult to make these ships different for non-Americans without making it unsatisfactory for Americans," Lanterman said.

Any sweeping settlement among state governments and tobacco companies would leave standing a great many anti-smoking suits, including a $5 billion claim scheduled for a June 2 trial, plaintiff lawyers said on Friday.
"It's a lousy settlement for my clients and the American people," said Stanley Rosenblatt, one of two lawyers pressing the Broin class-action suit here on behalf of flight attendants claiming injuries from secondhand tobacco smoke.  
Rosenblatt's case goes to trial on June 2 and is a landmark, because it is both the first class-action suit against cigarette makers to survive preliminary legal challenges and the first trial of a claim of damage from second-hand smoke.
Some 1,000 anti-tobacco lawsuits currently exist in U.S. courts against tobacco companies, according to Richard Daynard of the Tobacco Products Litigation Project at Northeastern University.  
Norwood Wilner, another Florida attorney who secured a $750,000 jury judgment against the Brown &amp; Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries Plc in 1996, has no plans to delay his next trial, said his legal aide, Jenny Stieger.
"We have a trial date of August 4, for another lady with lung cancer," Stieger said.
Wilner on May 5 lost a suit on behalf of smoker Jean Connor, who was killed by lung cancer, against RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.  
Reynolds, the maker of Winston and Salem brand cigarettes, will also be the defendant in the August trial on the claim of Joann Karbinyk, Stieger said.
Another anti-tobacco lawyer, Ronald Acosta, has two tentative trial dates scheduled for summer in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida. Wilner expects to try still another case in November, Stieger said.  
Other cases expected to come to trial in 1997 include another class-action on behalf of Florida smokers in September and a secondhand smoke case in Mississippi brought by the family of a non-smoking barber who allegedly died of cancer caused by the cigarette smokers awaiting haircuts in his shop.
According to published reports, in part challenged by Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, tobacco companies and the 29 state governments suing the industry for billions in healthcare spending on smokers are near a deal limiting the number and type of lawsuits which could be brought by smokers.  
The Wall Street Journal said the proposed terms would make it nearly impossible for future smokers to sue cigarette makers for lung cancer and other common tobacco-related illnesses. "The global settlement is not a done deal," said Stieger. "There is not a whole lot of support for a deal messing with the tort system."
Attorney Rosenblatt said during a pre-trial hearing for the Broin class-action suit that the tobacco industry and the attorneys general would reach a settlement.  Tobacco lawyers would then go to "a friendly court" and ask it to halt the Broin trial.  
"I don't think that's going to be successful, but that's the plan," he said.
Michael Russ, a lawyer for Brown &amp; Williamson, told Reuters as the hearing broke for lunch: "If that is the plan, I don't know about it."

In Miami, the cruise-ship capital of the world, business is bright with bountiful bookings but eyes are warily looking up the Florida coast to where The Walt Disney Co. is readying its sea-going debut.
Essentially landlocked until next year, Disney is the 800-pound gorilla of U.S. holiday-making and currently operates hotels and leading theme parks, such as its Disney World in Orlando. To many in cruising, Disney is already a leading rival for vacation dollars.
Disney, adding attractions in Orlando, Fla., and eager to keep its customers staying with Disney for longer vacations, is indeed offering week-long cruises from Port Canaveral, Fla., on its cartoon-themed ships that include stays at its parks and a visit to a Disney island in the Bahamas.
The company is already taking bookings for April, 1998, and many in the industry see Disney aiding all cruise ships -- and not just the Disney Magic and Disney Wonder due next year -- as Disney broadens a market which draws mainly older customers.
"They are great marketers," Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Chief Financial Officer Richard Glasier said before the industry's recent Seatrade Cruise Shipping Convention here. "They'll open up new aspects of the business."
Disney is renowned for family entertainment and leisure, a segment leading cruise operators courting mass markets want to win, too. An existing cruise service under a third-party licensing agreement with Disney has not had a major role in the cruise market, executives said.
"Disney promotion will add more power in marketing than this has ever seen," said Peter Kowal, general manager of the Cruise Holidays travel-agents chain.
On Wall Street, many worry the industry's ship-building spree is getting ahead of itself and that weak fare pricing evident last year will become chronic. Disney's two ships, weighing 85,000 tons and carrying 1,740 passengers each, will aggravate those worries.
But bookings at Carnival Corp., the industry leader with 26.9 percent of the sector's 116,616 berths worldwide, and No. 2-ranked Royal Caribbean have been very strong this year, even with the addition of many new, very large ships.
"The tone of business is terrific," Glasier told investors last week.
Larger ships, including the just christened Carnival Destiny, the world's biggest at 100,000 tons and 2,600 berths, are much more efficient and much more attractive to vacationers, industry executives said.
A Royal Caribbean ship features a decktop golf course and some big ships have multi-deck atriums. The race to be bigger continues, with Royal Caribbean contracting last year to buy two ships capable of carrying 3,100 people and weighing 130,000 tons. Until this decade, few cruise ships carried more than 1,000 passengers or weighed more than 50,000 tons.
Glasier said Royal Caribbean's big ships generate twice or three times the cash flow of older ships, partly because of higher fares and more on-board shops but also because of cheaper operating costs on a per-passenger basis.
Disney's entry also comes as leisure cruising is consolidating and as the industry tiptoes toward globalization from its North American stronghold. Asia, especially, is seen as a promising market.
"There's a lot of interest in the emerging markets in Asia," Carnival Cruise Lines President Bob Dickinson said.
Outside North America, where trips to Caribbean islands out of Florida and to Alaska from the West Coast are most popular, the markets are relatively small. Europe, the most developed market behind the United States and Canada, is only 20 percent the size of the North American one.
Carnival late last year announced a $300 million acquisition of Costa Crociere SpA, Europe's leading cruise operator, and earlier bought a stake in British tour company Airtours. The company has also reached a joint venture with Hyundai Merchant Marine for an Asia cruise offering.
"We are attempting to source passengers outside the United States," Royal Caribbean's Glasier said.
Royal Caribbean is studying the Asian market and may create a separate brand for the market, Glasier said.
"In Asia, the product should be different. We would probably do that with a different brand," Glasier said.

Tobacco-industry lawyers in the $5 billion Broin secondhand smoke case on Tuesday touched off a testy outburst from the trial judge, who accused them of muddling the minds of prospective jurors with trick questions.
"We pull them apart," Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye told Edward Moss, an attorney for Brown &amp; Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain. "We are playing with their heads."
Kaye, speaking towards the end of a second, slow day of jury selection in the landmark trial, criticised the questions put to jurors by Moss and attorneys for other big tobacco companies such as Philip Morris Cos Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco as too firmly aimed at uncovering anti-smoking attitudes among the prospective jurors.
"You have been playing with people's heads for two days ...," Kaye said.
Kaye said smoking was a widely controversial practice, making it impossible to find a fully neutral jury of six and as many as a dozen alternative jurors to hear the case. Florida law only required that jurors be able to put aside their prejudices and decide on the evidence presented, he said.
Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney for the 60,000 sick flight attendants represented in the Broin class-action suit, said, "These are consumate mind games that are being played by very skilful lawyers. Their problem is that they are looking for people that live in a cave ... uninformed people."
The clash came after the questioning of a young musician who said her voice had been harmed from secondhand smoke while singing in nightclubs. But, under follow-up questioning by Kaye, she said she could set aside her belief that cigarettes should be banned in the United States and decide a verdict just on the evidence presented at the trial.
Kaye refused a tobacco lawyers request that the musician be bumped as prejudiced against cigarette makers but she can be dropped later if the tobacco lawyers choose to use one of 27 juror challenges they may make without explanation.
The woman was just one of six prospective jurors who survived some six hours of courtroom questioning on Tuesday. The other five included an organiser of Miami's annual Orange Bowl parade, a retired police dispatcher and a bookings manager for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. Eleven people have now made past the initial round of attorney queries.
At least a dozen more people are to be questioned on Wednesday, Kaye said.
Earlier, the judge sided with tobacco lawyers who opposed a Rosenblatt request that prospective jurors be questioned in groups, instead of one by one. Kaye said that, while he was eager to get a jury in place, he was worried about possible fallout from news stories on the trial and feared that inflammatory opinions expressed in open court might unfairly influence a verdict.
Individual questioning of potential jurors in the case, known as Broin vs. Philip Morris et al, would continue "so as to not infect the rest of the panel with some dangerous remarks," Kaye ruled.
In the historic case -- the first class action and first secondhand smoke case against the tobacco industry to go to trial -- non-smoking airline flight attendants are suing nine cigarette companies for maladies they claim were caused by smoke from airline passengers' cigarettes.
In the first two days of jury selection prospective jurors expressed widely varying opinions about cigarette smoking.
One said secondhand smoke very likely caused disease in non-smokers while another compared lawsuits against tobacco companies for smoking-related illnesses to suing Kentucky Fried Chicken for Americans' high cholesterol.
Rosenblatt has said he intends to ask for $5 billion or more in damages if tobacco companies are found liable for the lung cancer and other tobacco-related ailments among the flight attendants. Smoking on U.S. passenger jets was banned in 1988.

Liggett Group's pact breaking away from other cigarette makers has failed to shake the confidence of tabacco growers in North Carolina, where the crop has been king for centuries.
"Tobacco farmers will continue to have a market, regardless of the success or failure of the suits," North Carolina State Attorney General Mike Easley said.
Tobacco is North Carolina's single biggest crop and the plant's broad, brown leaves sustain thousands of manufacturing, financial and other jobs.  
"Tobacco supports 200,000 families in North Carolina," said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for state Gov. Jim Hunt.
North Carolina is America's biggest producer of tobacco. Tennessee, Virgina, South Carolina, Kentucky and Georgia are also major tobacco-growing states.
The maker of Chesterfields and L&amp;M branded cigarettes, Liggett last week rocked the tobacco business and Wall Street by agreeing to settle lawsuits with 22 state attorneys general.  
Liggett promised to pay 25 percent of its pre-tax profits for the next quarter century and label its cigarettes as addictive substances. It also agreed to hand over to the attorneys general internal documents which might bolster multi-billion dollar claims against other cigarette makers.
No cigarette company but Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group, has made such a deal. Other cigarette makers, such as Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, fiercely condemned the pact.  
"It'll give everybody something to talk about, but I don't think it will cause any adverse effects in the short term," said William Graham, a retired Farm Credit Services loan officer in Proctorville, in southeastern North Carolina.
"I just don't think people are aware of just how much tax money tobacco generates in this country," Graham said.
"What I want to say is not fit to print," said tobacco grower Grady Britt of Broad Ridge, also in southeastern North Carolina, where tobacco has been a mainstay for more than 200 years.  
Other growers worried that the Liggett pact was another sign that tobacco, also a major export accounting last year for about 20 percent of the U.S. net agricultural trade surplus, was headed for hard times.
"The government's going to take tobacco away from us, but they aren't going to give anything back," said Newberry Mitchell, a grower since the early 1960s.
"All this decision is going to do is give the government more ammunition to classify tobacco as a drug and regulate it," said Erskine Floyd, another grower who lives in Barnesville, North Carolina.
Easley, the North Carolina attorney general, has not filed a lawsuit against cigarette makers and said the settlement on Thursday was less important than it appeared.
He described Liggett, the fifth-ranked cigarette maker with only a sliver of the market, as a minor industry player and said the legal grounding for the lawsuits by the attorneys general was shaky.

Eastman Kodak Co secured only a partial exit from bruising copier wars with a $684 million sale of its copier-marketing and service operations to Britain's Danka Business Systems Plc.
Prompted by chronic financial weakness, highlighted by the fact Kodak's copier sales of $1.8 billion yield only $20 million in annual operating profits, the sale prompted segment leader Xerox Corp to throw down the gauntlet to Danka.
"They're on our turf now and are going to have to chase us to win business," said Xerox executive Gill Hatch.
Hatch predicted the Danka-Kodak deal on Monday would bring pricing pressures to the copier business. "Suffice to say that Danka has been aggressive, and will continue to be aggressive," Hatch said.
According to Danka chief executive Dan Doyle, the acquisition and a 10-year alliance with Kodak will give high-flying Danka a full line of copiers to offer low, middle and upmarket customers around the world.
Kodak is retaining its manufacturing and development operations in copiers, as well as some key technology.
The remaining Kodak businesses will have about $600 million a year in sales, or a third of its former turnover. Danka will be its main customer as the primary distributor of Kodak copiers and printers.
"Danka's growth will be our growth," said Kodak co-chief operating officer Carl Kohrt.
Kohrt predicted Kodak's rump copier businesses would be profitable by the end of 1997 and that the transaction, netting Kodak about $600 million in cash, would be immediately accretive to earnings. The deal should close by December 31.
Analyst Gary Schneider of Bear Stearns said he had hoped Kodak would have quit copiers entirely and will have to prove to Wall Street it can turn around the financial performance of the remaining copier businesses.
"The question is what kind of normalized earnings can you get out of those," he said.
Monday's deal is just the latest bit of corporate trimming at Kodak, which has spun off and sold businesses, generating some $8 billion. The company has in the 1990s exited pharmaceuticals, household goods and chemicals.
The company said last winter it wanted to exit or reposition its copier businesses because its financial performance was subpar and promised little hope for a turnaround as it stood.
Kohrt said the deal with Danka will stimulate sales of Kodak copiers. "What we've really needed is pull-through from the market," he said.
Danka chief executive Dan Doyle said Kodak's strong focus on big customers needing high-volume copiers and services dovetailed with Danka's traditional presence among low and middle-market customers.
News of the deal boosted Danka's American Depositary Receipts, which closed up 6-5/8 at 36-1/2. Kodak closed down 1/2 at 71-3/4.

North Carolina's attorney general on Friday questioned the legal utility of the industry documents Liggett Group has promised to hand over for use against fellow cigarette companies.
Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group, on Thursday agreed as part of a settlement with 22 state governments suing it to deliver internal documents that may help the states press their cases against Philip Morris and others.
"It's hard to see how Liggett Group would give up evidence of criminal behaviour," Easley said.  
Easley has not filed a suit like 22 of his peers seeking compensation for billions of dollars spent by state governments on treating sick smokers. He favors a legislative resolution.
North Carolina is the biggest tobacco-producing state in the country and home to leading manufacturers. Its governor has allied with the tobacco industry in fighting federal limits on marketing cigarettes, especially to young people.  
The contents of the documents has not been made public. And tobacco company lawyers have secured an order barring the delivery until at least March 31, when a North Carolina state judge will hear arguments on whether not the Liggett handover would violate lawyer-client privileges for other companies.
Easley dismissed as "aggressive" remarks by attorneys general announcing the Liggett deal on Thursday that the internal documents would be crucial in proving allegations of a conspiracy among the tobacco companies.
A Liggett promise to pay 25 percent of pre-tax profits for a quarter of a century was worthless, he said, because Liggett has not been profitable in many years.
"It would appear that the (plaintiff) attorneys only wanted to get some papers," Easley said.
Easley backed a bill in the North Carolina legislature that would regulate cigarette marketing to children.
The courtroom battles against the tobacco industry would be resolved only by a sweeping new law from Washington, Easley said.

Philip Morris Cos Inc shareholders on Thursday voted down by a margin of more than nine to one a shareholder proposal that the firm adopt the same standards on marketing to youths outside the United States that it put in place domestically two years ago.
The proposal to extend the limitations to overseas markets was opposed by Philip Morris chief executive Geoffrey Bible and the board of directors.  
"It's absolutely hypocritical for Mr Bible to hail the company's youth access program at home ... and at the same time not apply the same standard anywhere else," said shareholder Edward Sweda, an anti-tobacco activist and a lawyer with the Tobacco Control Resource Center in Boston.
Philip Morris' U.S. program -- Action Against Access -- eliminated mail sales of Marlboro, L&amp;M and other Philip Morris cigarettes and give-aways of cigarettes at public gatherings.  
The company also added warnings against youth sales to its cigarette packs and began lobbying for state laws to force shopkeepers to check for proof of age, Philip Morris spokeswoman Karen Daragan said.
"The intent (of the U.S. program) is to keep sales to places were IDs can be checked," she said.
But shareholder activists noted that this action was limited to the United States and the shareholder proposal cited data showing how effective Philip Morris cigarette advertising was outside the United States.  
It quoted one study saying 95 percent of children in Hong Kong recognized the Marlboro brand name and a World Health Organization forecast that seven million youths who take up smoking in the developing world will die from smoking-related diseases by 2025.
Bible did not speak directly to the proposal at the meeting but Philip Morris said in the company's proxy for the annual meeting that the company has long opposed sales of cigarettes to young people and a single style of marketing was wrong for a global company selling food, beer and tobacco products in 180 nations.
"Your management thinks it makes more sense for the company to continue to take action against youth access in a manner that recognizes the diversity of markets in which the company operates," the company said.
Top tobacco companies are secretly bargaining with anti-tobacco forces on a $300 billion or more deal to resolve much U.S. tobacco litigation and likely sharply reduce the marketing of cigarettes in the United States.

Two words sure to be heard at Thursday's annual shareholder meeting by Philip Morris Cos Inc are "no comment."
Questions about the top tobacco group's role in historic settlement talks that may end in a cigarette-industry payout of $300 billion or more are certain to arise when Chief Executive Geoffrey Bible meets shareholders at Philip Morris' sprawling manufacturing plant in Richmond, Virginia, activists and industry analysts said.

A Miami television journalist who produced a news report on niche-brand cigarettes was knocked from the pool of standby jurors in Florida's $5 billion secondhand smoke trial on Thursday.
The unidentified female television-news producer was among 15 people questioned by judge and lawyers on Wednesday. She said she had produced a television report for Fox station WSVN Channel 7 on cigarette marketing, scheduled for broadcast that evening. Despite tobacco lawyers objections, she was placed in the pool of potential jurors to sit on the trial, expected to last eight weeks or longer.
Tobacco company lawyers again on Thursday asked Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye to remove the freelance news producer, saying her piece negatively portrayed tobacco companies and reflected a bias making her unsuitable to fairly decide whether the defendants are liable for the smoking-related illnesses of 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants.
A tape of the short television report on flashily packaged Black Death, City and other so-called micro-brand cigarettes favored by some young smokers was shown in court and included interviews with shopkeepers, young smokers and a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society.
Stanley Rosenblatt, an attorney pressing the class-action suit, said the television report had been very likely edited by other journalists and did not necessarily reflect the mindset of the news producer.
But Kaye sided with the tobacco lawyers and removed the woman from the standby jurors pool, saying, "The appearance that it was weighted would make it inappropriate for her to be seated."
After four days of jury selection, the standby jurors pool numbers 18. Some 60 are needed to seat a jury of six. A second round of screening will be required to find between six and 12 alternates before testimony can begin in the landmark trial, a court official said.
A nurse, a college student and an immigrant from Mexico were placed in the standby pool on Thursday. People excused by Kaye include a nun who described smoking as a vice and the sure cause of diseases she has seen firsthand as a nurse and several people with schooling or vacation plans fixed firmly during June and July.
Kaye late on Wednesday said he was reconsidering a Rosenblatt request that prospective jurors be questioned in groups as a way of speeding up jury selection. Tobacco company lawyers objected, saying that since smoking and attitudes about secondhand cigarette smoke were hot-buttom matters people had to be questioned separately.
A court official said Kaye would likely decide on group questioning of prospective jurors on Friday or later. Kaye earlier this week refused a similar request from Rosenblatt.
Jury questioning for the trial, the first on secondhand smoke claims, is likely to run through at least mid-June, in part because the jury selection next week will occur only on Monday and Tuesday because of a break for Jewish holidays.

Cathay Pacific and the Hong Kong government's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) are at odds on the reason for delays at Hong Kong's Kai Tak's airport.
Cathay time performance manager Peter Li blames  delays on Cathay's increasingly congested home airport and "air traffic control" - a charge rejected by Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) which told Reuters congestion and not air traffic control was the true cause.
Cathay which is one of the main users of Kai Tak defines a delay as more than 15 minutes after scheduled arrival or departure. Departure delays rose in 1996 rose to 61 percent of flights from Hong Kong compared to 48 percent in 1995 with arrivals similarly affected, Li said in the airlines in-house newspaper.
Cathay does not publish more details on the extent or number of delays.
Other airlines which also fly into Hong Kong are also frustrated by Kai Tak's constraints which cannot be overcome until its new airport at Chek Lap Kok is due to open in 15 months time, industry sources said.
"In addition to these factors we have to fight against constraints such as slot availability, tight crew scheduling, high fleet utilisation, new products, new routes and new engines on new fleet," Li said.
He said action has been taken at both managerial and operational level to meet the on time performance target including reviewing routes to support re-design of better schedules.
CAD said delays are bound to occur when demand exceeds capacity and when aircraft are bunched together. It added the reason for the apparent increase in delays suggested by Cathay's statistics can be explained by the way delays are defined by the airlines. Because Kai Tak has limited apron space, aircraft occasionally have to be held in their parking bays which counts as a delay unlike at other busy airports, the CAD said.
The CAD has been actively reviewing ways of enhancing capacity to handle ever increasing demand, the CAD statement added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

Members of the Orient Airlines Association (OAA) operate the greatest concentration of Boeing 747 cargo aircraft in the world, according to the latest edition of the magazine which covers the association's affairs, Orient Aviation.
In a fleet review of the 16 member airlines - Ansett Australia has just become the 17th - the magazine said the most common aircraft type was the 747. Of the 382 strong 747-fleet 42 are freighters which the magazine said was "the greatest concentration of cargo aircraft in the world."
In all, OAA airlines operate 1,156 aircraft, 69 per cent of which are wide-bodies. The fleet is expected to grow by about 32 per cent by 2001.
The magazine said the average age of OAA aircraft is 7.7 years. Taiwan's EVA Air has the youngest fleet with average aircraft age at 2.3 years. Malaysian Airline System Bhd fleet average is 3.9 years, South Korea's Asiana Airlines is 4.9 and Singapore Airlines is 5.2 years.
Member airlines of the OAA are Air New Zealand, Air Nuigini, All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines, EVA Air, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Malaysian Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Qantas Airways, Royal Brunei Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways International. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

A Hong Kong government aircraft is to be the first to land at the territory's new Chek Lap Kok airport next month, a Civil Aviation Department spokesman told Reuters.
A Beechcraft Super King 200, belonging to the Government Flying Service, and normally used for search and rescue missions, is due to make the maiden landing on February 20, the spokesman said.
Initial reports said two American pilots flying a U.S. government Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) jet used to test the new airport's navigation instruments would be the first to land on the newly completed 3,800 metre long and sixty metres wide southern runway.
But for "ceremonial" reasons the spokesman said the honour will be given to Hong Kong government pilots watched by invited guests and the media.
"The first landing will be an important milestone in the airport's history," the spokesman said.
After the first flight, the specialised FAA aircraft is expected to start a test and calibration programme of the new airport's Instrument Landing System and navigation aids to prepare for the airport's opening in April next year, the spokesman added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44-171-542-5017

Several European airlines have removed a fuel cargo surcharge but plan to replace it with an increase in their published rates, industry sources told Reuters.
The removal has been made by nearly all the airlines who originally imposed it and comes after a warning from the Hong Kong government that surcharges cannot be imposed nor rates lifted without government approval.
To add to what observers say is a confusing situation, one of the territory's biggest carriers - Lufthansa Cargo - said it is not withdrawing the surcharge. The airline's general manager in Hong Kong, Frank Berweger, said he does not think a surcharge is illegal.
"We still believe that it is legal. We are showing on the airway bill that there is an extra charge which will be dropped when the price of fuel comes down again. We are still in discussion with the CAD about what happens next," Berweger said.
The 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo surcharge was informally agreed by some carriers earlier this month to compensate for jet fuel prices which they said had leapt by around 50 per cent between July and October.
The Hong Kong Shippers' Council, an umbrella organisation representing trade bodies, freight forwarders and business leaders, protested to the Government that any surcharge is illegal unless it is first approved by the Civil Aviation Department.
A department spokeswoman said they had investigated the issue and sent a warning letter to airlines reminding them that permission to impose a surcharge must be obtained first.
Alitalia, KLM, Martinair and Cargolux said they quickly heeded the warning.
"We have withdrawn the surcharge after the warning. Instead we are putting up our rate to compensate for the much higher cost of fuel," said a spokesman for Alitalia cargo in Hong Kong. No details of such an increase have yet been published.
A spokesman for Dutch cargo airline Martinair said it would abide by the proper procedure and also withdraw the surcharge. But he said rates may be increased to compensate.
A Cargolux spokesman said the situation was confusing but it had agreed to also withdraw the surcharge.
Hong Kong Shippers' Council Executive Director Clement Yeung said he was pleased the surcharge had been mainly withdrawn but the situation is "certainly confusing."
"Some airlines are sticking to their guns but we believe that they should go by the book. Imposing surcharges sets a precedent which we do not want to see. If airlines now want to raise their published rates instead then we cannot complain about that," Yeung said.

The Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents (HAFFA) is to raise some of its freight charges from January 1, HAFFA chairman Sam Chung has told Reuters.
But he said the majority of rates, including handling and documentation, terminal charges and attendance fees will not increase.
"HAFFA's goal is to keep freight costs down in order to maintain Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading air freight centre. We raised tariffs this year only on essential, mainly labour intensive items. Although Hong Kong's overall economic situation remains good, salaries and overheads have escalated substantially and the increases in selected rates are necessary in order to keep pace with this," Chung said.
HAFFA said there will be a 6.2 percent increase in air freight flat pack cartage charges to HK$1.40 per kg. Devanning charges will rise by 3.5 percent to 29.5 cents per kg. Container field station loading and unloading charges will rise by 6.7 percent to HK$160 per consignment.

British Airways World Cargo plans to increase its wet lease freighter service between Hong Kong and London to a daily frequency when the territory's new airport opens next year, the airline's area manager for Greater China, Chris Chan, has told Reuters.
BA is also planning to step up its three times a week freighter link from Hong Kong to London Gatwick to four times weekly later this year, Chan said in an interview.
It now operates Boeing 747-200 freighters wet leased from Atlas Air in addition to sizeable belly capacity aboard 14 Boeing 747-400 passenger flights a week to Heathrow.
Wet leasing involves the supply of an aircraft with crew, fuel, supplies and supporting services.
The proposed daily freighter service from Hong Kong could be switched to Heathrow where BA is building a new dedicated terminal provided suitable slots become available, Chan added.
"We are hoping to start the fourth weekly frequency late this summer and a daily service from next year as we continue to expand. Three years ago we started with zero now we have three freighters a week with the prospect of more to come," Chan said.
BA said it currently enjoys a 12 percent market share of shipments from Hong Kong to Europe and 45 per cent to the UK and Ireland.

HONG KONG, Dec 10 (Reuter) Polar Air Cargo is cutting the number of freighters it operates from Hong Kong to the U.S. until the end of the month as the trans-Pacific market is now winding down after a busy peak season, the all cargo airline's Hong Kong sales manager, David Sung.
From Monday December 16, Polar will only operate one or two Boeing 747 freighters to the U.S. east coast, instead of its usual five flights per week.
Sung told Reuters in an interview ex-Hong Kong trans Pacific rates are also reducing at the rate of five U.S. cents per week until the end of the month as demand for cargo space falls because most goods have already reached the U.S. Christmas market.
"For every week after the end of November we see an 8-10 percent drop in demand as the market steps down from the peak period. We will be adjusting our schedule from next week and reducing the number of flights from five to one or two until the end of the month. Recently all our flights have been full - the best peak period for the past five years in Hong Kong - but now demand is dropping off," he said. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017

Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd (HACTL) is considering marketing its knowhow to developing airports around the world, managing director Anthony Charter told Reuters.
During a visit to Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok(CLK) Charter said HACTL may diversify by marketing its expertise built up over the past 20 years.
It may also start to license its sophisticated air cargo handling software, he added.
Industry sources said HACTL is acknowledged to be one of the world leaders in operating air cargo handling facilities and that Kai Tak, already the second largest for international airfreight, is also one of the most efficient.
HACTL may also be interested in becoming a joint venture partner, Charter added.
"Now we are in the execution phase of the new cargo terminal (at CLK) we are beginning slowly to have planning resources with experience available. When we have the time, I think we may start considering marketing services to other airports. Bangkok is obviously one where it would be interesting to be involved," Charter said.
The marketing venture -- possibly a separate unit within HACTL to work on individual projects -- could become a highly profitable offshoot, he added.
"I think we have perhaps been too reticent about marketing our product and we will certainly be looking into it and exploring the idea," Charter said.
Up to now, HACTL planners have been establishing and fine tuning its existing twin terminals at Kai Tak airport. The planning team has also been busy designing HACTLs HK$7.8 billion state of the art SuperTerminal 1 at CLK.
This has a a design capacity of 2.6 million tonnes a year of air cargo and the company says it will be the largest and most advanced facility of its kind in the world when it comes into service in 1998. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel + 44-171-542-7706 Fax +44-171-542-5017

The regional manager for Air France Cargo, Philippe Bour said he will meet Hong Kong government officials on Monday to explain why some leading airlines are refusing to withdraw a fuel surcharge on ex-HK air cargo.
The imposition by airlines of an 80 Hong Kong cents a kilo fuel surcharge has caused controversy in the territory. Following complaints from the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, which also represents freight forwarders, the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) wrote warning letters asking airlines to withdraw the surcharge. Some did but Bour said Air France, Lufthansa Cargo, Swissair, Air Hong Kong and Thai Airways International have refused.
He told Reuters, " we are fighting with the CAD because they are saying it is totally illegal, but we don't have the same point of view. I am saying it is not a rate increase but a fuel surcharge, which is something totally different. I understand perfectly well that we are not allowed to increase the official rate without referring to the CAD, but when are talking about market rate plus a fuel surcharge we are still far below the official rate. We can play around with the market rates and the fuel surcharge will remain," Bour explained.
The average rate from Hong Kong to Europe is between HK$23-24 per kilo with a fuel surcharge of 80 HK cents or 10 US cents which restores the rate to last year's level, Bour said. He said the fuel surcharge is not a blanket application, express cargo and cargo with airway bills containing the published rate is exempt.
Bour said the argument had been referred to the French civil aviation department, which has been in touch with the Hong Kong government.
"Hopefully the meeting on Monday will clarify things and will be a fruitful one," Bour added. - Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+544 171 542 5017

Humana Inc. reported lower quarterly profits Tuesday, mainly due to charges for restructuring, but the stock in the big health maintenance organization rose on optimism over its new president's ambitious turnaround plan.
The 4.9-million member HMO -- fifth largest in the United States among for-profit HMOs -- posted fourth-quarter net income of $22 million, or 13 cents a share, after charges, down from $49 million, or 30 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter.
Quarterly premium revenues were $1.81 billion, up from $1.49 billion in the year-ago period.
For the full year, Humana said net income plunged 94 percent to $12 million, or 7 cents a share, from $190 million, or $1.17 a share. The company reported revenues of $6.7 billion, up from $4.6 billion in 1995.
The stock of the Louisville, Ky.-based Humana rose 37.5 cents to $18.75 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $19.25.
"What the stock is responding to is Humana's outlining a pretty aggressive action plan. ... They're making the organization more lean and mean," said Gary Frazier, a health care industry analyst with the Bear Sterns brokerage.
When Gregory Wolf became president of Humana in September, he took over a company that once had led the managed health care industry, but had more recently seen its star fade as it expanded into unprofitable areas.
Wolf had previously been president of Emphesys Financial Group Inc., which Humana acquired in October 1995.
With the help of a new executive staff, Wolf is pushing through a tough plan to cut costs and withdraw Humana from money-losing markets.
"He's made some very intelligent moves," said Ed Keaney, health-care industry analyst with the Volpe Welty brokerage.
In the fourth quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $10 million after taxes related mainly to severance costs for elimination of 700 to 900 jobs this year from its roughly 18,000-member work force.
The company has sold or is selling money-losing operations in Alabama, Washington, D.C., and other markets.
In the second quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $130 million after taxes to restructure the Washington health plan, provide for expected insurance losses, close 13 service areas and discontinue unprofitable products in three markets.
As a result, the company said total enrollment in its commercial health care plans fell by 69,100 members last year, by 87,500 members in January alone and is expected to decline by 115,000 members this quarter.
"Our plans to withdraw from certain markets and price business commensurate with the underlying risk are proceeding on schedule," Wolf said.
The company's medical-loss ratio -- a key measure of profitability -- improved to 82.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 83.1 percent in the third quarter, but was up from 81.5 percent in the year-ago period.
Analysts said they were impressed with Wolf's plan for reversing Humana's fortunes but noted the company unveiled a turnaround plan once before that was never fully achieved.
"I want to see a little more of a turn in earnings before I'm sure this action plan is taking hold," Frazier said.

The boards of RightChoice Managed Care Inc and parent Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri are moving to calm relations with regulators, return to profitability and ensure company control is firmly in the hands of chief executive John O'Rourke.
The three-pronged strategy was highlighted Tuesday when the boards said talks about a possible combination of RightChoice and BJC Health Systems had been halted, putting an end to a project conceived and launched last year by two top executives who were fired on Wednesday.  
In an interview with Reuters, O'Rourke said the talks with BJC -- a St. Louis hospital organization -- were called off primarily for business reasons.
"It was clear as we proceeded in the discussion with BJC that the kind of deal that was being considered...would not be acceptable to the national Blue Cross association," he said.
But he added that the boards of RightChoice and the Missouri Blues meant to show their support for him as well.
"The other part of the decision was...a vote of confidence in the company and in the management team that had just been hired to direct the company," he said.  
RightChoice expects to return to profitability later this year.
"We're really projecting, at least at this point in time, that we will return to profitability by the third or fourth quarter," he said.
The St. Louis-based company lost $3.7 million on revenues of $170.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $4.9 million on revenues of $154.6 million a year earlier. Wall Street registered its disapproval of the announcement of the halted BJC talks by driving shares in RightChoice down 3-1/2 to close Tuesday at 13-3/8.  
On the day of the management shake-up, O'Rourke was in the office of Missouri Department of Insurance director Jay Angoff with an offer to make peace, he said.
In May 1996, the Missouri Blues sued Angoff seeking a declaratory judgment that all applicable laws had been followed in the 1994 restructuring creating RightChoice.
The Blues also sought a permanent injunction barring the department from taking certain actions against the company.
In August, the department blocked a proposed share transaction in which RightChoice would have purchased 1.5 to 2.0 million of its own shares from the Blues.  
Then on December 31, a Missouri judge ruled the Blues had "abused or exceeded their legal authority" in undertaking the reorganization that created RightChoice three years earlier.
Heimburger vowed to fight the court ruling. Meanwhile, under his watch, RightChoice lost money in its third and fourth fiscal quarters.
In February, O'Rourke was named chairman and chief executive of RightChoice, replacing Heimburger. O'Rourke had previously been president and chief executive of HealthLink Inc, which RightChoice acquired in 1995.
"I have a mandate from the board to...improve the profitability of the company, to improve the public image and to address our regulatory issues," O'Rourke said.
The Missouri Blues' appeal of the December 31 court ruling is still pending and the share transaction proposal remains on hold, O'Rourke said.

Option Care Inc is comfortable with a Wall Street 1997 earnings estimate of $0.41 per share, compared to $0.33 per share before a one-time charge in 1996, said chief executive Erick Hanson.
In an interview with Reuters, Hanson said the Bannockburn, Ill.-based home healthcare company is targeting annual revenue growth of 25 to 30 percent. "We have a pretty good pipeline and a plan to be able to achieve that," he said.
The company's thinly traded shares were unchanged at 5-5/8 late Wednesday. Management owns 70 percent of the stock.  
Started in California as a home infusion services franchiser, Option Care was bought in 1991 by healthcare entrepreneur and venture capitalist John Kapoor, who took it public the following year. Kapoor remains chairman and owns 60 percent of the company. Hanson came aboard two years ago.
Option Care and its franchisees operate 190 facilities in 39 states, with heavy concentrations in California, Georgia, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
Home healthcare firms sell services and products to people with cancer, AIDS and other medical disorders requiring intravenous drug treatment or other relatively complex care.  
As the managed care revolution has driven more patients out of expensive hospital beds, home healthcare has emerged as a hot industry. Nursing home companies, hospitals, HMOs and others are rushing to get into it, chiefly by acquiring home healthcare specialty firms such as Option Care.
Amidst this rapid consolidation, Option Care stands out as the largest remaining pure play in the market for home infusion therapy, or intravenous medication administration.
The company is diversifying into related home healthcare businesses, however, so that it will eventually resemble more broadly based home healthcare firms, Hanson said.  
Large, diversified competitors include Apria Healthcare Group Inc and Olsten Corp, Hanson said.
Option Care is going about its transition by acquiring its better home infusion franchises and smaller independent firms, as well as home nursing agencies, medical equipment sellers and respiratory therapy service providers. Option Care did 12 acquisitions in 1996 -- five franchises, seven independents.
"Our strategy is to buy strong franchises in targeted regions, then surround them with complementary services through acquisitions," Hanson said. "Our objective is to be fully integrated by the end of 1999 in at least seven states."  
"What we're saying is that with one phone call, one stop, we can provide any type of home care," Hanson said.
Option Care recently received a $30 million credit line from a group of banks. "We're investigating during the next 12 to 18 months the possibility of putting more equity in play," Hanson said, adding that Kapoor is "very much open to reducing his position, but he also doesn't want to walk away from it because he thinks it's a good place for his money."

Polaris Industries Inc., best known for its snowmobiles, said Wednesday it will begin building motorcycles, riding its small-engine expertise into a market no major U.S. company other than Harley-Davidson Inc. has dared test in 40 years.
Minneapolis-based Polaris said it is developing a highway cruiser motorcycle that will be named Victory and be available to consumers in the spring of 1998.
"We've built pretty much all of it from scratch. The engine was designed in the USA and it's going to be made in the USA," said Matt Parks, who will be general manager of the new Polaris motorcycles unit.
Polaris is the world's largest maker of snowmobiles and is among the world's top three makers of all-terrain vehicles, or ATVs, and personal watercraft.
"We've competed successfully against Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Suzuki in our other businesses. ... Entering the motorcycle market is a logical extension of our diversification strategy," said Polaris Chief Executive Officer Hall Wendel.
Shares in Polaris rose 37.5 cents to $26.25 on the New York Stock Exchange trading.
Besides the legendary Harley-Davidson, there are only two other, much smaller U.S. motorcycle makers -- Salt Lake City-based ATK America Inc., a maker of specialised off-road machines, and Buell Motorcycle Co., which is 49 percent owned by Milwaukee-based Harley and also located in Wisconsin.
Polaris said its new cruiser will compete with Harley's machines, as well as similar bikes from Honda and others. The company declined to disclose price or design specifications.
"It seems there is a market opportunity," said Beth Burnson, an industry analyst at the ABN-AMRO Chicago Corp brokerage and investment bank here.
In recent years, Harley has been unable to make enough cruiser motorcycles to meet booming demand, leaving a hole in the market, Burnson said.
"Japanese companies have been able come up with Harley copycats that people will buy off the showroom floor if they don't want to wait two years for a Harley. That's the part of the market that Polaris can target," Burnson said.
Polaris said it expects its existing customers -- an estimated 30 percent of whom are motorcyclists already -- will be among early buyers. The worldwide market for cruiser motorcycles is estimated at over 200,000 units annually, and sales of cruiser motorcycles have nearly doubled in the last five years, Polaris said.
With personal watercraft sales expected to slump this year due to overstocking in 1996, and snowmobile sales flat, Polaris has relied for growth recently on strong ATV sales, said Scott Ciccarelli, an analyst at the Gerard Klauer Mattison brokerage and investment bank in New York.
Challenging Harley, against which it has never competed, may be tough for Polaris, but moving into motorcycles is a logical next step for the company, he said.
"They've been hinting toward this for the last two years or so," Ciccarelli said.
Engines for Polaris products are presently built in-house or by Japan's Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., which makes Subaru-brand cars, or by a Fuji-Polaris joint venture, Robin Manufacturing, in Hudson, Wis.
Engines for the new motorcycles will be built at the Polaris engine plant in Osceola, Wis., and the motorcycles will be manufactured at the company's Spirit Lake, Iowa, plant, the company said.
On Feb. 4, Polaris reported 1996 sales of $1.19 billion, up 7 percent from $1.11 billion in 1995. Annual profits were $62.3 million, up 2 percent over the previous year. Polaris said it expected 1997 sales to decline from the 1996 level but still show another year of record-setting profits.
"Expenses related to the development of the company's motorcycles are reflected in its expectations for 1997 net income in excess of 1996's record level," Polaris said.

Quaker Oats Co. conceded defeat Thursday in efforts to turn around its struggling Snapple beverage unit and agreed to sell it for $300 million -- $1.4 billion less than it paid for the business -- to Triarc Cos. Inc., the owner of rival Mistic beverages.
The selling price -- far below the $1.7 billion Quaker paid for the premium beverage company in 1994 -- disappointed Wall Street, but analysts said they were pleased that Quaker did the deal.
"It was a fire sale price ... The bad news is the investment has been a disaster, the good news is they're trying to put it behind them," said John McMillin, a food industry analyst at Prudential Securities, a brokerage and investment bank.
Snapple's ready-to-drink teas and juices virtually invented the premium soft drink market and remain a leader, with more than $500 million in 1996 sales. But Snapple has lost money ever since Chicago-based Quaker -- better known for its breakfast cereals and Gatorade sports drinks -- bought it.
Snapple sales fell 8 percent in the United States and Canada in 1996, the company reported last month.
"The decision to sell Snapple was reached after an extensive review of various shareholder value-building options by management," said Quaker Chairman William Smithburg in a statement.
"After reviewing all possible options, we decided it was in the shareholders' interest to remove the financial burdens and risks Snapple brought to the portfolio and better focus on our value-driving businesses," Smithburg said.
New York-based Triarc, the buyer, owns the Mistic drinks business, a Snapple rival. It also owns Royal Crown soft drinks, Arby's Inc. fast-food restaurants and other businesses.
"With respect to Triarc, this transaction is very positive ... it is complementary to Triarc's existing position in Mistic, which is fruit juices, while Snapple is mostly teas," said Michael Branca, a food industry analyst at Lehman Brothers, a brokerage and investment bank.
"In addition, Triarc's beverage management is highly respected in the beverage distribution business ... Snapple could well be reborn under Triarc," Branca said.
Following announcement of the deal, Quaker's stock rose 87.5 cents to $38.375 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Triarc rose $1.50 to $17.25.
Quaker said it would take a non-cash pretax charge of about $1.4 billion, or $8.40 a share, in its first quarter, to record the loss on the sale.
The company also said it would be able to recoup about $250 million in taxes paid on previous capital gains, "making the cash value of the transaction approximately $550 million."
A Quaker spokesman said the tax consideration was a key part of the company's decision to sell Snapple to Triarc now.
The spokesman added that Triarc, which could not immediately be reached, has indicated it intends to transfer virtually all Snapple employees with the business.
Triarc said in a statement it expected to close the deal by the end of June, subject to customary conditions, including government antitrust clearance.
Besides Snapple, Quaker's other products include Gatorade, which continues to dominate the sports drink market, and cereals, such as Quaker oatmeals, Cap'n Crunch and Life.
"Quaker still has the crown jewels -- Gatorade and the cereals -- and performance in those businesses has been pretty good," said food industry analyst George Staphos of the investment bank and brokerage of PaineWebber.
Quaker said that as a result of the sale, its earnings -- excluding the one-time loss -- were expected to increase by about 10 cents a share in 1997 as debt is reduced and Snapple losses removed.
For all of 1996, Quaker earned $248 million, or $1.80 a share, on revenues of $5.2 billion.
"The monkey is finally off Quaker Oats' back," said John O'Neil, food industry analyst at BT Securities.

Troubled auto lender Mercury Finance Co. said Thursday it won an extension of its short-term credit line with Bank of America, but analysts said permanent refinancing remains Mercury's most critical need.
"The trick will be to get some permanent financing in place and then get the thing up and running again," said James Inglis, financial services analyst at Philo Smith &amp; Co.
Extension of the $50 million, short-term loan is still a major advance, said Mercury Chief Executive William Brandt.
Mercury's creditors granted waivers allowing extension of its credit line with Bank of America to June 10. The waivers permit Mercury to continue to pledge assets as collateral on the $50 million credit facility. The previous waiver period had been for only 30 days, Chicago-based Mercury said.
"This 90 day extension is a tangible demonstration of confidence in Mercury," Brandt said in a statement. "The expanded waiver period gives the company breathing room to focus on operations and on the exploration of long-term financing alternatives."
The company said it is talking with holders of $22 million of subordinated debt about their interest payments.
Mercury faces a federal investigation and several shareholder lawsuits after its January announcement that it had to restate financial results to show lower profits due to accounting irregularities.
The company lost more than $2 billion in market capitalisation after its stock price plunged on the news of the restatement. The stock fell in January from $14 to less than $2 per share. It rose 25 cents to $2.875 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Under the terms of the waivers, during the 90-day period, Mercury will resume interest payments on nearly all of its roughly $1 billion in debt and will pay any past-due interest.
Mercury received the $50 million in short-term financing from Bank of America a month ago. It is being used to meet daily operating expenses and interest payments.
The 90-day extension is "certainly a good sign," said Katrina Blecher, financial analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co. "I don't think it was unexpected," she said. "But they have to get permanent financing. My gut says they'll probably be able to do it. I would certainly would not write the company off."

St. Jude Medical Inc's proposed $505 million stock acquisition of Ventritex Inc will likely proceed, said chief financial officer Stephen Wilson.
In an interview Thursday with Reuters, Wilson discussed the company's duty to look into the three recent deaths of patients implanted with Ventritex medical devices.
But he said that, as serious as the deaths are, "It's not the kind of thing that results in St. Jude Medical not wanting to move forward with the transaction."
Shares in St. Jude were up 3/8 to 36-7/8.  
"So many good things have been put in place and we did work very hard and very long to make that happen. It really would be, in my view, very unfortunate if this transaction didn't move forward," he said.
Ventritex last week confirmed the death of a third recipient of one of its implantable defibrillators, devices that regulate heartbeat. Wilson gave Ventritex high marks on handling the problem so far and said St. Jude intends to get a full understanding of the situation.
"What we don't think makes any sense is for us to be breathing over their backs," Wilson said.  
He declined to comment on Wall Street speculation that the transaction price might be renegotiated down.
"Clearly, we do need to go in and do some due diligence so that we understand whether or not there has been any impact on the franchise value," he said.
He estimated that federal regulatory review of the deal may take another three to four weeks.
"In the best set of circumstances, at this point, we might get a first-quarter closing. If not, then hopefully we get an early second-quarter closing," he said.
Shares in Ventritex were up one to 19.  
Concerning St. Jude's additional analysis of the impact on the deal of the deaths, Wilson said: "One of the things that we'll do is talk to some of the physician customers out there to see how they feel about the way it was handled. Then, most importantly, how they feel about Ventritex and its products moving forward. That's the real key question."
He said St. Jude has not set a date to start additional due diligence, but is in close contact with Ventritex. He added that St. Jude expects to see sales of more than $1 billion in 1997.
"Even without Ventritex, we will exceed $1 billion," Wilson said.

BBI Healthcare Corp, the company to be formed by the merger of Bergen Brunswig Corp and Ivax Corp, will target earnings growth of 15 percent or more and return on equity of 15 percent or better, said Bergen chief financial officer Neil Dimick.
"At a minimum, our objective would be to grow earnings at greater than 15 percent," Dimick said at an investors conference here Tuesday held by the Raymond James brokerage and investment bank.  
The Bergen-Ivax merger is proceeding as planned, said Bergen chief executive Donald Roden.
Orange, Calif.-based Bergen is the largest U.S. distributor of generic drugs, while Miami-based Ivax is a generic drug manufacturing giant.
The two agreed in November to a stock-for-stock merger in which Ivax shareholders will get 0.42 shares of BBI for each Ivax share, and Bergen shareholders will get one share of BBI for each Bergen share. After the merger, BBI will be about 56 percent owned by Ivax shareholders and the remainder by Bergen shareholders, the companies said.  
Roden will be BBI chief executive. Ivax chief executive Phillip Frost and Bergen chief executive Robert Martini will be co-chairmen of BBI, while Dimick will be BBI chief financial officer, the companies said.
BBI will be a vertically integrated company handling generic drugs and other healthcare products from the research lab, through production and distribution, the companies said.
Bergen also announced Tuesday that it has developed an electronic, on-line catalog and historical purchasing database service for generic drugs and healthcare products. "Catalog users will have instant access to more than 300,000 products offered by any and all of our subsidiaries," Roden said.
The on-line service will make purchasing data going back 24 months available via computer, Bergen said.
The electronic catalog is scheduled to be delivered to customers in June, Bergen said.

Humana Inc. reported lower quarterly profits Tuesday, mainly due to charges for restructuring, but the stock in the big health maintenance organisation rose on optimism over its new president's ambitious turnaround plan.
The 4.9-million member HMO -- fifth largest in the United States among for-profit HMOs -- posted fourth-quarter net income of $22 million, or 13 cents a share, after charges, down from $49 million, or 30 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter.
Quarterly premium revenues were $1.81 billion, up from $1.49 billion in the year-ago period.
For the full year, Humana said net income plunged 94 percent to $12 million, or 7 cents a share, from $190 million, or $1.17 a share. The company reported revenues of $6.7 billion, up from $4.6 billion in 1995.
The stock of the Louisville, Ky.-based Humana rose 37.5 cents to $18.75 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $19.25.
"What the stock is responding to is Humana's outlining a pretty aggressive action plan. ... They're making the organisation more lean and mean," said Gary Frazier, a health care industry analyst with the Bear Sterns brokerage.
When Gregory Wolf became president of Humana in September, he took over a company that once had led the managed health care industry, but had more recently seen its star fade as it expanded into unprofitable areas.
Wolf had previously been president of Emphesys Financial Group Inc., which Humana acquired in October 1995.
With the help of a new executive staff, Wolf is pushing through a tough plan to cut costs and withdraw Humana from money-losing markets.
"He's made some very intelligent moves," said Ed Keaney, health-care industry analyst with the Volpe Welty brokerage.
In the fourth quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $10 million after taxes related mainly to severance costs for elimination of 700 to 900 jobs this year from its roughly 18,000-member work force.
The company has sold or is selling money-losing operations in Alabama, Washington, D.C., and other markets.
In the second quarter, Humana took a special charge against earnings of $130 million after taxes to restructure the Washington health plan, provide for expected insurance losses, close 13 service areas and discontinue unprofitable products in three markets.
As a result, the company said total enrollment in its commercial health care plans fell by 69,100 members last year, by 87,500 members in January alone and is expected to decline by 115,000 members this quarter.
"Our plans to withdraw from certain markets and price business commensurate with the underlying risk are proceeding on schedule," Wolf said.
The company's medical-loss ratio -- a key measure of profitability -- improved to 82.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 83.1 percent in the third quarter, but was up from 81.5 percent in the year-ago period.
Analysts said they were impressed with Wolf's plan for reversing Humana's fortunes but noted the company unveiled a turnaround plan once before that was never fully achieved.
"I want to see a little more of a turn in earnings before I'm sure this action plan is taking hold," Frazier said.

In reply to a report issued last week by two Wall Street drug industry analysts, Eli Lilly and Co said it is unaware of physicians having problems switching schizophrenia patients from older treatments to Lilly's new antipsychotic drug, Zyprexa.
"We are not hearing anything from our prescribing physicians, sales representatives or clinical investigators that would indicate a problem upgrading patients to Zyprexa," said Lilly vice president Gary Tollefson. "On the contrary, Zyprexa prescriptions, including refills, continue to grow."  
Shares in the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturing giant closed down 2-1/2 to 86-5/8 Thursday, extending a week of choppy declines from a 52-week high of 95 on February 24.
Fahnestock &amp; Co analysts Louis Webb and Irena Djurovich issued a report February 26 that said physicians are having trouble switching patients to Zyprexa and that expectations for the drug's sales potential may be inflated.
A follow-up report on February 28, issued after the analysts talked with Lilly, said the Zyprexa switching problems persisted. Contacted Thursday, Webb said, "We stand by our original report."  
The February 26 report said, "The Director of Ambulatory Services for Outpatient Psychiatry for Bellevue Hospital in New York City expressed to us that about a third of his patients that were switched to Zyprexa from Risperdal and other antipsychotics had experienced a return of psychotic symptoms." Risperdal is a competing anti-schizophrenia drug made by New Jersey-based Johnson &amp; Johnson.
The March 3 Lilly rebuttal quoted Dr. David Nardacci, Director of Ambulatory Services for Outpatient Psychiatry at Bellevue, saying, "As a practicing clinician, it is not customary for me to communicate with the analyst community."  
He said, "I was never told the results of my conversations were to be for publication. I take exception to the one-third figure italicized in the report and would like to state that for patients with prominent negative symptoms or severe EPS (extrapyramidal symptom) histories, Zyprexa should be considered alongside Risperdal as a first-line agent."
Nardacci could not immediately be reached.
Zyprexa was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for U.S. sale in October, setting off a contest for market share between Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Abbott Laboratories Inc, Zeneca Group Plc and Pfizer Inc are expected to join the fray soon with new drugs.
Estimates of the size of the U.S. schizophrenia drug market vary widely, ranging from $1 billion to $4.5 billion, with about 2.5 million Americans suffering from the disorder.
Risperdal and Zyprexa, both fairly new, are already competing against older medications, including generically available haloperidol and Sandoz AG's Clozaril.

Talks about Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc joining a grand telecoms alliance spanning the United States, France and Germany highlights the urgency with which companies are jostling to plug gaps in their global reach.
France Telecom said on Wednesday it was in talks with the British group about C&amp;W joining Global One, one of three main world partnerships racing to offer lucrative communications services to multinational firms.
"There are talks with Cable and Wireless and they centre on whether the company can become the British partner for Global One," chairman Michel Bon said.
The disclosure was spurred by a report that Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc was mulling a potential $15 billion bid for America's Sprint Corp that was quickly knocked down by Sprint and its partner France Telecom.
The Wall Street Journal reported that C&amp;W had held talks with France Telecom, which along with Deutsche Telekom AG owns 10 percent of Sprint, about supporting a bid.
Sprint noted that a hostile takeover by Cable and Wireless and France Telecom was impossible because of standstill agreements with its European partners under which their stakes in the U.S. group cannot be increased without its permission.
Analysts have been tipping a closer alliance between the two groups for months, although most believe a link-up will be sealed by Global One taking a stake in C&amp;W's cable venture, Cable and Wireless Communications.
U.S. telecoms giant AT &amp; T Corp has formed a loosely-knit alliance called Unisource/World Partners, and British Telecommunications Plc has formed Concert Plc with its U.S. partner MCI Communications Corp .
A record merger and acquisition boom has been predicted in the $800 billion world telecoms industry, spurred by tumbling trade barriers as the domestic revenues of telecoms firms are squeezed by increasingly tough competition.
Analysts predict that world trade liberalisation, spurred by international treaties, will lead to the formation of mega-carriers that will try to capture the entire traffic of multinational firms with offices in the U.S., Europe and the Far East.
A deal between Concert and Spain's Telefonica  to create a formidable telephone network spanning the Americas may be announced this week, industry sources said on Wednesday.
America and Britain, which have led the liberalisation of world telecom markets, are setting the pace for mergers.
In the last 12 months, mergers have run to tens of billions of dollars as carriers such as MFS WorldCom , BT and MCI, Bell Atlantic and NYNEX and SBC and Pacific Telesis announced merger plans.
But the big mergers are also starting to show the strain of coordinating global management.
Some analysts warn that although C&amp;W, with its attractive asset bases in Britain and Asia, is probably one of the most sought-after telecom partners, it is not a "natural bedfellow" with France Telecom.
"Commercially speaking, there's a huge amount of tension within Global One," said Paul Staples, head of the telecoms team at merchant bank Schroders.
Staples thinks only the political will of the French and German governments is keeping Global One together in its current form.
"I'm in the camp that says I'd be surprised if Global One was in its current form in two years time," he said.
The group has not resolved the issue of what to do in markets outside France, Germany or the U.S. and are often bumping up against each other in Asia Pacific, pursuing potentially conflicting investment strategies.
Unlike BT and MCI's Concert alliance that aims to offer seamless services to corporate customers, Global One's partners do not see their alliance as an investment vehicle to extend coverage, he noted.
"They see it as a standardised marketing agreement," he said.
France Telecom is also embroiled in a partial privatisation at home and needs a period of stability before embarking on big, new ventures.
"The market will not tolerate France Telecom senior management going off on a frolic of their own," Staples said.
Institutions are looking for the company to concentrate first on its domestic customers and running an efficient business, he said.

U.S. local telecoms company Ameritech Corp said on Friday that it was in merger or acquisition talks with several European security monitoring firms worth $200-$500 million each.
"There are some serious negotiations going on," Ameritech's international affairs director Dennis LaComb told Reuters.
Chicago-based Ameritech hopes to double its current $4.0 billion European investments over the next few years, said LaComb, who was in London until Saturday on a "courtesy visit".
"The majority of our investment internationally is in Europe. This is a very important area for us," he said.
Over the past six years, the so-called "Baby Bell" -- which was spun off from U.S. telecoms giant AT &amp; T Corp in 1983 -- has taken stakes in privatisations abroad in countries such as Hungary and New Zealand. The group has what it calls a conservative approach of "focused and disciplined" investment.
LaComb said that security monitoring -- such as using telephone lines to link up customers' home alarm systems to police stations -- was also a natural business direction for the $31.3 billion telecoms group to take.
Ameritech, which is facing its first taste of competition in its local market in the U.S. upper Midwest, is America's second biggest security monitoring group and hopes to become the pan-European market leader.
The first deals are likely to be struck in Germany and France, although the company said it was also looking at firms in Scandinavia and was considering Britain.
Some analysts warn that competition in the local U.S. phone markets coupled with a regulatory delay in allowing Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), or "Baby Bells", to branch out into the long distance American market does not bode well for shareholder value.
As long distance and other telecoms rivals invade RBOCs' territories and fat margins, brokers such as Salomon Brothers see the former monopolies losing at least 30 percent of their market where they used to earn 45-50 percent cash flow margins. These could fall to 35 percent, they say.
Unlike some of its sister Baby Bells, Ameritech has no current designs on becoming a global telecoms player.
Instead, it wants to focus its international strategy on regional telecoms, communications such as alarm systems and exporting its knowledge of customer services and of operating in competitive markets to telecoms firms, such as Portugal Telecom SA, that are standing on the privatisation launchpad.
Ameritech's European ventures so far include stakes in Telecom Corporation of New Zealand, a local, long distance and cellular phone and satellite television service provider, Poland's Polska Telefonia Komorkowa and Norway's NetCom GSM, two cellular telephone operators.
It has partnered with Deutsche Telekom AG to take a stake in Hungary's incumbent Matav Rt telecoms operator and also holds a stake in Belgacom, the Belgium national operator.
International investments also include a joint venture in China's regional cellular operator ChinaCom.

One 2 One, the British mobile telephone company jointly-owned by Cable and Wireless Plc and U S West Inc, said on Thursday that it was not in talks about joining Cable and Wireless Communications.
Analysts have speculated that the digital cellular company may join CWC, Britain's biggest telephone and television cable company formed by the merger of C&amp;W's Mercury 'phone unit with the three British cable divisions of NYNEX Corp, Bell Cablemedia Plc.
Such a deal would involve U S West selling its 50 percent stake in One 2 One, because the U.S. company is also a major shareholder in CWC's main cable rival -- Telewest Communications Plc.
But One 2 One's managing director Jan Peters told reporters at a business briefing: "There are no plans to do that and no negotiations to do that."
Peters said both investors were "very committed" to One 2 One, adding that the cellular company could reap synergies from striking distribution, marketing and packaging deals with both CWC and Telewest, which would not involve any structural changes to the companies.
Other future joint deals might also involve CWC or Telewest buying airtime from One 2 One and using it for their own packages and brands.
"We're working with both of them, looking at the options," Peters said.
One 2 One -- which has shown marked recovery from a lack of network coverage and what critics described as poor marketing -- was unveiling four, new customer packages designed to expand its business by broadening its appeal.
Available from June 3, the new "time plan" deals -- called One 2 Weekend, One 2 30, One 2 100 and One 2 200 -- offer either up to 200 minutes of free voice, fax or data calls nationally or unlimited free weekend local calls.
Monthly service charges from 17.50 stg for One 2 Weekend to 40 stg for One 2 200 compare favourably with similar packages offered by rivals Cellnet Orange Plc and Vodafone Group Plc.
But Peters said the new launches were not part of a new price war in an increasingly competitive market, but rather a move to improve packaging to reduce customer confusion amid a myriad of different package offerings.
One 2 One, one of Britain's newest cellular operators that was launched in September 1993, has won 620,000 customers and captured around 8.8 percent of the national mobile market.
The company, which has doubled year-on-year growth and revenues, said key annualised revenues per subscriber were tracking rivals at around 420 stg compared to Orange's 442 stg, Cellnet's 474 stg and Vodafone's 542.
Total capital expenditure of 970 million stg is planned to March 1998 and national coverage should be boosted from a current 85 percent to 95 percent of the population by the end of this year.
One 2 One's losses widenden to 276 million stg last year as it rolled out its network. But the company said it was on track to break-even on the operating cash level in 1998.

British Telecommunications Plc said on Thursday it might launch a legal challenge if a windfall tax on its profits was imposed by Britain's new Labour government.
Reporting a rise in annual pretax profits to 3.2 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) from 3.02 billion, chairman Sir Iain Vallance said the group owed it to its shareholders to try and prevent the government taxing its earnings. BT shares were up two pence at 1120 GMT to 451-1/2p.
"If we are stung in a big way for this tax and if it can be challenged legally, we owe it to our shareholders to challenge it," Vallance told BBC radio.
But he added the company would be "very sad" to start a partnership with Labour, elected on May 1, on such a footing.
The government said it would impose a one-off windfall tax on what it calls the "excess profits" of privatised utilities, whose large executive salaries and surging dividend payments to shareholders have enraged consumer groups into alleging consumers have been short-changed.
Labour has declined to identify the companies it plans to target. But some analysts said BT could be hit with a one-off tax of 1.0-1.5 billion pounds.
Vallance said it would be "perverse" to line up BT with privatised utilities, which include many electricity and water companies, for punishment. But he said BT would not pull out of its "superhighway" agreement, whereby it would provide free computer services to schools and hospitals in return for an early release from a ban on using its main network for broadcasting.
"We're not a monopoly, not a utility, heavily regulated, have very low call charges, an excellent customer service record, we're very important for the UK in getting jobs in the information society that we're in at the moment and therefore why tax us?" he asked.
From its menial beginnings as a Post Office appendage, BT has grown meteorically into a formidable telecoms giant whose network of alliances span most of the globe.
BT on Wednesday won approval from European regulators for its proposed merger with its American partner MCI Communications Corp -- the biggest transatlantic merger in history.
The $20 billion deal will create a new company called Concert Plc and only faces one more hurdle -- U.S. regulators. Approval is expected by the autumn.
Finance director Robert Brace told Reuters that BT and MCI's Concert Communications, which provides innovative global services to high-margin, multinational clients, was set to break even this financial year.
He said the business was "clearly" ahead of its two loss-making rivals, the Global One partnership between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint Corp and the Unisource/World Partners alliances headed by America's AT&amp;T Corp.
"We've got a backlog of orders of $1.5 billion, the customers love it, it's growing fast," he said. "It's the start of big improved services for multinationals around the world..."
Concert, whose last gap in its geographical coverage remains Asia, boasts business from around 3,500 customers in 41 countries with annual revenues of around $500 million.
Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers, said Concert appeared to be the best positioned global carrier in a rapidly consolidating global telecoms industry.
But he warned that 50 percent of BT's revenues and 66 percent of its profits depended on its domestic business.
BT, which raised total dividends 6.l percent to 19.85p, said despite fierce price competition, it was increasing its market share in Britain amid a strong growth in demand for its products and services, while keeping a tight control on prices.
But inland telephone call turnover was virtually unchanged at 4.874 billion pounds.
BT said price cuts in the year amounted to more than 800 million pounds -- nearly six percent of its 14.9 billion pound turnover.
A strengthening pound also hit BT's international call sales. Together with a 14 percent price cut in the year, international turnover fell 8.6 percent, BT said. ($ = 0.608 British Pounds)

Forget applets, baud rates and java. Computer experts say they don't matter -- not without cryptography.
With new technology fuelling an explosive growth in communication over the Internet, companies are looking to cash in on developing codes so tough they will render information unintelligible.
Cryptography -- encoding data, establishing its authenticity and preventing its undetected modification and unauthorised use -- is seen as the key to the future of the booming virtual business world.
But throw in terms, abbreviations and acronyms such as TTPs (trusted third parties), LEAKs (law enforcement access to keys), key escrow, key recovery and algorithms -- and confusion reigns.
"I've been working in this industry for four years and I don't know what some of the terms mean," complained a member of the high-powered audience at the snappily-named "Encryption Feasibility Summit" in London last month.
INTERNET MARKET DRIVES ECONOMIC GROWTH
Nearly 200 million people expect to be connected over the Internet in the next few years.
Investment bankers Takumo Amano and Robert Blohm say the Internet market is the single most important factor behind the strength of the United States economy.
They estimate that as business on the Internet met demand for software, hardware products and communications lines, it contributed some $200 billion, or roughly three percent, to last year's U.S. gross domestic product.
But while everyone agrees that it is vital to encourage electronic commerce by allowing secure transactions across international borders, law enforcers and the business community stand diametrically opposed on how to do it.
REGULATION DEBATE
Should encryption, which hides data from both computer-hacking corporate rivals and the police, be regulated? And if so, how?
"There are two approaches," says David Hendon, the British government's Internet regulation expert at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
"One is the fear that strong encryption will become available on the Internet. The other is the fear that it will not become available on the Internet."
The drawn-out debate has spawned new creatures -- cryptoanarchists (those wanting no controls on cryptography), cryptofascists (those wanting total government control) and the middle-of-the-roaders -- crytoconservatives and cryptoliberals (those believing in some controls).
IS NATIONAL SECURITY AT RISK?
While companies say they need to keep transactions over the Internet secret, governments are reluctant to accept technology that, for the first time, might make legally intercepted messages unreadable.
What is not at issue is whether cryptography, like a spell checker, will soon be available on all software. It will.
The issue is how impenetrable it should be and whether state security agencies should have access to the keys, or algorithms, that can unscramble codes.
Codes come in various "bits" -- or key lengths. The longer the "bit", the tougher the code is to crack.
While companies say they won't do business over the Internet unless they can use the toughest security available, governments are afraid that such codes will prevent them from uncovering crimes ranging from international guerrilla warfare to child pornography.
THE AMERICAN ANSWER
The U.S. government bans top U.S. software firms, like Netscape Communications Corp, from exporting their toughest 128-bit encryption technology.
To the outrage of companies, U.S. export laws permit only ready exports of not more than 40-bit keys for all but a narrow category of products for financial transactions.
"Too many consumers have heard about successful computer hackers. Without strong encryption, electronic commerce cannot advance beyond where it is today -- a nascent industry with less than approximately $500 million in total sales," says Netscape.
THE BRITISH SUGGESTION
In Britain, a consultation paper on cryptography regulation suggests licensing trusted third parties -- those firms offering cryptographic services to the public.
To qualify for a licence, companies might have to store copies of the keys that decode their users' private files so that law enforcers, and some private parties, can intercept communications under certain circumstances.
Critics complain that they no longer understand the definition of trusted third parties. "It seems to have changed from who the user trusts to who the government trusts," noted one speaker at the encryption conference.
Another added: "I'm beginning to wonder whether there is a third party I can trust to tell me which third party to trust."
Encryption is not new. A range of technologies designed to encrypt data that is stored and transmitted in cyberspace has been used by military and diplomatic governmental bodies for years.
Although some companies already encrypt internal electronic information, the technology has not been open to full, international commerce.
INTO THE REALM OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
With multinational, lawful access to electronic data also at stake without multinational policies, international bodies such as the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have muscled in on negotiations that are moving in the direction of international law.
After a year of talks with more than 100 government and business representatives, the OECD has called on countries to avoid creating unjustified obstacles to trade in the name of cryptography policy.
Publishing eight, non-binding, recommendations, the 29-country group did not rule out giving governments access to keys to unlock encrypted material. But it also suggested that the right to privacy should be respected.
General Motors, the world's biggest car maker operating in 170 countries and employing 745,000 staff, is calling for prompt multinational agreements that will allow it to choose its own encryption requirements which will be legal in all the countries in which it operates.
"If we fail here, it is going to have devastating economic consequences for us," says James Dunn, a representative of General Motors International Operations.

Telecoms analysts in London were amused on Monday by Portugal Telecom SA's gaffe in stating that Telefonica de Espana SA had linked up with America's MCI Communications Corp.
Despite Telefonica's denials that a deal had been signed with MCI, the partner of British Telecommunications Plc, most analysts expect a four-way alliance to be announced and said such a deal was already reflected in BT's share price.
BT announced earlier that its Concert venture with MCI was forming a strategic partnership with Portugal Telecom but declined to comment on whether a similar deal had been struck with Telefonica's international arm Tisa.
"I'd say it's a bit of an 'oops' situation and someone has probably got egg on their face," laughed one analyst.
Another noted: "It looks to me a bit like a cock-up for Portugal Telecom." But he added: "It is becoming obvious that the four are going foward together. It should be good news."
Apart from winning exposure to Brazil through today's alliance with Portugal Telecom, Concert has little direct presence in other South American countries.
But a deal with Telefonica's international arm Tisa will add the rest -- the booming markets of Peru, Argentian, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and Puerto Rico -- to its growing geographic portfolio.
John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at SocGen, said he would welcome a deal with both Iberian partners because it would "close the door" for Concert on the Americas. MCI is already the second largest carrier of international telephone traffic from the U.S. to Latin America.
Because few expect Telefonica to be able to remain in its current alliance in Europe, AT&amp;T -led Unisource, while joining arch-rival Concert in Latin America, analysts expect Telefonica to abandon Unisource.
Without Telefonica, analysts said Unisource would be severely weakened and this could force AT&amp;T to rethink its European strategy.
"The benefit for Concert of joining forces with Telefonica is that they weaken AT&amp;T while at the same time strengthening themselves," Tysoe said.
"The more people join in Concert, the less attractive AT&amp;T's option is," he added.
Another analyst noted that Telefonica had always been understood to want to be on the side of Portugal Telecom "so that they don't need to fear that Portugal Telecom will invade Spain and vice versa".
The analyst, who declined to be named, added that he had expected BT and MCI to take a five percent stake in Portugal Telecom, rather than the 1.5 percent holding they had agreed on.
"You could argue they are now spending their money more wisely and they are not going to invest that much in Portugal Telecom because they need money elsewhere," he noted.
Although few believe that Telefonica will allow a partner to buy a stake in Tisa, BT is expected to try to break into the booming Asian markets. Analysts say BT is in talks with most strong players, including the likes of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.
While global telecoms alliances such as Concert fall over themselves trying to plug holes in their geographic portfolios and make up for the growth lost in more mature markets, some analysts warn that not all strategic investments will be successful.
"Overall, it is more important to look at the core business which, for Concert, is the U.S. and UK -- and there, prices will only go one way -- down," said the analyst. "Volumes will presumably also not continue to grow as healthily as they are growing at the moment.
"Perhaps not in the next week or two, but certainly within 1997, people will be much more sober," he warned.
BT's transatlatic roadshows should pay off on Tuesday when shareholders are expected to approve the group's planned 12.3 billion pound ($20 billion) merger with MCI.
Analysts then expect the group to stop what one called "its marketing machine" and start concentrating again on its operations.

Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC), Britain's biggest and newest cable telephone and television group will float a 14.7 percent stake in London and New York early next week.
The flotation, which is not big enough to propel the new company into the FTSE, has been expected since CWC was formed in 1996 by merging the Mercury unit of Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc with the three British cable TV units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada.
The recommended offer for shares in CWC, which has been valued by analysts at an average of around 4.5 billion pounds ($7.3 billion), closed on Friday at 1330 GMT and experts expect trading to start on Monday at 1330 GMT.
No confirmation of the level of acceptances was expected before 1600 GMT, but the offer was recommended and over 65 percent of shareholders accepted the deal when CWC's complex prospectus was issued in March.
Richard Brown, the incoming chairman of CWC and chief executive of Cable and Wireless, says the company will be customer-led and market-driven and has promised a flotation immediately after the offer closes.
After the merger, there will be only one brand name  -- Cable and Wireless -- and a huge advertising campaign is planned ensure the name wins public recognition.
With assets worth about 4.5 billion pounds, CWC will provide a broad range of local, national and international voice and data services and, in some regions, multichannel TV and internet computer services.
Despite bringing together cable TV groups NYNEX CableComms, Bell Cablemedia Plc and Videotron, CWC's core business will be the telephony provided by Mercury. It will be British Telecommunications's main rival.
But with initially only 1.1 million residential telecom and 80,000 business customers compared to BT's 20.5 million residential and about seven million business clients, some analysts say the new company will only pose a serious threat to BT in the middle of the next Century.
"I don't see CWC as a threat (to BT) in the short and medium term," said Oliver Ehrenberg, telecoms anlayst at Robert Flemming.
Initially, around 91 percent of revenues will be derived from telecoms and only nine percent from TV entertainment, although this is expected to grow.
The company hopes to be the first to roll out its 200-channel service ahead of its rivals, which include satellite broadcaster BSkyB, possibly by autumn.
CWC plans to complete its broadband cable and local telephony networks by investing some 110 million pounds over two years and offer services to more than six million residential customers by 2001.
It also wants to serve almost all small and medium-sized businesses within its 45 cable franchise areas.
Another 180 million pounds will be spent over the same period on so-called set top boxes, with which customers can receive multi-channel television services.
But with 2.3 billion pounds of capital expenditure in the first two years and initial net debt of 1.3 billion pounds, Ehrenberg does not expect investors to receive a dividend before 2001 at the earliest.
Cable and Wireless, which will have a 52.6 percent stake in CWC, wants to remain a majority shareholder and has said it will consider boosting its investment if partners back out.
NYNEX and Bell Canada, which are facing increasing competition at home, have not so far seen great returns for their investments in Britain's stagnant cable market.
France Telecom says it has held talks with Cable and Wireless about CWC becoming the British partner of its Global One alliance with Deutsche Telekom AG and America's Sprint Corp.
Analysts note that if Global One wants to link up with CWC, it is more likely to convince the North Americans to sell out rather than chase a small amount of shares in the open market next week -- which could become expensive.
CWC had pro forma revenues of 1.9 billion pounds with net income of 44 million pounds in the year to March 1996.

British Telecommunications Plc flexed its muscles on Thursday, saying it would not hesitate to launch a legal challenge to any government windfall tax on its profits.
Reporting a rise in annual pretax profits to 3.2 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) from 3.02 billion, chairman Sir Iain Vallance said the group owed it to its investors to attempt to fight any Labour plans to tax its earnings.
"If we are stung in a big way for this tax and if it can be challenged legally, we owe it to our shareholders to challenge it," Vallance told BBC radio.
But he added the company would be "very sad" to start a partnership with Labour, which swept to power on May 1 for the first time in 18 years, on such a footing.
"I would not have voted Labour had (a windfall tax on BT) been in the manifesto," Vallance told reporters.
The government says it will levy a one-off tax on what it calls the "excess profits" of privatised utilities, whose large executive salaries and surging dividend payments to shareholders have enraged consumer groups.
Labour, which wants to raise money to help get the young and long-term unemployed back to work, declines to identify the firms it plans to target and BT's comments found favour with another potential target -- BAA.
The British airports operator is taking legal advice and accused Labour of "verging on irresponsibility" by not detailing who would be hit.
Unlike water and electricity companies, which are resigned to the tax, BT's Vallance charged that it would be "perverse" to line up BT with utilities for punishment.
"We're not a monopoly, not a utility, heavily regulated, have very low call charges, an excellent customer service record, we're very important for the UK in getting jobs in the information society that we're in at the moment and therefore why tax us?" he asked.
But he said BT would not pull out of its "superhighway" agreement with Labour, whereby it will wire up for free schools and hospitals. It is hoping for an early release from a ban on using its main network for broadcasting.
While BT was in a fighting mood, it also threw a challenge to its industry regulator Oftel. BT accuses Oftel of suggesting "unduly harsh" curbs on the prices BT charges rivals for carrying calls on its network.
Oftel has published a consultation paper suggesting that a basket of so-called "interconnect" prices should fall between 6-12 percent below the rate of inflation.
But finance director Robert Brace told reporters that even the lower end of this range was too harsh -- on top of a one-off price cut of 10-20 percent -- and would harm infrastructure investment in Britain.
"In extremis, we would be prepared to challenge it (the price regime) at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission," he said, adding that interconnect charges in Britain were about one third of those in other countries.
Thursday's results from BT, which left its shares barely changed at 450.5p, are likely to be its last in its current form.
Once its ambitious $20 billion merger with its American partner MCI Communications Corp is cleared by U.S. regulators, a new company called Concert Plc, will be floated in London and New York.
BT on Wednesday won approval from European regulators for what is the biggest transatlantic merger in history.
With final approval expected in autumn, Concert will be the second biggest company in terms market value on the London stock exchange.
Andrew Harrington, analyst at Salomon Brothers, says Concert appears to be the best positioned global carrier in a rapidly consolidating telecoms industry.
But he warns that 50 percent of BT's revenues and 66 percent of its profits depend on an increasingly competitive domestic business.
BT, which raised total dividends 6.l percent to 19.85p, said despite fierce price wars it was increasing its domestic market share amid a strong growth in demand for its products and services.
But price cuts in the year came to 840 million pounds -- nearly six percent of its 14.9 billion pound turnover.
BT maintained its inland call volume growth at seven percent although annual international call volume growth slipped a touch -- also to seven percent.
A strengthening pound also hit BT's international call sales. Together with a 14 percent price cut in the year, international turnover fell 8.6 percent, BT said. ($ = 0.608 British Pounds)

M.A.I.D Plc, Britain's electronic business news and data service, said on Thursday it was poised to announce fresh deals to expand its reach while also promising profitability in 1997.
Dan Wagner, founder and chief executive, said in an interview that having tied up International Business Machines Corp, Thorn Business Communications, Nokia Ab, Oy and CompuServe Corp, M.A.I.D was in final discussions with more partners.
"You can expect more substantial, global alliances to be tied up within the next few months that we've been working on for quite some time," he said.
Wagner said new partners were likely to be telecoms groups, major publishing groups and online companies that would allow M.A.I.D, whose corporate customer base trebled to 3,800, to reach more business people.
The company sent its shares jumping in relief after fourth quarter and annual figures pointed to a turnaround of the group's fortunes.
Annual pretax losses came in at 7.03 million pounds ($11.2 million) compared to 4.05 million in the previous year, but fourth quarter losses narrowed sharply.
"All the sceptics out there are already cooking their hats," crowed Wagner.
By 1100 GMT, the shares had jumped 16p to 188-1/2.
"We have now stabilised our costs against the background of continued increasing revenues in both the core business and through alliance relationships," Chairman Michael Mander said in the results statement.
"We are well positioned for profitable growth in 1997 and beyond."
Pointing to "phenomenal" customer growth, even in the highly-competitive U.S. online market, Wagner said MAID was placing markers in all areas needed to build a long-term position in the future of electronic publishing.
M.A.I.D has already partnered with the South China Morning Post, the top English language newspaper with about 93 percent of news-stand sales in Hong Kong and with iafrica.com, the leading South African internet service provider, to expand the business in Africa and Asia.
About 70 percent of services offered by M.A.I.D are based on research data.
But the group also provides real-time news with its LiveWire services, which allows users to be alerted to pre-selected, requested headlines as they appear.
Personalised access to 27 live newswires, ranging from the British regulatory stock exchange wire to U.S. news agency Associated Press, costs 150 pounds per month for 20 desks, Wagner said.
This sharply undercuts similar services from news and information services Reuters Holdings Plc and Bloomberg, he said, although the product is aimed at individual business people rather than trading rooms.
The deal with Nokia allows clients to access share price and foreign exchange information on hand-held devises and the Thorn deal allows high-speed access to the Internet computer network from hotel rooms.
M.A.I.D says that because its electronic services are mainly research, rather than news, it is not threatened by companies providing news directly on the Internet.
"Ours is a supermarket of intelligence," Wagner said. "News is one element our of brokerage research, country and economic research, market research, company research.
"The threat of the Internet is non-existent, the opportunity is enormous."

Cable and Wireless Communications, Britain's new cable giant, said on Monday it might seek further acquisitions as it set the formal stage for its complex formation and partial flotation.
Releasing 36 pages of detailed documents slightly ahead of schedule, new chief executive Graham Wallace said the merger of four cable telephone and television companies announced in October offered a unique range of products and services.
Nevertheless, the new company, which plans to list 14.7 percent of its shares in London and New York in the next few weeks, might go back on the acquisition trail.
"Here we've formed the (UK's) largest cable company, so we've taken the first step in the consolidation of the industry -- and we'll look at other acquisitions as and when they will arrive," Wallace said during a telephone conference call with journalists.
But he added: "We have a scale and mass here that gives us a significant advantage. We certainly don't need to be any larger."
Valued at between 4.0 and 7.0 billion pounds ($11.2 billion) by analysts, the merger brings together Cable and Wireless's Mercury subsidiary and the British cable television units of NYNEX Corp and Bell Canada's Bell Cablemedia Plc and Videotron.
The new company, which will serve about 1.2 million telephony and 580,000 cable TV customers, will provide a broad range of local, national and international voice and data services, and in certain regions, multichannel television and internet computer services.
It hopes to complete its broadband cable and local telephony networks by investing some 110 million pounds over two years and offer services to more than six million residential customers. It also wants to serve almost all small and medium-sized businesses within its 45 cable franchise areas.
The group will spend another 180 million pounds over the same period on so-called set top box, with which customers can receive multi channel television services.
It hopes to launch a formidable attack on the dominance of British Telecommunications Plc in telephony. Regulatory restrictions prevent BT from offering broadcasting services.
The formal offers from Cable and Wireless Communications to shareholders of the merger partners were launched on Monday as well as financial details of the company. Bell Cablemedia promptly recommended that its shareholders accept the offer.
Cable and Wireless Communications' pro forma revenues for the year to March 31, 1996, were 1.90 billion pounds with net income of 44 million pounds.
Since the merger was announced, talk has mounted that a global telecoms alliance such as the Global One partnership of Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint Corp might take a stake in the venture.
With 14.7 percent of Cable and Wireless Communications (C&amp;WC) due to be floated in London and New York, the next few weeks will provide new shareholders with the opportunity to join the group -- or give old partners a chance to leave.
Newspapers have tipped Bell Canada as being a likely candidate to sell what will be a 14.2 percent stake and end its exposure to the Britain's stagnant cable market.
But Wallace declined to comment on alliance speculation or Bell Canada's (BCM) long-term strategic plans, saying only: "(BCM) is very happy with the investment that it has in C&amp;WC as far as we are aware."
France Telecom confirmed last week that it was in talks with Cable and Wireless about the cable venture becoming the British partner of the Global One alliance.
Wallace said Cable and Wireless, which will have a 52.6 percent stake in the new company, wanted to remain a majority shareholder and would consider further investment of its own if its current partners backed out.
Britain will be C&amp;WC's short-term focus, But Wallace said the group is also eyeing continental Europe.
Analysts are keenly awaiting the partial float so that the market can value the business which has assets worth 4.5 billion pounds.
The first closing date for the offers is April 25. The listings will immediately follow completion.
Under the terms of the offer, each Bell Cablemedia (BCM) ordinary share receives 0.69389 C&amp;WC ordinary shares.
The offer for NYNEX CableComms shareholders includes a deal of 0.330714 C&amp;WC ordinary shares for each NYNEX CableComms UK ordinary share.
Around 65 percent of BCM and 67 percent of NYNEX shareholders have said they would accept the offer. ($ = 0.623 British Pounds)

The rapidly evolving market for stored-value cards could be hurt by premature government regulation, one of the top U.S. bank regulators said in a report issued Wednesday.
An array of companies, including banks, credit card networks and others, are trying to popularize stored value or "smart" cards that carry electronic currency. But the cards have yet to catch on with consumers.
Federal Reserve Board, which regulates banks and runs the payment system used to tranfer hundreds of billions of dollars a day among financial institutions, evaluated possible regulation of smart cards under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.
"Early regulation of electronic stored-value products could cause higher regulatory costs than later regulation," the Fed said in its report. Regulations could be costly for smart card providers and might arbitrarily favor one type of product over another, the Fed said.
"Given the limited experience with stored value products to date, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the benefits to consumers from any particular Regulation E provision would outweigh the corresponding costs of compliance," the report noted.
Regulation E sets out the Fed's rules for electronic funds transfers, including protecting consumers against fraudulent or mistaken transfers.
Sen Bob Bennett, chairman of the Senate banking Committee's subcommittee on financial services and technology who criticized an initial Fed plan to regulate smart cards, welcomed the report.
"For the first time, the Federal Reserve has carefully considered the cost of action as well as the potential cost of inaction with regard to the implementation of new regulations on the fledgling stored-value card industry," the Utah Republican said.
Last April, the Fed had proposed applying some parts of the funds transfer act to smart cards. But Bennett and others in Congress opposed that move and passed legislation requiring a report before any action was taken.
Early regulation could have some benefits, however, the Fed said. Government rules have "the potential to speed up development by promoting standardization and by removing uncertainty."
In any event, the market will probably grow slowly, the Fed predicted. "Widespread public acceptance of stored-value products, if it occurs at all, will likely develop slowly over many years," the report said. "Their introduction seems unlikely to change the fundamental nature of our current payment system in the near future."
David Jung, senior analyst at the market research firm Killen &amp; Associates, agreed. "We expect solid growth of about 25 percent a year but we don't see any break-out yet," Jung said.
Volume of smart card transaction is expected to grow from under one billion transactions this year to about 10 billion worldwide in 2001, Jung said.
Fairly soon, smart cards could be used to pay for everything from parking meters to magazines published on the Internet, Jung said.

There will be many more places to hang your hat in cyberspace soon, thanks to a plan adopted by the Internet Society and a host of other groups, the society announced Tuesday.
The group, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, said the plan would provide seven new top-level domains, the last three letters at the end of every electronic mail or Web site address.
Computer maker Digital Equipment Corp., telecommunications company MCI Communications Corp. and UUNET Technologies Inc., a unit of Worldcom Inc., endorsed the plan, first unveiled in February, the society said.
The plan also has been endorsed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards operating under a charter from the society and the Federal Network Council.
The International Telecommunications Union, World Intellectual Property Organisation and International Trademark Association backed the plan as well, the society said.
Under the plan, new domain names such as "firm," "arts," and "web" will be added to the existing top-level domains such as "com," "net," and "org" starting in the third quarter of 1997, the society said.
The plan establishes an arbitration and mediation procedure for resolving disputes over names, such as when a trademarked name is used in an Internet address.
Last year, for example, toymaker Hasbro Inc. won a lawsuit to regain control of the address "candyland.com," which was being used for an adult Web site with nude photographs. But more complex disputes arise when both parties may have a legitimate claim to an address name.
"Responsible self-governance is the key factor in assuring that the Internet will reach its fullest potential," Internet Society President Donald Heath said.
Although other groups have tried to establish alternate domain names, they have not succeeded in persuading the vast majority of Internet service providers to add their new names to the computers that route information across the network.
The Internet Society plan met the needs of major providers.
"The Internet is growing up rapidly and it is vital that the processes, procedures and policies that define its adminstration be sound, stable and sustainable in an international setting," MCI Senior Vice President Vincent Cerf said.
MCI is a top operator of the Internet's backbone network.
Currently, one company, Network Solutions Inc., registers addresses under most existing top-level domains under a contract with the National Science Foundation. Under the plan, up to 28 new registration agents will be chosen in a process overseen by the Big Six accounting firm Arthur Andersen.
But Network Solutions Senior Vice President Don Telage said having so many registrars would create chaos on the Net.
"This plan risks the stability of the Internet," he said.
The current system functions "pretty well" without international arbitration procedures, Telage said, noting his company has registered 1.2 million addresses and been sued only 26 times.
Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions will come out with its own plan soon for reforming the domain name registration system, Telage added.
While Network Solutions charges $100 for a two-year registration, the new firms will be free to compete on price. All names will be maintained in a central, shared database.
Once Network Solution's contract with the National Science Foundation expires, the top-level domains it registers will be opened to all the other registry agents.
A broad range of Internet companies and organisations will gather in Geneva at the end of April to add their formal endorsements on a memorandum of understanding, Heath said.

Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, outlining a plan to overhaul Depression-era laws governing the U.S. financial sector, said Wednesday the Clinton administration favoured allowing banks to enter the securities and insurance fields.
"The old lines that separated insurance, securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared," Rubin said in a speech here.
The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, takes its place with several bills already introduced in Congress. "We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative," Rubin said.
Increased competition in financial services should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, Rubin said.
The new proposal did not take a firm position on the controversial question of allowing banks to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.
"Because of the nature of the issues and the complete lack of consensus, we think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress before settling on a final approach," Rubin said.
Some lawmakers, along with smaller banks and consumer groups, adamantly oppose allowing banks to combine with commercial firms. But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted.
Rubin outlined two possible approaches. Under one approach, some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded.
Under a second approach, no mixing would be allowed with banks but, as currently permitted, thrifts would be allowed to combine with  commercial firms.
If banks are allowed to mix with commercial firms, the reforms could take effect two years after enactment, Rubin said. If mixing is not allowed, the reforms could take effect in nine months.
The Federal Reserve should continue to oversee bank holding companies, while specific activities would be overseen by specific regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators.
Banks would be allowed to underwrite municipal revenue bonds. An exemption for banks in the federal mutual fund law, the Investment Company Act, would be narrowed.

On the Internet, where new products come and go in the blink of an eye, time is said to move at "Internet speed."
But in the rarefied air of Congress, where legislation often moves at a glacial pace, few would equate "Washington time" with the speed of cyberspace. That may be changing, however, as Congress struggles to come to grips with the Net as a phenomenon with great potential for reaching voters.
In the 1996 election, exit polls showed more than one-fourth of voters were "wired" and about 10 percent primarily used online sources of information in deciding how to vote. Responding to the surge in Net use by voters, congressional Internet use also has skyrocketed by some measures.
At the begining of 1994, just a handful of lawmakers had posted home pages on the World Wide Web. Two years later, 222 representatives and 85 senators had Web pages. The Congressional Internet Caucus has 91 members, up from 60 in the last Congress.
Despite the flurry of activity, Congress will never be on the cutting edge, according to some who work in the capital.
"I expect Congress will always be one or many steps behind," Chris Casey, who helped set up the first congressional Web page for Sen. Edward Kennedy, told a briefing about the Web for congressional staff sponsored by the Internet caucus last week.
A question about when Congress would be "up to speed" on the Net brought peals of laughter from the audience of staffers.
BEYOND WEB PAGES
Nonetheless, some legislators have gone beyond posting simple Web pages and have integrated the Net into the most basic operations of their congressional offices. Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat whose district encompasses Silicon Valley, created a special area on her Web site to give constituents individualized information (http://www-eshoo.house.gov). A constituent sends Eshoo a query and receives a personal answer posted on a private part of the site accessible only to that individual with a password.
Sen. Pat Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, participates in live online chat sessions with school children in his home state with transcripts on his Web site (http://www.senate.gov/leahy). Leahy's office also is planning to start a newsgroup, a type of group mailing list on the Net, devoted to Vermont issues.
Almost all legislators accept electronic mail but most respond on paper through the mail. Leahy's office is one of the few that answer e-mail with e-mail, staffer Paul Mann said. Although some feared this might overwhelm the office with too many messages, "surprisingly it hasn't happened," Mann said.
For the co-chairman of the Internet Caucus, Rep. Rick White, the Internet is a key foundation of his media strategy.
"The first place we send any press release is to our Web page," White staffer Aaron Weissman told the Web information session. Even media staff for the Washington state Republican Party look to the Web site (http://www.house.gov/white) to find copies of a release to send to the media, Weissman added.
The Internet is also changing the way groups lobby Congress. The Citizen's Internet Empowerment Coalition set up a Web page to get Internet users to send e-mail to Congress on the issue of restricting obscenity on the Net (http://www.ciec.org).
But since legislators are most interested in hearing from voters in their own districts, the page looks up the e-mail address of an Internet user and guides users to send targeted messages. "We have a responsibility as advocates to educate Internet users," said Jonah Seiger of the Center for Democracy and Technology, which helped set up the coalition's site.
Much more remains to be done to educate users and legislators. While the text of bills is available online, some advocates want Congress to make more information available.
"There are broad sections of the electorate that are entirely uninformed about what our Congress does," Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional Accountability Project, said. "So much of the problem is that it is very, very difficult to obtain in real time the core documents of our democracy."
Ruskin urged that Congress post an assortment of documents on the Web, including voting records, disclosure forms, testimony from hearings and draft legislation.

The International Monetary Fund opened a site on the Internet Thursday providing information about the types of economic data available in 18 member countries.
"For a long time we have been trying to press countries to report to us on a more timely basis, more information, and based on good statistical systems," said Jack Boorman, director of the IMF's policy and review department.
The 1994-95 Mexican peso crisis highlighted the need for timely and accurate data about developing countries, Boorman told a news conference.
The site does not include the countries' actual data -- that may come later -- but it lists contacts for obtaining the information.
"Good statistical citizenship helps to inform markets," Boorman said. "The whole purpose of this system is to help that process, to make sure that markets are getting better data in a timely way."
The Internet address of the site is http://dsbb.imf.org. It lists information such as the frequency, schedule and types of economic and financial data released on a regular basis by the countries which have subscribed to the fund's "Special Data Dissemination Standard."
The countries on the site are Argentina, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Slovenia, Switzerland, Thailand, Britain and the United States.
By next week, information about another eight countries is expected to be added. Those countries are Croatia, France, Hungary, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Sweden and Turkey.
Another eight countries have subscribed to the data standard but are not ready to go online. Those are Austria, Australia, Belgium, Chile, Columbia, Iceland, Israel, and Lithuania.
The special standard is being phased in over two years. countries agreed to meet the standards by Dec. 31, 1998.
Discussions are continuing with other countries that have not yet agreed to subscribe, including Germany, said John McLenaghan, director of the IMF statistics department.
IMF officials said the site could eventually include direct links to countries' data or other kinds of information.
"We're starting something which, while it has a very specific content and frame at the present time, has potential for going in directions that none of us perhaps quite see at the present time," Boorman said.

The Clinton administration has crafted a plan to reform what many call outdated U.S. banking laws and will begin making its positions known over the next few weeks, industry officials said Monday.
The administration will formally unveil its plan when Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testifies at a House Banking Committee hearing June 3, but details of the plan are expected to emerge as early as this week, the officials said.
Under Secretary John Hawke, a leading architect of the administration plan, is slated to speak here on Wednesday. In his speech, Hawke may indicate the administration's stand on mixing banking and commerce, lobbyists said.
"Mr. Hawke certainly won't do anything to upstage Rubin," one lobbyist in contact with the administration noted. "But we will hear generally where they are on some of these topics."
While most in Congress and the finance industry agree that the Depression-era barriers separating banking from securities and insurance should be torn down, there is little consensus about going farther and allowing banks to combine with securities and other firms.
The administration's position has evolved over the past several months. A task force on financial reform headed by Hawke initially recommended eliminating all barriers.
But the specter of Citicorp or Chase Manhattan merging with General Motors Corp. or Microsoft Corp. drew strong protests from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach of Iowa, as well as prominent labor and consumer groups.
And during the spring, several Democratic senators, led by Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, wrote to Rubin to register their opposition to mixing banking and commerce.
Bowing somewhat to the criticism, the administration is now said to favor allowing limited combinations. Financial firms would be limited to a "basket" of non-financial activity, expressed as a percentage of total revenue or capital, some lobbyists said.
But the basket could be further limited by prohibiting combinations of the largest financial and non-financial firms. For example, one approach would be to bar the 1,000 biggest commercial firms from owning or being owned by banks.
Another difficult issue concerns regulating disparate financial businesses within a diversified firm.
Almost everyone favors "functional regulation," meaning that each activity of a firm would be regulated by the appropriate regulator. The Securities and Exchange Commission would regulate securities activities while state insurance regulators would oversee insurance sales, for example.
But debate continues about the level of federal intrusion in insurance regulation as well as the need for a top-level regulator to oversee entire firms.
While some favor setting the Federal Reserve at the top of the heap, the administration is expected to back a committee approach. The committee would be composed of representatives of the various functional regulators.

Scientists working on the next generation of the Internet are finding their first challenge is to convince a sceptical U.S. Congress to fund the project.
Rather than stumbling over new hardware or software, the next generation network has quickly run into several road blocks on Capitol Hill.
On Tuesday, scientists involved with the project, including President Bill Clinton's top science adviser John Gibbons, will try to soothe concerns at a Senate hearing.
Some lawmakers are worried that the project lacks focus and is not sufficiently different from a related university project known as Internet2.
The next generation Internet project, announced with great fanfare by Clinton during last year's presidential campaign, aims to send data at 1,000 times the speed of today's net. Higher speed and improved reliability could spur a host of new uses for the network, some with sound and video.
Clinton pledged the government would spend $100 million annually for five years to build the super high-speed network and promote its use.
The money was to come from reallocating existing research funds, but that plan is already in trouble. In April, the House of Representatives passed a budget for the National Science Foundation that specifically barred any spending on the next generation Internet.
The bill is awaiting action by the Senate and could be modified before going to the president's desk.
In May, 28 senators sent a letter to science adviser Gibbons complaining about the composition of the next generation Internet's advisory board. The senators, from both political parties but all from rural states, noted that the board's 20 members came from only eight states.
"Instead of a potentially major positive development, therefore, 'Next Generation Internet' and Internet2 becomes a significant source of concern for us," the senators wrote in the letter obtained by Reuters.
National Science Foundation officials are confident that the programme will go forward. "Next Generation Internet is a presidential initiative that will have a lot of congressional involvement," NSF spokeswoman Elizabeth Gaston said.
Congressional staffers said for the time being they remained confused about the administration's priorities. "Everyone I speak with tells me different things about what these programmes are supposed to do, and which agencies get which portions of the budget," one staffer said.
To some degree, the confusion reflects the changing fortunes of the Internet. While the original Internet, including connections to universities, was largely funded by government, this time around higher education and industry are more likely to foot some of the bill.
More than 100 schools have pledged to spend $50 million a year on Internet2, mainly for higher speed connections and switches. The schools are also seeking corporate sponsorship.
Less government involvement for building the plumbing frees up more resources for cutting-edge research, according to George Strawn, director of the NSF's division of networking and communications research.
"The first time around, the NSF sort of had to take the lead to diffuse it to all of higher education because there wasn't an industry yet," Strawn said. "Now that there is, as soon as it becomes cost effective we've got peddlers out there who will find higher education a receptive customer."
The original Internet began as a Defence Department project called ARPAnet to link far-flung computer centres. Funded mostly by the government until the mid-1980s, the net is now run almost entirely by private companies including MCI Communications Corp, Sprint Corp and BBN Corp.
Representatives from those companies gathered with other stars of the Internet community in Virginia two weeks ago for a "next generation" planning meeting. Some will return to Washington next week to explain the project to Congress.

Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined on Wednesday the Clinton administration's plan to allow banks to get into the securities and insurance businesses, eliminating 60-year-old legal barriers enacted during the Great Depression.
"The old lines that separated insurance, securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared," Rubin said.
The plan would allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to compete directly under a uniform set of regulations. That increased competition should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, Rubin said in a speech at the Exchequer Club here.
The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, takes its place with several bills already introduced in Congress. "We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative," Rubin said.
House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach welcomed the plan, but said some substantive issues were unresolved.
"While differences of judgment on several key legislative points remain, Secretary Rubin's statement today is very constructive to the process," the Iowa Republican said.
Industry participants said the administration plan would give the reform effort a needed boost.
The proposal "should provide considerable momentum for long-needed reform," Bankers Trust New York Corp. Chairman Frank Newman said. Newman gave the effort some prior momentum last month, when his bank took advantage of recent regulatory changes and acquired the securities firm Alex. Brown Inc.
Consumer advocates, however, complained that the proposal did not contain adequate measures to protect bank customers buying insurance.
"We're very disappointed that there are no protections on insurance," Mary Griffin of Consumers Union said. Banks have a weak track record in that area, she added.
Credit insurance on mortgages, the second most popular insurance product sold by banks, "is one of the biggest consumer rip-offs out there," she said.
The Rubin proposal did not take a firm position on the controversial question of allowing banks to combine with non-financial, commercial firms.
"Because of the nature of the issues and the complete lack of consensus, we think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress before settling on a final approach," Rubin said.
Some lawmakers, along with smaller banks and consumer groups, adamantly oppose allowing banks to combine with commercial firms. But insurance companies and securities firms say they are already intertwined with non-financial interests and could not compete with banks if such combinations were not permitted.
Rubin outlined two possible approaches. Under one approach, some mixing would be permitted but limited and with the 1,000 largest non-financial firms excluded.
Under a second approach, no mixing would be allowed with banks but, as currently permitted, thrifts would be allowed to combine with commercial firms.

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged lawmakers on Thursday to put off consideration of controversial proposals that would allow banks to merge with commercial companies, such as carmakers.
Instead, he said Congress should press ahead with more modest financial reforms that would knock down the 60-year-old legal barriers that prevent banks from affiliating with insurance companies and securities firms.
"Congress should widen the permissible range of affiliations for banking organisations in order to expand the choices for consumers and increase the efficiency of financial markets," Greenspan told the House Banking Committee.
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined the Clinton administration's plan to allow banks to get into the securities and insurance businesses.
But Rubin sidestepped the controversial question of whether banks should be allowed to merge with commercial companies, instead offering Congress two proposals -- one that would allow such combinations, and another that would not.
Greenspan acknowledged that the barriers separating banks and commercial companies will eventually crumble with the continued advance of technology.
But he urged caution in knocking them down now, in part because of uncertainties over how that would affect the U.S. financial system.
"Any wider authorisation of banking and commerce should be postponed while we focus on financial modernisation," Greenspan said.
The administration plan would allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to compete directly under a uniform set of regulations. That increased competition should benefit consumers, generating savings of up to $15 billion a year, according to Rubin.
The highly anticipated administration proposal, originally expected in March, took its place with several bills already introduced in Congress to overhaul the Glass Steagall Act of 1933. "We look forward to working with Congress on this important initiative," Rubin said.
Congress and the banking industry have been working to reform the law for more than a decade without success. But this year, previous opponents of reform have come to the table as regulators and courts have chipped away at the law and granted banks some new powers.

Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin goes to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to further explain the Clinton administration's bank reform plan, but lawmakers are likely to focus foremost on what the plan left out.
The Clinton proposal, along with several pending bills, would scrap the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act's separation of banking from other financial services.
On the contentious issue of going further and allowing banks to combine with commercial firms, however, the administration ducked.  
Instead, the Clinton plan unveiled by Rubin on May 21, offered two alternatives and left the hard choice to Congress.
"We think the issue needs to be further debated by Congress," the secretary said as he announced the plan.
Congress has debated overhauling antiquated U.S. banking laws for more than a decade without success and some analysts suggest the banking and commerce issue will sidetrack this year's attempts.
At Tuesday's House Banking Committee hearing, opponents of mixing banking and commerce led by committee chairman and Iowa Republican Jim Leach will try to steer Rubin to examine the risks of unlimited mergers.
Proponents, including subcommittee chairpersons Marge Roukema and Richard Baker, Republicans from New Jersey and Louisiana respectively, will take the opposite tack.
Under one of the two alternative outlined by Rubin last month, limited mixing would be permitted but excluding the 1,000 or so largest nonfinancial firms, measured by asset size.  
Bank holding companies could derive "some significant percentage" of their gross revenues from commercial activity under the approach, referred to as a basket limitation.
Under the second alternative, the current prohibition on mixing would be maintained but the current exception allowing commercial firms to own savings and loan institutions would also be maintained.
The administration chose to walk a fine line on the issue after Democratic legislators and traditionally Democratic labor and consumer groups came out against combining banking and commerce.
On Monday, other opponents including small bankers and agriculture groups issued a statement against even limited mixing of banking and commerce.
"Say NO to those who would undermine the world's strongest and most dynamic economic and financial system," the groups said. The 31 signers of the statement ranged from the National Bankers Association to the National Bakers Association.
Some lawmakers also plan to raise concerns at the hearing that portions of the Clinton plan contain loopholes that would render any limitations on banking and commerce irrelevent, staffers said.  
Any firm could own a thrift and establish a so-called wholesale financial institution. Wholesale banks could only accepts deposits over $100,000, would not be covered by deposit insurance, but would have access to the Federal Reserve's electronic payment system.
"The way the wholesale institution is structured would allow enormous activity," one staffer said. "It's a big loophole."
The notion of allowing savings and loans to continue operating under different rules than banks is also likely to draw some criticism.
Under legislation passed by Congress last year to recapitalize the savings industry's deposit insurance fund, the Clinton administration was directed to report on how the legal charters of the two industries could be merged.

Australian retailer Coles Myer Ltd is praying a cold, wet winter will cheer up the group's struggling apparel business and add new growth to annual profit.
Chief executive Dennis Eck, speaking after Coles announced another firm rise in quarterly sales, said he remained cautious about the profit outlook for its three main apparel businesses.
"That (apparel) is the thing that most concerns us," Eck told Reuters on Thursday.  
Earlier, Coles posted a 6.5 percent rise in sales revenue to A$4.559 billion for the quarter ended April 27, bringing total sales for the year to date to A$14.5 billion, up 5.7 percent.
Coles' best-performing supermarkets division again led the result, recording a 12.3 percent jump in sales revenue for the quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago.
The group's once-struggling merchandise group, especially its Kmart chain of stores, also improved, posting a 5.8 percent rise in sales revenue, including fatter profit margins at Kmart.  
But sales at Coles' women's wear business, Katies, as well as its Target discount stores and its Myer Grace Bros department store chain, which both rely heavily on clothing sales, were all down.
Eck said fashion sales depended on extremes of weather and that a wet, cold winter could help revive them.
"I'm hoping for cold and rain for 20 more days and that would be nice," he said. "It's a nice cold rainy day and May is when you really sell through your winter."
A Sydney-based retail analyst agreed the weather had helped prolong weakness in Coles apparel sales.  
"One of the reasons why this quarter has been so bad (for apparel) is this incredible Indian summer we have been having, and fashion needs extremes of weather," he told Reuters.
Some economists have argued apparel sales are the victim of a long-term shift in spending patterns, with entertainment and other consumer items competing for household incomes.
But Eck defended Coles' apparel businesses and rejected a suggestion it sell Katies, its only speciality fashion business.
"If you take straight apparel as a category, it represents...no more than 16 percent of our business, including Katies," he said.  
"We are happy to be in that segment. We think we have a very good balance to the retail category that we sell, and we are not in the mood to make short-term decisions on cyclical events.
"When apparel gets good again, it will be very nice to own a specialty apparel business," Eck said.  
Weak apparel sales were offset in the third quarter by strong sales from the supermarket and Kmart businesses, enabling Eck to stick to his forecast of steady second-half profits.
"We...(had) stated that we expected a similar percentage growth in the second-half profit after tax to that experienced in the first half, excluding property disposal profits and abnormals," Eck said in a statement.
"We are still of that view, subject to conditions remaining stable."  
Analysts are forecasting Coles to report, on average, a net profit before abnormals of A$326.7 million for the year to July 27, according to an April survey by Barceps forecasting service.
Coles reported a pre-abnormal net profit of A$302 million in 1995/96.

The world's biggest miner, RTZ-CRA, announced a major realignment of its sprawling empire on Wednesday and removed any doubt that London was its capital.
The group, born of a 1995 merger of London-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd, said it would now manage its global businesses along six main product lines.
These were aluminium, copper, energy, industrial minerals, iron ore, and gold and other minerals. Together they reaped revenues of around US$8 billion for the group in calendar 1996 from operations on all six continents.
RTZ-CRA said it would shrink its Melbourne office, CRA's home base and until now the group's "other" headquarters. It will halve the staff there, shedding 100 jobs, and leave the office with a support role only.
CRA chairman John Uhrig said in outlining the changes that the merger, which maintained the two firms' separate listings, had so far not produced a better outcome for shareholders.
"It would have been surprising if it had in its first year of operation," Uhrig told a news conference in Melbourne.
The restructuring leaves Australian-based executives to manage the aluminium, energy and iron ore businesses from Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. London handles the rest and remains the sole group headquarters.
The Salt Lake City office of its Kennecott copper operation in the United States as well as the group's Johannesburg office would be closed, it added.
The new structure shifts the focus of management away from a geographical view of the world, where operations differ by country, toward a single management for each global business.
It ensures RTZ-CRA does not become an unwieldy bureaucracy unable to compete with more nimble rivals which deal in just one commodity, the group said.
Chief executive Leon Davis gave examples where, under the current structure, copper operations and coal mines were under several different leaderships across the globe.
"These are barriers that are artificially created and we are intent on removing them," Davis told the news conference.
"It will eliminate duplication, lower our costs and improve our efficiency," he added.
Mining analysts welcomed the move. One viewed it as confirmation the RTZ-CRA marriage, made without any shares actually changing hands, was effectively a cheap buy-out of CRA.
"If anyone thought the DLC (dual-listed structure) was anything other than a buy-out on the cheap, they should assess this little move because they are virtually wiping out Melbourne head office," a Sydney-based analyst told Reuters.
The analyst said he expected the group to eventually transform the dual-listed structure into the one company.
RTZ-CRA has already proposed to ditch its double-barrelled name and become known, subject to shareholder approval this year, as Rio Tinto. RTZ's shares would then trade in London as Rio Tinto Plc and CRA's stock in Australia as Rio Tinto Ltd.
A Melbourne-based analyst said the cementing of London as the group's headquarters came as no surprise. "It doesn't make any sense to have two head offices," he said.

The consortium believed to be the winning bidder for Australia's Loy Yang A power station has minimised the U.S. dollar-component of the A$4.75 billion deal to about US$500 million, a corporate source said on Tuesday.
"There's no massive splash from a foreign exchange point of view," the source, who is close to the bidding, told Reuters.
The consortium said to have won the bidding comprises U.S. utilities CMS Energy Corp, with about 50 percent, and NRG Energy Inc and Horizon Energy Investments Ltd, each with about 25 percent.  
Local currency dealers said they thought about A$400 million to A$500 million cover had been taken on Monday ahead of the deal's announcement, which is likely at about midday.
Horizon is a vehicle for Australian institutions led by Macquarie Bank's Infrastructure Trust of Australia Group Ltd.
The consortium's capital structure is designed around a high gearing ratio of around 75 percent, with bank debt, indexed bonds and subordinated debt accounting for almost A$3.6 billion of the A$4.75 billion bid, sources said.  
All of the debt and a quarter of the equity component will be raised in Australia, leaving the balance of the equity to be funded offshore, the Melbourne source said.
"There's no big tranche of offshore dollars greater than what was done in the past for Yallorn and Hazelwood," he said.
The Victoria state government's earlier sale of its Yallorn and Hazelwood power stations involved around US$500 million in foreign equity, the source said.
The Loy Yang A consoritum's foreign exposure was already covered, he added.  
"We have mitigated already but, given the capital structure of the deal, there is a negligible impact from a foreign exchange point of view," the source said.

Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, urged Australia on Monday to press China into talks over the future of the remote Himalayan region and said he was ready to visit Beijing in the right "atmosphere".
Seen by Beijing as the leader of a pro-independence movement in Tibet, the Dalai Lama said he wanted to ask Australian Prime Minister John Howard to press China into opening a dialogue on the political future of Tibet.
"In case I have the opportunity of meeting (Howard), the main thing which I want to mention is...to appeal to the Australian government to help to materialise meaningful negotiations with the Chinese government," the Dalai Lama told a news conference in Melbourne.
A meeting with Howard, who returns from an overseas trip toward the end of the Dalai Lama's two-week trip, has yet to be arranged, but Howard has not ruled out talks despite warnings from Beijing against official contact with the Tibetan god king.
China has already chided New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger for meeting the Dalai Lama in Wellington last week.
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer met the Dalai Lama on his arrival in Sydney on Saturday night, but said later that the talks were unofficial.
The Dalai Lama, exiled from Tibet since 1959, told the news conference the prospects for negotiations with Beijing had faded since his emissary met China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, partly due to domestic politics and frosty Sino-U.S. relations.
"At the moment the Chinese government, their main concern is to simply show the world and also their own people they are a big nation... No-one can influence them," he said.
The Dalai Lama, who wants a form of regional autonomy for Tibet, suggested that Beijing's "one China-two systems" policy governing its takeover of Hong Kong next year, and its goal of reunification with Taiwan, could serve as a model for Tibet.
"All these things are the more humane way," he said, adding he was ready to visit Beijing. "As soon as some appropriate atmosphere develops, I am ready to visit China," he added.
The 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner also accused China of continuing to detain his seven-year-old spiritual deputy, the Panchen Lama.
"My Panchen Lama in effect is the youngest political prisoner. Seven years old. How sad," he said of Tibet's second holiest monk, believed to be the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama who died in Beijing in 1989.
"According to (my) information, he is somewhere near Beijing, as a prisoner under house arrest," the Dalai Lama said, adding that he feared for the boy's life.
China last month denied it was holding the boy but refused to recognise him as the 11th Panchen Lama. Beijing has instead installed its own new Panchen Lama, a boy of the same age.
"Tibetan Buddhist culture at the moment is facing a threat of extinction ...Whether intentionally or unintentionally, some kind of cultural genocide is taking place in our country," the Dalai Lama said.

The world's biggest miner, RTZ-CRA, said on Wednesday it needed to polish its public image after it came under attack for the second time in as many weeks.
A fortnight after protesters swarmed on the group's London annual meeting, Australian trade unionists and conservationists infiltrated a shareholders' meeting in Melbourne, criticising its record on human rights, labour and environmental issues.  
RTZ-CRA's Australian chairman, John Uhrig, and some of the protesters, speaking as Australian shareholders or their proxy, engaged at times in shouting matches inside the meeting hall.
Trade unionists from Australia's coal and iron ore industries accused RTZ-CRA of intimidating workers, while others claimed it refused to stand up against human rights abuses.
Uhrig strongly denied the accusations and appeared to feel protesters were hijacking the meeting, insisting other shareholders be allowed to speak.
He finally called on a vote to have the meeting closed.  
But later, speaking to reporters, he said work needed to be done to improve the group's public image. "In the general community, I am sure we have a job to do," Uhrig said.
The company needs to do more work in Australia to improve its public image than probably elsewhere in the world, because the group enjoys such a high profile here, he added.
He referred in particular to RTZ-CRA's labour relations.
"The general public really does not understand what we have done and maybe that needs to be explained," Uhrig said.

Australia's biggest retailer Coles Myer Ltd on Thursday reported a 41-percent surge in half-year earnings, its first profit rise in almost two years.
The result buoyed Coles' once-sinking share price, which rose despite a weaker market, and followed a two-year nightmare of sliding profits, shareholder anger and consumer thrift.
Coles, which pockets about 18 cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, reported a net profit of A$273.6 million (US$217 million) for the half-year ended January 26, compared with A$194.5 million a year ago.
Before abnormals, net earnings leapt 23 percent to a better-than-expected A$229 million, boosting the shares 13 cents above Wednesday's close to a high of A$6.04 before easing back.
"We see this as a very good first step on a road to recovery," chief executive Dennis Eck told reporters.
Coles' performance has now recovered to the levels of its year ended July 1995, one of its most profitable ever, he added.
Coles gave a bullish forecast for 1996/97 annual profit, predicting more strong profit growth in the second half-year and looking forward to a quieter time in the nation's newspapers.
Coles is rising from the ashes of poor management and board turmoil.
In late 1995, a controversy surrounding Coles' largest shareholder and then chairman, Solomon Lew, erupted in the nation's media. At one point, media baron Rupert Murdoch accused Lew of thuggery and trying to stifle newspaper coverage.
The row focused on a transaction that cost Coles A$18 million and benefitted a company associated with Lew by a similar sum. Lew denied any impropriety but stepped down as chairman in 1995 in the first of several board shake-ups.
Coles managing director Peter Bartels quit in December, handing the reins over to Eck who appeared on Thursday to be relieved Coles was no longer in the headlines.
"For a couple of months, our staff was quite happy to see us out of the press," Eck said.
Retail analysts are tipping Coles to report annual net profit of around A$310 million in 1996/97. One analyst said profit forecasts for Coles might now edge a little higher, but improving sentiment was mainly behind the firmer share price.
"I think the retail market is picking up, but it's still tough out there," the Melbourne-based analyst said.
The half-year results highlighted Coles success in improving profit margins. The 23 percent rise in pre-abnormal profit was struck on a 5.4 percent increase in sales to A$9.945 billion.
"What is important are people's expectations of the turnaround now. I think that's why the stock is where it is, on anticipation of much better margins and profit," a broker said.
Coles is not the only big retailer to weather tough trading conditions and investor scepticism.
Upmarket retailer and rival David Jones Ltd is now feeling the heat. Its chief executive resigned this week on the eve of the company reporting a 50 percent dive in half-year net earnings.

Australia's Trust Bank has begun looking for a strategic equity partner, inviting offers for a 49 percent stake and announcing plans to put the small, 162-year-old bank on the map.
But Australian banks need not apply, nor any foreigners which do not share Trust Bank's ambition to expand beyond the shores of Australia's small island state of Tasmania, managing director Paul Kemp told Reuters.
"We will be very keen to sort out anybody who thinks they can come in and make a quick killing," Kemp said.  
"They won't really get to first base with us."
Kemp was responding to media speculation that prospective partners would be interested in acquiring the stake to enable it to issue credit cards in Australia.
"We would have a broader vision than just that for the franchise. It (a partner) would really need to be an organisation with a broad vision of the expansion of financial services, not just confined to credit cards," he said.
Trust bank, which has assets of about A$1.8 billion and is the dominant home lender in Tasmania, has just four branches elsewhere in Australia. But the bank has national ambitions.

Australian aluminium producer Comalco Ltd said on Wednesday its smelting division was back in profit and that major expansion work was starting to pay off.
Comalco, which plunged into the red in calendar 1996 after a rotten year of low aluminium prices and high costs, said it had turned a "reasonable" profit for the first three months of 1997.
Comalco is owned 67 percent by global mining giant RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd, soon to be renamed Rio Tinto.  
Speaking at the company's annual meeting, chairman Leigh Clifford also announced a new pot line at its majority-owned Boyne Island smelter in Queensland would be running at full steam from the third quarter of 1997.
The A$1 billion expansion, in which Comalco has a 59.25 percent stake, as well as recent expansions and upgrades at its Tasmanian and New Zealand smelters, will take the company's share of total output to over 650,000 tonnes in 1998, he said.
The world aluminium market is also improving, with the London Metal Exchange price averaging 74 U.S. cents per pound so far in 1997, Clifford said. It averaged 70 cents in 1996.  
"Aluminium demand is strong in Asia and North America and the outlook for the industry is robust," Clifford said.
Brokerage HSBC James Capel expects Comalco to report a net profit before abnormals of about A$120 million in 1997, assuming a firm rise in aluminium price in the second half of the year.
"A chunk of that earnings will be as much a function of increased production volumes as price," HSBC James Capel analyst Unit Safak told Reuters.
Comalco reported a bottom-line loss of A$16.8 million on a joint-venture basis for 1996, after abnormal losses before tax of A$93.8 million.  
The closure of Comalco's kaolin plant at its bauxite mine in Weipa, in north Queensland, and workforce restructuring accounted for most of the abnormal losses.
By the end of 1997, Comalco expects to have shed 600 workers since September last year, chief executive Terry Palmer said.
With about 80 percent of workforce restructuring complete, cost reductions played a part in first quarter profits, he said.
"The impact (of lower costs) has been pretty solid," Palmer told reporters after the brief meeting.  
Comalco, the only one of RTZ-CRA's business not performing in the most efficient quartile of the world's producers in 1996, hopes to reach that benchmark in 1998.
"I think to get to those sorts of levels you have to look at well into next year," Palmer said.
Comalco was not prepared on Wednesday to say when it would decide on the site for its remaining major project, a A$1 billion alumina refinery.
The refinery is to be sited in Sarawak, Malaysia, or at Gladstone, Queensland, depending on which site offers the better deal on price and security of power supply.  
In Queensland or Malaysia, the refinery would be powered by gas.

Australian paper and packaging giant Amcor Ltd, continuing a run of depressing profit results and forecasts, said on Tuesday that it hoped the worst would be over in 1996/97 (July/June).  
Amcor managing director Don Macfarlane said full-year net profit would be lower than the A$338.8 million achieved in 1995/96 but he saw paper prices rising from early calendar 1998.
"If you read the things we have said since the half-year (profit announcement) you would have to come to that conclusion," Macfarlane told Reuters.
"Hopefully this is the worst of it," he added.
His comments followed a statement in which Amcor said second half results would be lower than a year-ago and than the 1996/97 first half. There would also be some significant write-downs.

Australia's labour market watchdog is expected to award the nation's lowest-paid workers a wage rise on Tuesday in a move that is likely to have profound implications for inflation and interest rates.
Financial markets are on tenterhooks as the Industrial Relations Commission prepares to arbitrate in an old-style showdown between the trade union movement and employers.
The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has asked for a wage rise of A$20 (US15.50) per week for the lowest paid, as well as rises in minimum rates of pay of up to 8.75 percent.
Employers oppose it, saying it will harm the economy.
The central bank has also expressed concern at the ACTU's so-called "living wage" claim, which seeks to help workers left behind in Australia's move away from centrally-fixed wages toward individual deals hammered out on the factory floor.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) estimates the claim, if granted in full, would swell the nation's total wages bill by 1.6 percent, taking the rate of wages growth to about 5.5 percent, well above the bank's comfort zone of 4.0-4.5 percent.
Employers go further, saying Australia's jobless rate would jump sharply higher as industry adjusted to the higher labour costs by shedding staff.
"If the ACTU claim were granted, unemployment would race past a million, inflation would rise well above its current level, interest rates would lift and investment growth would come to an immediate halt," a peak employer group has warned.
Australia's jobless rate was at 8.7 percent in March, and has been stuck at or above 8.5 percent since early 1995.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said it believes the ACTU's claim would increase the national wages bill by more like 4.8 percent, based on an industry survey showing more workers were covered by the claim than commonly thought.
Financial markets are also jumpy, with inflation data for the March quarter to be released on Wednesday, the day after the commission's decision is handed down.
"You never know which way they (the commission) are going to jump. It's a fairly big week...," National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster told Reuters on Monday.
Market economists are tipping 2.1 percent underlying inflation for the year to March, comfortably within the RBA's target range of two to three percent.
Economists predict the commission will hand down a compromise on Tuesday, leaving minimum rates of pay alone and granting a wage rise of between A$10 and A$15 per week.
This would exceed the government's position, which is to support a rise of A$8 per week for the lowest paid, but would not move the RBA to lift interest rates sooner than expected, they said. Rates are currently tipped to rise late in 1997.
(A$1 = US$0.77)

In China's headlong rush to develop, first in its fanatical leftwing past and then in the get-rich-quick days of reform, it has hacked or bulldozed away much of its architectural heritage.
Graceful old courtyards of Beijing have fallen victim to the development onslaught in recent years, crumbling alongside one of the earliest casualties -- the once majestic Beijing city wall.
Built to ward off invaders centuries ago, the wall was unable to withstand the inroads of its own people bent on discarding what was considered out of date.
But China's capital is trying to make amends for some of its past excesses by restoring a small portion of the wall that encircled the city until it was dismantled in the years after the communist takeover in 1949.
Residents of Beijing have been answering a public call to return city wall bricks to help rebuild a small section of the structure.
Bricks once buried in courtyards, kept as household ornaments or used as building materials have been handed over to a group restoring the wall under the direction of the Beijing city government.
"We hope to have about 115 metres of the wall restored this year," said Li Yancheng of the Beijing Historical Relics Construction Co of the municipal government.
MING DYNASTY KILNS
Some 30,000 bricks from the old wall have been donated to the project and now sit stacked on a city lot where they will be used in the restoration effort.
Workers chip off hardened soil, revealing the names of Ming dynasty kilns (1368-1644 A.D.) where the bricks were fired.
"As a child I remember helping take down part of the wall," said Li. "Adults were doing it so I joined in. Now I have a chance to put some of the wall back together."
The wall, which stood 12 metres (39 ft) tall and 16 metres wide (52 ft) in some places, was built largely in the Ming dynasty, although some parts dated back to the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368 A.D.), a period of Mongol rule.
CITY WALL CLEARED TO MAKE ROOM FOR TIANANMEN SQUARE
Large chunks of the wall were pulled down in the 1950s when Beijing's communist leaders created Tiananmen Square.
More was torn down in the 1960s and 1970s for the construction of one of the city's main roads and for the subway.
Many of the city gates were left standing, although what had been the Zhonghua Gate is now the site of the mausoleum for late revolutionary leader Mao Zedong in the centre of Tiananmen Square.
In more recent years, market-style economic reforms have sent real estate values soaring, leading to the wholesale clearing of older buildings to make way for sleak new office towers.
One such real estate project has led to the demolition of homes that had been built up against the wall. The outline of those homes is still visible on the section being restored.
The redevelopment has also revealed a bomb shelter, built nearby during tension with the former Soviet Union in the 1960s and using city wall bricks.
RETIRED SHOEMAKER ANSWERS STATE'S CALL FOR HELP
Hai Changhai, a 71-year-old retired shoemaker, is one of the Beijing residents who answered the state's call to bring back bricks taken home when the wall was demolished.
"They were in our yard and weren't doing anyone much good," he said after pedalling his tricycle across town to make a donation. "Now the state can make use of them."
Some Beijing residents point an accusing finger at the state -- and the ruling Communist Party -- for all the destruction of the past.
"None of the communist leaders wanted to protect these things," said Dai Qing, a dissident writer who has been active in preserving historical relics. "None of them spoke up."
One of the few people who did speak out was Liang Sicheng, the head of prestigious Qinghua University's construction department in the early days of communist rule.
"He was very critical of the development plans," said Cheng Zhihua, a professor at the same department at Qinghua today.
"But he had little influence because the official media did not publish his views," said Cheng.
What Liang had to say was dangerous then, and he was persecuted for his views during the Cultural Revolution, a decade of leftist fanaticism that began in 1965.
Beijing officials say there is a growing awareness of the need to preserve the past. Some residents say that may be because so much of the city's heritage has already disappeared.
Some say other factors may also play a role.
A museum may be built near the wall when it is restored and city planners soon will have another tourist attraction.

A top Chinese official for contacts with Taiwan ruled out an early resumption of talks on reunification because the island's leaders were pursuing "splittist" policies, the China Daily said on Tuesday.
It also quoted Tang Shubei, vice-chairman of the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), as saying that Taiwanese authorities did not want the handover of Hong Kong to go smoothly and might try to disrupt the transfer of power.
"In the long term the mainland and Taiwan should sit down at the negotiating table to discuss cross-straits issues under the 'one-China' policy," Tang was quoted as saying.
But he said the atmosphere for talks would not improve in the short term unless Taiwan's leaders, including its "so-called" President Lee Teng-hui, halted their "splittist" activities aimed at independence for the island.
China and Taiwan have been rivals since the Nationalist government fled to the island after its defeat by the communists in the Chinese civil war in 1949.
Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and tries to isolate it diplomatically.
Talks between the two sides were broken off after President Lee made a landmark private visit to the United States in mid-1995, enraging Beijing.
"We have the patience to handle the issue of the peaceful reunification of the motherland," Tang said.
The newspaper also said Taiwan authorities would likely take measures to reduce the impact on the island from the success of China's policies towards Hong Kong, which reverts to Beijing sovereignty on July 1 after 150 years of British rule.
"According to Tang, there is information that Taiwan forces in Hong Kong are planning to cause trouble, such as demonstrations around July 1, when China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over the territory," the newspaper said.
Tang also repeated Beijing's long-held stance that the United States should halt arms sales to Taiwan.
The Chinese official's remarks were published by the English language newspaper as the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, was visiting Taiwan.
Beijing insists the 1989 winner of the Nobel Peace prize is waging a campaign for independence for Tibet.
Tang made no mention of Beijing's announcement last week that it would return a Taiwanese man suspected of hijacking a Taiwan passenger jet to mainland China.
Beijing wants Taiwan to return Chinese hijackers now in Taiwanese jails but so far it has been disappointed.

China marked on Saturday the first "tombsweeping" day since the death of Deng Xiaoping with few outward signs of remembrance for the late paramount leader.
Thousands of Beijing residents streamed through the gates of Babaoshan cemetery for the Qingming festival, traditionally the day for tidying ancestral graves.
But for the most part this was a family occasion, far removed from the political limelight that surrounded Deng during his lifetime.
"I have come here every year since my husband died in 1991," said a Beijing resident, holding the hand of her granddaughter as they left the cemetery.
"This is a family matter. There is no connection with any political leaders."
A group of students from Deng's native province of Sichuan, all of them enrolled at a university in the Chinese capital, gathered at the cemetery gates. They too had a private reason for being there.
"We are helping a friend sweep his father's grave," said one of the students.
Deng died on February 19 aged 92. He was cremated at Babaoshan and his ashes scattered at sea in accordance with his wishes.
That has left the public with no specific place to honour the man who steered China away from the radical policies of Mao Zedong and onto the path of economic development, even if it meant adopting capitalist ways.
Those pragmatic policies raised living standards and turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse.
Beijing's central Tiananmen Square has been one such place to honour the nation's fallen heroes but public displays of respect were not encouraged on this day.
Early on Saturday, as a group of secondary students walked towards the shrine to martyrs of the revolution at the centre of the square, they were quickly approached by security men.
After a brief discussion, they were allowed to bow and then told to leave, witnesses said.
China's communist leaders have traditionally planted trees on the Qingming festival and that was how the official media chose to remember Deng.
The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, showed photographs of Deng planting trees over the years since 1979, when he began his programme of reforms that changed China's political landscape.
"Now these trees have grown tall," said the newspaper.
In the spirit of Deng's reforms, vendors of silk flowers were doing brisk business outside the Babaoshan cemetery.
Visitors queued up to buy wreaths similar to those that adorned grave sites inside.
Deng was in the thoughts of other Beijing residents, such as Bai Lansheng, a sculptor who is working on a bronze statue of the late leader.
"We are getting ready to ship the plaster mould to Shanghai now," he said from his Beijing workshop. "There it will be cast in bronze."
In June the six-metre (20-foot) statue will be shipped to the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders the British colony of Hong Kong.
Deng directed negotiations that led to the 1984 Sino-British accord under which the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.
Deng died before the colony's recovery but his statue will gaze across the border and "witness" the historic event.

China said on Monday it had not made contributions to the U.S. Democratic Party to influence American policy and the visit by U.S. Vice President Al Gore had no link to improper payments.
The official People's Daily also pointed an accusing finger at Taiwan for stirring up accusations of Chinese involvement to try to shift blame from itself.
"The Chinese government is not involved in the so-called 'political contributions scandal' in the slightest way and is entirely free of guilt," said the newspaper in a signed commentary.
The Washington Post has reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six members of Congress last year that they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign contributions from foreign corporations.
"The development of Sino-U.S. relations is based on principles," the People's Daily said.
Gore is scheduled to arrive in Beijing later on Monday, making him the most senior U.S. official to visit in eight years.
His trip is aimed at healing ties that had been badly strained by disputes ranging from human rights to trade and Taiwan.
It is also intended to pave the way for an exchange of visits by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
"The continuation of high level visits, such as the visit of U.S. Vice President Gore and others, is due to the efforts of the two governments and their peoples," the newspaper said.
"To insist that this is linked to the so-called contributions scandal is ridiculous," it said. "It is a complete fabrication to allege that the improvement in Sino-U.S. relations is due to any improper payments by the Chinese government."
The People's Daily commentary condemned Taiwan as well as news organisations from the island for the storm of criticism that has engulfed China.
"It is widely known that the 'political payments case' stems from Taiwan," the newspaper said.
It referred to a report last year by a Hong Kong publication, the Chinese language edition of Asiaweek magazine, that said Liu Tai-ying, head of the business management committee of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party, had expressed a willingness to contribute $15 million.
The People's Daily did not mention that Taiwan has denied the allegations and has sued the magazine.
"For some Taiwan politicians it appears that the best way out of their troubles is to put the blame elsewhere," said the newspaper.
Taiwan and China have been rivals since the Nationalists fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the communists in 1949.
The United States formally recognises China but maintains trade and other unofficial ties with Taiwan.
Washington sent warships near Taiwan in a show of support when Beijing staged war games and missile tests to intimidate the island early last year.

China on Tuesday rejected Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's criticism of its proposal to abolish a series of laws in the territory after it reverts to Beijing's control, saying it was an internal affair.
Beijing also angrily reminded Britain that China was no longer a weak, pre-revolutionary government, and said it would not tolerate other countries trying to impose their will on it.
"We cannot accept Patten's so-called statement," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said, referring to the governor's criticism of plans to abolish laws on democratic elections and civil liberties in Hong Kong after the transfer of power this year.
"I want to remind the British authorities in Hong Kong that the government of China today is not the pre-1949 government," he told reporters, referring to the year of the Communist revolution.
"We cannot accept any instances of others trying to impose their will on us."
Patten had condemned a move by a China-appointed panel, known as the Preparatory Committee, to draw up a list of 25 laws and articles for repeal or amendment after the transfer of power at midnight on June 30.
After the handover, the territory that has been a British colony for more than 150 years will become a Special Administrative Region of China.
The Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Preparatory Committee had the authority to review existing Hong Kong laws to determine whether they were in conflict with the Basic Law, a mini-constitution drafted by China for the territory.
"This is entirely an internal matter for China," he said.
Shen also tried to play down the impact of the proposals, saying there basically would be no change to existing laws.
He called on the Hong Kong government to avoid making statements that "misled the public or undermined morale in the territory".
Patten had said the proposals, made at a committee meeting in Beijing on Sunday, struck at the heart of Hong Kong's civil liberties and appeared to be politically motivated rather than reflecting real inconsistencies with the Basic Law.
Among the laws to be diluted are Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, a 1992 election law, the Societies Ordinance which permits the formation of political parties and a 1995 Public Order Ordinance which allows peaceful demonstrations.
"Those laws which conflict with the Basic Law cannot continue as laws of the Special Administrative Region," Shen said.
He said that if the Preparatory Committee recommended the revision or abolition of these laws, it was reasonable and in the interests of a smooth transfer of power.
The spokesman also dismissed as groundless concerns over the independence of the judicial system under Chinese rule.

China's central bank, stung by the collapse of a major trust company, is looking warily at the nation's financial system, warning of dangers to Beijing's prestige and social stability.
The failure of the China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC) because of "serious illegal and irregular practices" was deeply embarrassing for China's financial regulators, bankers said.
But it was a vindication of sorts for those who have been trying to make the People's Bank of China more like its Western counterparts, boosting the central bank's ability to detect problems in the financial sector, they said.
That eventually could help to give it more independence from the nation's political decision-makers, bankers said.
Under a three-year, World Bank-sponsored programme, the central bank enlisted the help of big accounting firm Price Waterhouse to strengthen its accounting and supervisory abilities.
"They (central bank officials) recognised they had to improve the quality of the information they had," said J. Thomas Macy, who headed up the Price Waterhouse team working with the central bank.
"You can't make good decisions if you don't have good data," he told Reuters in an interview.
LOANS OFTEN NOT REPAID
The People's Bank of China was once seen as merely the financial arm of the government, ensuring that money allocated for lending went to the right place. Whether borrowers ever repaid was less important.
China's four, main state-run banks have a combined 134,000 branches and each branch reported to the central bank independently. That gave the central bank a huge flow of uncoordinated and often not very useful information.
A Western diplomat who viewed such reports piled up at the central bank said he asked a bank employee several years ago what the central bank did with the data and was told earnestly: "We add the numbers up."
"The data gave no idea of the state of health of the financial system," said Price Waterhouse's Macy.
That is clearly changing.
A computer system was designed for the bank's reporting purposes and a risk-based aproach to financial examination is being introduced.
Macy said an 800-page examination manual would be given to some 10,000 bank examiners.
CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENS GRIP ON SECTOR
Chinese bankers say the central bank is already tightening its grip on the financial system.
"They are checking much more closely now," said a Chinese banker in Shenzhen near Hong Kong. "They are keeping a close eye on the commercial banks."
Many foreign bankers agree there has been a marked change.
"The data collected is getting much better," said a Japanese banker.
"But more work on technical inspections is needed to bring them (central bank operations) up to international levels," he said.
Others argue that such skills are not learned overnight.
Bankers said problems similar to those that forced the closure of CADTIC this month still lurk elsewhere in the financial sector. Smaller trust companies set up by regional or local governments are particularly vulnerable.
CENTRAL BANK SOUNDS ALARM BUT LACKS INDEPENDENCE
Central bankers have been sounding the alarm over financial risk, bringing up the theme repeatedly at a recent national banking conference.
They pushed home the need for a separation of trust companies -- like CADTIC -- from banks so that banks and their depositors would be insulated from problems at trust firms.
They also made their case for keeping bank funds out of the volatile stock and futures markets.
If the central bank can demonstrate that it has taken charge of financial supervision it might find it has more room to manoeuvre in the policy-making area, bankers said.
Economic issues such as money supply targets -- or even the decision to let foreign banks conduct local currency business -- are highly politicised in China. The central bank ultimately must listen to the views of the State Council, or cabinet.
While this may be politically necessary now, bankers said they would like to see the government give the central bank a vote of confidence by granting it more decision-making authority.

China has made a gesture to the United States by ordering Boeing jets but it has left the door open to the aircraft maker's European rival in a thinly veiled mix of politics and commerce, analysts said on Tuesday.
They said improving Sino-U.S. ties, highlighted by the visit of U.S. Vice President Al Gore, had enabled Boeing Co to sign a pact to sell five 777s to Air China for $685 million.
But Beijing was holding back orders for planes it clearly needed, keeping a close eye on the progress of Sino-U.S. ties and squeezing maximum concessions from Washington on a range of trade issues, they said.
"This is a very political game," said a foreign diplomat.
"The Chinese are moving ahead cautiously. The decisions are made by (Premier) Li Peng himself."
Diplomats said new deals for Boeing or rival Airbus Industrie could be linked to China's campaign to join the World Trade Organisation.
The United States has been the most vocal advocate of wresting further concessions from China in liberalising its domestic market before it is allowed to join the trade body.
Beijing may also be hoping to make progress in its bid to persuade Washington to grant it permanent most favoured nation trading status to avoid an annual review.
Boeing officials said they had been looking to sell 10 of their twin-engine 777s to Air China, the main Chinese international carrier.
They insisted the smaller-than-hoped-for order, delayed by more than one year by Sino-U.S. friction, was a commercial decision and they were confident of making more sales for the same type of plane in future.
China often assails the West for mixing trade and diplomacy.
But the political drama behind the Boeing deal was highlighted by the signing ceremony in the Great Hall of the People as both Gore and Premier Li looked on.
Gore is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since then-president George Bush travelled to Beijing in early 1989 -- just months before a crackdown on democracy protests in the Chinese capital's Tiananmen Square.
"Airbus will be disappointed at today's order," said a another Western diplomat.
"They were looking to sell the A330-300," a twin-engine jet that Airbus says it has not yet sold in China.
But Boeing has hardly dealt its key rival a knockout blow.
"This is not a mega-order," said an industry analyst.
The next sign of how political ties translate into contracts could emerge at the forthcoming visit by French President Jacques Chirac.
Analysts said they would watch closely to see whether new plane orders go to Airbus Industrie and how many planes were purchased.
China has said it will put in service some 240 more planes during the current five-year plan ending in the year 2000 to keep up with rising demand for domestic and international air travel. Most of those planes have yet to be ordered.
Boeing officials, quoting Chinese data, said they were well ahead in the China market so far with some 216 planes in service against 29 for Airbus.
But Boeing underwent a dry spell in 1996, notching only a handful of sales in a year in which Sino-U.S. ties were rocked by Beijing's sabre-rattling aimed at Taiwan as well as disputes over trade, arms control and human rights.
Airbus signed a pact for 30 of the Airbus A320 narrow body jets in April last year in a deal worth $1.5 billion.
Those planes compete with Boeing's smaller 737 jets.
Boeing officials said that with some of the political friction out of the way, they expect more market inroads, and note the latest deal brings this year's sales to $1.2 billion.
But analysts cautioned that despite the improvement in Sino-U.S. ties, issues between the two states were unlikely to be resolved soon and would add a political tint to future commercial deals.

With just 100 days before China regains its coveted prize of Hong Kong, Beijing has sidestepped the colony's departing British masters and made sure new local leaders know where to take their cue.
China has made clear its intention to mould the territory's politics more in its own image, mapping plans to dismantle the elected legislature and water down civil liberties laws while telling Britain that objections were pointless.
"China is firmly in charge," said a Beijing-based diplomat.
Chinese Premier Li Peng has brushed aside London's hopes of monitoring the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong after the handover, proclaiming that Beijing would implement the accord as it saw fit.
"I think this is unrealistic," Li said when asked about British plans to review the pact's implementation after the transfer of power. "After July 1, Hong Kong's sovereignty returns to China."
Under the 1984 accord, China has pledged to give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover.
Beijing has also ensured that the future administrators of the territory are firmly in its camp.
Since his selection by a group of 400 people vetted by Beijing, Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting Tung Chee-hwa has shown little enthusiasm for staking out positions differing from China's official party line.
BEIJING LIKES WHAT IT HEARS
The shipping tycoon-turned-politician, who has shuttled between Hong Kong and Beijing since he was named chief executive-designate last December, has echoed China's views on issues ranging from the territory's future legislature to civil liberties and textbook revisions.
He has also hurled barbs at Hong Kong democratic activists who have been critical of China.
Beijing has responded by showing its pleasure.
The official media have described Tung in a somewhat more flattering fashion than that reserved for the territory's current and last colonial governor, Chris Patten, who has clashed repeatedly with Beijing over his efforts to expand democratic institutions in the final years of British rule.
In a sign of official favour, cameras of China's national television lingered on Tung when he attended funeral rites last month for late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the man credited with directing the strategy that enabled Beijing to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong.
"Mr Tung knows that if he doesn't carry out Beijing's wishes, someone else will," said a Western diplomat in Beijing.
Other analysts in Beijing are willing to wait before making a judgment on Tung.
"He has to establish his credibility with the Chinese," said a foreign diplomat in Beijing who follows Hong Kong affairs.
WILL TUNG STAND UP FOR HONG KONG?
"The question is, will he stand up for Hong Kong's interests in the future?"
Some people are not so sure.
"That is the charitable assessment," said one foreign diplomat in Hong Kong.
He and other analysts suggest that Tung may be more like many of Hong Kong's business leaders who are often reluctant to confront Beijing in public, whatever the issue.
The analysts note opposition can be costly.
Jardine Matheson, one of the colony's oldest trading houses, was publicly vilified by Beijing after its directors supported political reforms proposed by Patten. It has since worked hard to mend its relationship.
Businessman Jimmy Lai printed vitriolic comments about China's premier in his Next magazine in 1994. Lai's Giordano clothing outlets ran into problems with authorities in China and he eventually sold his share in the firm.
Many businessmen would probably prefer to see their names linked to more soothing comments to Beijing's ears, such as those of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, on the contribution of China's late leader Deng Xiaoping.
An article by Li that was published prominently in the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, praised the late party patriarch, his chosen successor and the future system for Hong Kong, all making deft use of communist jargon.
But diplomats said that for political leaders such as Tung, there is a considerable risk in being perceived as too willing to speak out on behalf of Beijing.
China wants a popular leader who can rally the territory's 6.4 million people to Beijing's cause, they said.
If its interests clash with those of Hong Kong, and Tung is perceived merely as Beijing's willing tool, the future leader risks losing his still high popular support.
"China chose him because he was acceptable to many people and would do its bidding," said a diplomat. "If he loses popularity in Hong Kong, that complicates matters for Beijing."

An unemployed Taiwanese journalist on Monday doused himself with petrol aboard a Taiwan airliner and hijacked the plane to China where he requested political asylum, officials said.
The Boeing 757 airliner, carrying 150 passengers and six crew, was on its way back to Taiwan after landing safely in the southeastern city of Xiamen.
Chinese police said the suspect, identified by Taiwan as Liu Shan-chung, 45, was being held in Xiamen for questioning.
"The hijacker wants political asylum," an airport official said by telephone.
An executive of Far East Air Transport, the operator of the hijacked Taiwanese airliner, told reporters the man who forced Flight 128 to fly to China said he faced political repression in Taiwan.
"The hijacker told the captain 'I am a victim of political repression'," said Lee Yun-ning, general manager of Far East Air Transport, speaking in Taipei.
Taiwan demanded China return the suspect, saying it had the right to put him on trial.
"We have legal jurisdiction," Taiwan Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao said hours after the plane crossed the Taiwan Strait and touched down in Xiamen. "The mainland authorities should return the hijacker immediately."
Chinese officials did not say how they would deal with the suspect.
Hijacking is a capital offence but commandeering an aircraft from China's arch rival Taiwan would be determined by political considerations as well as legal guidelines, lawyers said.
China and Taiwan have been rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 when the Nationalists fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the communists.
The Taiwan airliner was on a scheduled flight from the island's southern city of Kaohsiung to Taipei when it changed course and headed for the China mainland.
Liu had doused himself with petrol and forced the pilot to change course, Taiwanese authorities said.
Liu worked briefly as a journalist for the east Taiwan newspaper Lientung Daily after being fired a year ago from Kaohsiung's The Commons Daily for discipline problems, his former employers said.
In Taiwan, Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling said four Taiwan fighters had scrambled into an escort formation and tailed the plane part of the way across the Taiwan Strait.
Taiwan defence officials decided not to intercept the flight to avoid a military "misunderstanding" with China's People's Liberation Army, a defence official told Reuters.
The last hijacking of a Taiwanese airliner to China was in May 1986, when the pilot of a Boeing 747 cargo plane owned by Taiwan's flag carrier China Airlines commandeered the jet and flew it to Guangzhou.
Beijing returned the plane and two crew members who did not want to stay in China after talks between the two rivals in Hong Kong.
China endured a rash of 12 hijackings in 1993 and 1994 by Chinese who ordered pilots to fly them to Taiwan for political asylum.
Air piracy fell off sharply after Beijing launched a major drive to improve what had been lax security at most airports.

China gave new details on Wednesday of the failed launch of a satellite aboard its Long March 3B rocket in February, confirming that the cause lay with the new generation launcher.
The report concluded that the failure of the Long March 3B was due to an electrical problem in the power module of the "inertial platform" that operated the rocket's direction controls.
"There was no electric current output from the power module in the servo-loop on the follow-up frame of the inertia platform," a spokesman for the China Great Wall Industrial Corp, which handles China's launches, quoted the report as saying.
"All other systems operated normally," the report said.
The initial report had said briefly that the problem was a failure of the rocket's inertial platform.
The Long March 3B, which was being used in a launch for the first time, veered wildly seconds after lift-off from the Xichang satellite centre in southwestern Sichuan province.
It ended its flight in a spectacular explosion that destroyed the rocket and the U.S.-made Intelsat satellite it was carrying.
The latest report said the rocket smashed into a hillside 1.85 km (1.2 miles) from the launch site.
Official reports said six people were killed and 57 injured, although a video smuggled out by an Israeli scientist showed extensive damage to buildings in the area, suggesting that the number of casualties might have been considerably higher.
The final report said that because of the severity of the explosion, no large pieces of wreckage of the satellite or the rocket remained.
The report's conclusions were drawn largely from film of the launch and data from remote testing.
China's space programme once had a reputation for dependability, but has been marred by a string of recent failures.
It suffered a blow to its hopes to capture a significant share of the commercial satellite launch market when a Long March 3 rocket failed to lift a U.S.-built satellite into proper orbit last month.
The preliminary conclusion blamed the failure on a problem with the third-stage booster of the Long March 3 rocket, which is supposed to be one of China's most reliable launch vehicles.
China has come under pressure from potential foreign customers as well as the insurance industry to disclose more information on the problems with its launches so far.
In January 1995, a Long March rocket blew up, destroying the Apstar 2 satellite and killing six people on the ground.
However, China successfully launched Hong Kong's Apstar 1A telecommunications satellite in July after delaying the launch following last February's Long March 3B explosion.

Chrysler Corp. Tuesday announced $380 million in new investments for South America, including assembly plants for pickup trucks and diesel engines in Brazil and the expansion of a Jeep plant now being built in Argentina.
Chrysler, which is cautiously trying to rebuild its international presence, said the projects in Brazil were worth about $315 million, and the expansion in Argentina was worth about $65 million.
Roughly one third of the total investment, or about $126.6 million, will come from Chrysler's suppliers, who will play a major role in the automaker's low-risk global growth strategy, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said.
"We don't intend to make risky investments just to be a major player in emerging markets," added Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president of international operations. "We're quite content to grow at a steady pace in regions where we see solid opportunities."
Eaton said the investments will boost Chrysler's sales in the Mercosur free-trade zone, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
But the company's limited production capacity will allow it only to grab a small portion of the Mercosur market away from rivals General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, he said.
"We are targeting very specific market segments," he said. "We don't have any interest or desire to offer a vehicle for every possible application."
The new Brazilian plant, which will be Chrysler's third limited-production facility in South America, will assemble the automaker's all-new Dakota compact pickup truck for sale in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the countries in the Mercosur free-trade zone.
In Argentina, Chrysler said it will add production of about 6,000 Jeep Cherokees a year at a plant now under construction in the Cordoba province. The plant is already scheduled to build about 14,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees per year starting next April, and Cherokee output will begin in 1998.
A site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll off the assembly line starting in mid-1998, Chrysler said. Production, however, will be modest, with 12,000 trucks in the first year and an ultimate capacity of 40,000 units annually. Employment will start at 400 people.
The trucks at first will be largely assembled from "complete knock-down" kits shipped from the United States, but the automaker intends to meet the Mercosur trade bloc's 60 percent local content requirement after three years.
Chrysler has not decided whether to market the Dakota under the Dodge brand name or under one of its other brands. The automaker now uses the only Jeep and Chrysler brand names outside the United States, Canada and Mexico.
The $315 million Brazil investment also includes a new diesel engine plant to be built by Detroit Diesel Corp..
The $10 million facility will supply the company's Italian-designed VM Motori four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines for use in the Brazilian Dakota as well as in Jeep models built in Argentina. Chrysler installs about 40,000 of the engines annually into minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold in Europe.
Others suppliers supporting the Chrysler by opening plants in Latin America include Dana Corp., Johnson Controls Inc., Lear Corp., Lear Corp. United Technologies Corp. and PPG Industries Inc., Chrysler executives said.
Eaton said total annual vehicle sales in the four-country Mercosur region will increase from about 2 million units currently to about 2.5 million by the end of the decade.
"We think this is a major growth area," Eaton said. "It's politically and economically a stable region, we think with particularly rising consumer buying power."
Including a small plant in Venezuela that assembles Cherokees and Neon small cars from kits, the investments announced Tuesday bring to $735 million the total financial commitments Chrysler and its suppliers have made in South America, the company said.
Chrysler stock rose 25 cents to close at $28.875 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Chrysler Corp., formalising plans to keep President Robert Lutz on its payroll past the age of 65 and develop a new generation of managers, said its board of directors named Lutz vice chairman on Thursday.
The board gave Lutz's title of president to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Eaton, who will take on more day-to-day operating duties. The chief operating officer post that Lutz also held was left vacant.
Lutz, a former Marine fighter pilot who is credited with pumping new life into Chrysler's product development process and making it the most efficient in the industry, is expected to stay on for two more years, a company spokesman said.
Chrysler's board also on Thursday took steps to boost shareholder value by increasing its share buyback programme to $2 billion from $1 billion for 1997, and hiking the annual dividend to $1.60 a share from $1.40.
The new quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share is payable Jan. 15 to stockholders of record as of Dec. 15.
Chrysler said it has now raised its dividend seven times in the past three years and has increased the payout by 433 percent since September 1993. Thursday's actions come about 10 months after the company settled a bitter fight with Las Vegas billionaire Kirk Kerkorian.
Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp., the automaker's largest single shareholder, had mounted a hostile takeover attempt of Chrysler last year, complaining the company was not doing enough to reward shareholders. A Tracinda representative could not be reached for comment Thursday.
In its personnel moves, Chrysler switched international and product development duties among two top executives considered to be in line to succeed Eaton some day, Thomas Gale and Francois Castaing.
Gale will trade his duties as head of international operations for Castaing's duties as head of engineering and product development.
Gale, who becomes executive vice president - product development, will retain his control over product design, while Castaing, who becomes executive vice president - international, will retain his control of powertrain operations.
Four other executive vice presidents did not receive job changes. But Chrysler spoksman Arthur Liebler said Gale and Castaing do not have an edge over them to be chosen as Chrysler's next chairman.
Lutz, who turns 65 in February, will report to Eaton and will focus primarily on the automaker's product development activities, and will serve as a "coach, mentor and advisor," the company said in a statement.
"As vice chairman, Bob will focus his considerable talents on the product development process ... specifically on making sure we retain our product edge well into the 21st Century," Eaton said in a statement.
"He will continue as a member of the Office of the Chairman and as a director of the Company and will continue to be involved in all major decisions," Eaton said.
Industry analysts said the moves were aimed at allowing Chrysler to continue to take advantage of Lutz' skills while not eliminating any prospective future chairmen.
"They've really kept out of a sort of hysterical concern about where people fit in the organisation -- and that might not be too bad," said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Centre for the Study of Automotive Transporation.
Cole theorised Chrysler may never hand out the president title to a rising executive, thus allowing its executive vice presidents to concentrate on their current jobs.
"What they're really doing is managing the transition from the old Chrysler to the new one," he said.

Comerica Inc. said Wednesday it will cut 1,890 jobs, or about 16 percent of its work force, as part of an effort to slash costs and boost revenues by $110 million annually by the first half of 1998.
The Detroit-based banking company said the restructuring actions caused it to incur a $90 million pretax charge against its fourth-quarter earnings, which fell to $60.8 million, or 52 cents a share, from $106.5 million, or 92 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
Comerica, with $34 billion in assets at the end of 1996, said the actual number of employees to be laid off may be less than 1,890 because of attrition, a hiring freeze and reinvestment actions.
The company has about 12,000 employees in Michigan, Texas, California and Florida. The cuts will fall in all four states and will take place between now and mid-1998, Comerica said.
"Regrettably, as we streamline processes and eliminate redundancies, a number of employees throughout the corporation will be displaced," Comerica Chairman Eugene Miller said in a statement. "To assist these employees, we have put in place an enhanced severance plan with out placement services to help their transition."
Comerica also said it planned to close about a dozen branch offices.
Comerica, Michigan's largest independent bank holding company, has been the subject of merger speculation in the past year. However, it has steadfastly maintained it is not interested in being acquired by an out-of-state bank and has instead embarked on a long effort to streamline its operations.
Comerica said the third phase of its restructuring effort includes other initiatives to reduce costs and enhance revenues. They include:
-- Eliminating one-third of paper forms and replacing them with electronic forms.
-- Simplifying the referral and delivery of investment services.
-- Giving branch employees more authority and reducing their clerical duties so they can serve customers better.
-- Reducing the documentation required to open a new account.
-- Streamlining the credit approval process.
-- Streamlining financial and operations reporting.
For the full year, Comerica earned $417.2 million, or $3.55 a share, up from $413.4 million, or $3.54 a share, in 1995.

Chrysler Corp. said on Monday it has developed a new way to extract hydrogen from gasoline that could shave 10 years off the introduction of super-efficient electric cars powered by "fuel cells."
Chrysler said the system it developed would use normal gasoline to obtain hydrogen and power a future car with a 50 percent increase in fuel efficiency over current cars.
Cars using the system would be vastly more expensive than cars with internal combustion engines. But Chrysler officials said the system could be commercially viable by 2010 to 2015.  
If the system ever makes it out of the laboratory, drivers of gasoline fuel cell cars would simply refuel at a normal gasoline station, although the car would have a smaller tank than those used today. Chrysler hopes to have a working test vehicle within three years.
"We believe hydrogen needs to be processed from gasoline on-board vehicles because hydrogen isn't a practical fuel choice today," Francois Castaing, Chrysler's vice president of vehicle engineering, said at the North American International Auto Show here  
"Simply put, there's not any filling stations supplying it to a mass market," Castaing said.
Further development of the elaborate system -- called an on-board "refinery" by Chrysler advanced technologies specialist Christopher Borroni-Bird -- faces significant hurdles. Packed with precious metal catalysts to remove harmful sulfur and carbon monoxide emissions, it would currently cost 10 times more than a conventional internal combustion engine, or about $30,000.  
Long used in spacecraft applications, fuel cells generate electricity through the chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, triggered by a platinum catalyst.
Detroit automotive engineers have studied them as a potential power source, but have scratched their heads at the problems associated with producing, distributing and storing highly volatile hydrogen fuel. The on-board "refinery" would solve that problem by extracting hydrogen from gasoline.  
"In time, we think development of this processor will help open the door to the use of fuel cells as the primary power source in a series hybrid vehicle that meets consumer demands for range and performance," Castaing said.
The first wave of modern electric vehicles from Detroit and Japan are now being introduced. They rely on batteries to provide electrical energy, but their range is severely limited.  
General Motors Corp became the industry's first automaker to introduce a new-generation vehicle, the $35,000 two-seat EV1, which can only drive 60 to 70 miles between charges.
Automakers also are tinkering with hybrid electric vehicles, which use a small internal combustion engine to drive a generator that supplies electricity to drive the wheels. The cars also use an interim storage device, such as a battery or flywheel.
Automotive engineers say the major problem with such hybrids is their high cost -- they essentially use two separate powertrains, instead of just one in conventional internal combustion cars.

General Motors Corp.'s 50.8 percent drop in fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations earnings was a disappointment long anticipated by Wall Street, but the automaker's strong cash generation has hopes raised for a strong performance in 1997.
Despite the earnings drop, GM's cash and marketable securities topped the $17 billion mark at year-end, up $2.5 billion from September 30, 1996 and up $6.8 billion from a year earlier.  
Although $1 billion of GM's fourth quarter cash increase came from a tax refund, analysts said the $1.5 billion increase in cash from strike-marred operations was impressive.
"It's a good news bad news quarter," said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. "It suggests that if 1997 is normal and largely free of strikes, it ought to be another good year for cash generation."
GM's fourth quarter North American production volume, mauled by strikes and new model launches, fell 11.4 percent, resulting in a $124 million North American loss, compared to a year earlier profit of $603 million.  
But analysts expect GM to bounce back in 1997 with new models and robust production. And as the new product benefits that management has been promising for several years materialize, GM's 1997 profits and cash flow should swell.
J.P. Morgan analyst David Bradley estimated that GM in 1997 could wind up with $28 billion in cash at the end of 1997, including about $4.5 billion from the sale of Hughes Aircraft Co to Raytheon Corp.
That's about $15 billion above GM's cash reserve target of $13 billion, and he added that GM could make up to $12 billion of that available for stock repurchases.  
"This company could have enough cash to buy back a quarter of its shares," Bradley said.
GM on Monday committed to repurchasing $2.5 billion worth of stock in the next 12 months, but GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh said the automaker wants to complete that quickly and "revisit" the stock buyback issue.
Nonetheless, GM shares fell 1-1/8 to 60-3/4, reflecting profit taking on the stock's climb from the last month, earnings that were roughly in line with expectations  and continued market disappointment that GM did not announce a bigger stock buyback program.  
"I think the disappointment of yesterday was not counterbalanced by positive surprises today," said Prudential Securities analyst Philip Fricke.
GM reported that its fourth quarter net income from continuing operations, which included a host of extraordinary items, came to $786 million, or $0.92 a share, down from $1.6 billion, or $1.95 a share, a year earlier.
The results also included weaker profits in Europe, which is plagued with a slumping market. Earnings from International Operations, long GM's standout performer, will likely be flat or declining next year, putting more pressure on GM's North American operations.
Fricke said 1997 is a "show and tell" year for that must reveal steady improvements in the automaker's vehicle profit margins.
"What will be the telling factor is whether the improvement in operating income goes way beyond what can be explained by higher production volumes," he said.
To accomplish that, GM's new cars and trucks must be a hit with consumers and help reverse the automaker's long-term slide in U.S. market share. GM ended 1996 with about 31 percent of the U.S. market, down from 32.4 percent in 1995.
"GM has to make believers out of people as far as market share goes," added Healy. "If they don't gain market share this year, I don't know if they ever will."

Automakers ended a strong 1996 with a whimper Friday, as General Motors Corp. said December U.S. car and truck sales fell nearly 14 percent and Chrysler Corp. managed a 1.1 percent sales gain for the month.
Chrysler's full-year sales of 2.45 million vehicles, however, broke the company's 1988 record, and the industry stayed on track to report full-year sales of 15.1 million cars and light trucks, matching the 1994 total that was also its best year since 1988. Automakers sold about 14.8 million cars and light trucks in the United States in 1995.
"It was a pretty good year as a whole, but it's closing on a soft note," Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said.
December sales from the 14 automakers who reported Friday ran 8.6 percent below the year-ago results, but full-year sales were up 1.8 percent. Analysts predicted that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for the month would be about 14.5 million to 14.8 million units, compared with a strong December 1995 rate of 15.9 million units.
Several Japanese automakers also reported December sales declines on Friday. Ford Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. are set to release year-end sales results on Monday.
GM's car sales fell 12.5 percent in December and normally stronger sales of GM trucks also fell a sharp 15.6 percent.
The December declines brought the auto giant's full-year 1996 vehicle sales to 4,793,169 cars and trucks, a 2.7 percent decline from the 4,895,368 units sold in 1995.
GM's sales for the year were marred by strikes that disrupted production in March, late October and early November, but analysts said car model changeovers and stiff competition in trucks also took a toll.
"I think we're past the point where you can use the strikes as an excuse," Healy said. "I think Ford and Chrysler are beginning to hurt GM in the truck area, where its products aren't fresh any more."
Still, GM said truck sales for the full year exceeded 2 million units for the first time, rising 2.8 percent over 1995.
GM marketing chief Ronald Zarrella predicted gains in both cars and trucks in 1997, fueled by new sedans, minivans and increased sport/utility vehicle producion.
"The positive reception our new-for-'97 models are receiveing from both our dealers and customers is a certain sign that the coming year will be a good one for General Motors and its dealers," Zarrella said in a statement.
GM's market share has hovered near 30 percent in recent months, continuing a steady decline over the past decade.
By contrast, Chrysler estimates that its market share increased by nearly 2 percentage points to nearly 16 percent.
Bolstered by strong sales of minivans, pickup trucks and sport/utility vehicles, Chrysler said its 1996 sales totaled 2,450,826 vehicles, up 13 percent from 1995's 2,164,343. It broke the previous annual record of 2,208,057 units, set in 1988.
Chrysler said December sales of North American-built vehicles rose 5.4 percent but light truck sales dipped 0.2 percent in the month. For the full year, Chrysler's domestic car sales rose 6.6 percent to 827,941 units while light truck sales rose 16.7 percent 1,618,193.
Chrysler's executive vice president of sales, James Holden, said Chrysler may have difficulty surpassing 1996 results this year in some months due to model changeovers. He said the industry will still need incentives to maintain its sales pace.
"I don't see a way to wean ourselves completely from rebates and incentives, but I expect to hold them to similar levels to what we've had, which have been relatively modest."
Chrysler stock rose 50 cents to $34.625 while GM fell 62.5 cents to close at $57.875, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
Among Japanese automakers, Toyota Motor Corp. said December sales fell 17.4 percent while full-year sales rose 6.4 percent to 1.16 million units.
Nissan Motor Corp.'s December sales dipped 0.2 percent and full-year sales fell 3.4 percent to 749,763 units.
Mazda Motor Corp.'s December total was off 17.2 percent while annual sales fell 16.6 percent to 238,285 units.
Germany's Volkswagen AG posted its best U.S. sales year since 1990, with sales up 17.3 percent to 135,907 cars and trucks. December sales jumped 23.5 percent.

General Motors Corp. workers overwhelmingly ratified a new labour contract, the United Auto Workers union said Monday, capping a contentious bargaining season for the Big Three U.S. automakers.
The UAW said 85 percent of the hourly and skilled workers who voted approved the three-year pact, marking the largest approval margin in 20 years.
The pact marks the end of the union's national bargaining for more than 386,000 hourly workers at GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.. While the Ford and Chrysler talks hit minor snags, negotiations at GM ignited a national strike by the Canadian Auto Workers in October and local UAW strikes at two plants that stretched into November.
GM said last week the walkouts will reduce its fourth quarter profits by some $700 million, and other costs associated with the UAW pact will cost another $170 million.
GM's UAW contract follows the pattern set by Ford and Chrysler on most issues, including a guarantee that GM will maintain employment at 95 percent of its current UAW hourly work force of 215,000 people.
All three pacts offer workers about $13,900 over the life of the agreement, including $2,000 lump-sum payments in the first year and 3 percent base wage increases in the second and third years.
But the GM pact also includes some tougher restrictions aimed at preventing the shifting of parts work to outside suppliers.
In return, the world's largest automaker gained the ability to drop below the 95 percent level when it makes productivity improvements -- a big factor given the many new car and truck models GM will introduce in the next few years.
GM also gained flexibility to transfer workers more freely between plants and retained its ability to sell some unprofitable factories. The company will proceed with plans to sell a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., GM spokesman Charles Licari said.
"We have the ability to execute our business plan," Licari said. "We have the ability to reduce employment through productivity gains and attrition."
He declined to say how many jobs GM hopes to eliminate over the life of the agreement. Analysts estimate that if GM is allowed to shrink by its normal retirement rate of about 5 percent a year, it could cut 30,000 jobs.
"We believe that it is a fair and equitable agreement that provides additional job security as well as economic and benefit enhancements for our employees while giving GM the flexibility that it needs to be more competitive in the future," Licari said.
The 85 percent approval margin for the GM contract was higher than any ratification vote since 1976, when 86.9 percent of GM's production workers and 69 percent of a smaller group of skilled workers approved the pact.
Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi said the 1996 contract should allow GM to become much more competitive than it could under the previous agreement.
"I think GM won this time around, as opposed to 1993. The key here is they have gained the ability to ride the attrition curve," he said.
But GM still faces a major hurdle in negotiating plant-level labour agreements at the vast majority of its 123 UAW locals. UAW officials have said GM could face more local strikes, and such agreements could make it more difficult to reduce employment at each individual plant.
Ford and Chrysler achieved labour peace in their agreements, but they also are likely to have some flexibility to exit certain unprofitable businesses, Phillippi said.

General Motors Corp. stock rose Friday on widening optimism that the auto giant's board of directors on Monday will reward shareholders with a dividend increase and stock buyback programme of up to $5 billion, analysts said.
GM shares were up $1.125 to $63 in composite trading after hitting a 52-week high of $63.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.
Analysts said GM, flying high a week after it announced the sale of its Hughes Aircraft defence operations to Raytheon Corp. in a deal worth $9.5 billion, was working to catch up with rivals Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in returning cash to shareholders.
"I think GM is looking at this rightly. It's time to pay the shareholders for their patience," said CS First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas. "They want to hand some cash back to shareholders who have been long waiting on the suffering side."
GM spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said GM was scheduled to consider its dividend at the board meeting, but would not comment on a possible increase or stock buyback programme.
The automaker could have afforded such a move last fall, but analysts said it did not want a big payoff to shareholders throwing a wrench into tense contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union.
Analysts estimated that the board, which holds its regularly scheduled board meeting for February on Monday, will increase the quarterly dividend by 10 cents to 20 cents a share and announce $2 billion to $3 billion in stock repurchases this year. GM now pays a quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share.
Colas said his estimate that GM will buyback $3 billion worth of stock this year was based on expectations that GM ended 1996 with $15 billion in cash, $3 billion above its target of $12 billion.
He noted that Chrysler, less than a third of GM's size, plans to repurchase $2 billion worth of shares in 1997. Chrysler's buyback programme has put a floor under the automaker's stock, allowing it to outperform its rivals.
Smith Barney analyst David Garrity said the board could authorise as much as $5 billion in repurchases over a longer period of time.
GM's dividend hike will be aimed at improving the automakers dividend yield to competitive levels, analysts said. It now is at 2.59 percent, compared with 4.56 percent for Ford and 4.57 percent for Chrysler.
A regular share repurchase programme also would lend stability to GM's share price and help it sustain its recent gains, analysts say.
In the past month alone, GM shares have risen about 15 percent, from about $55 a share, largely on anticipation of the Hughes deal, news that it settled its industrial espionage dispute with Volkswagen AG and expectations of strong cash flow.
"They've packed an awful lot of good news into a short period of time," Bear Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Nicholas Lobaccaro said. "They've accomplished the goal of getting the stock price up, and now the challenge is to sustain it. That can only get done through consistent earnings for several quarters."
The euphoria over the Hughes deal has overshadowed GM's fourth quarter earnings, which are expected to show the ravages of lower production due to strikes and model launches.
GM has said U.S. and Canadian strikes in October and November reduced its fourth quarter results by $700 million. The automaker also is taking a $170 million charge for lump-sum payments associated with its new United Auto Workers contract.
According to consensus Wall Street estimates, GM on Tuesday is expected to post fourth quarter earnings of about $385 million, or 51 cents a share, which excludes the $170 million charge.
In the fourth quarter of 1995, GM earned a record $1.9 billion, or $1.98 a share, a figure helped by about $577 million worth of tax benefits.

General Motors Corp.'s move to deflate Wall Street expectations about its fourth-quarter earnings will not likely be repeated by rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. analysts said Thursday.
GM told analysts Wednesday that its fourth-quarter North American incentive and other marketing costs were higher than earlier estimates, causing analysts to slash their estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars.
The automaker also said its product mix in Europe will be weaker than expected, with the low-margin Corsa subcompact making up a bigger portion of sales, and new product launch costs remain high.
As a result, many analysts slashed their estimates by 45 cents to 50 cents a share, helping to drive down GM stock by $1.375 over the past two days, to close at $54.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Burnham Securities analyst David Healy now estimates that GM will earn $435 million, or 52 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, excluding extraordinary items.
Among other items, GM plans to take a charge of $170 million, or 22 cents a share, to make lump-sum payments to United Auto Workers members as part of the company's new contract with the union.
GM also previously disclosed that strikes in the United States and Canada during the quarter reduced its fourth-quarter profit by about $700 million. In the fourth quarter of 1995, GM earned $1.87 billion, or $1.98 a share.
Analyst Michael Ward of brokerage PaineWebber Inc. said GM appears to be viewing the fourth quarter as a "cleanup quarter" and may accelerate some costs to help improve next year's results.
But analysts did not expect Ford and Chrysler to reveal similar surprises with marketing costs.
"Both Ford and Chrysler are more heavily weighted toward trucks," said brokerage A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons analyst Michael Braig. "I don't know that I have to get any more sceptical than I have already been with them."
Ford could earn as much as $1.25 billion, or $1.03 a share, in the fourth quarter before extraordinary items, according to a consensus estimate by First Call Corp., which tracks analyst forecasts. That total excludes an expected charge of $400 million, or 34 cents a share, to cover costs of an early retirement programme for salaried workers.
In the fourth quarter of 1995, new product launch costs held Ford's profit to $660 million, or 48 cents a share.
Although Ford continues to struggle with problems in Europe and Brazil, it is reaping benefits in North America from its new F-150 pickup truck, the new Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle and continued strong sales of the Explorer sport utility.
Ford said Thursday it sold 2 million trucks in a single year for the first time ever, including 800,000 F-Series trucks.
Lehman Brothers brokerage analyst Joseph Phillippi said Ford may announce another onetime charge for restructuring its European operations in the fourth quarter. Ford officials have declined to discuss plans for specific cost-cutting actions in Europe, but expect such actions to pay off in 1997.
Chrysler, which is enjoying a record sales year, is expected to cruise to a fourth-quarter profit of more than $1 billion, or about $1.40 a share, according to First Call. Driving the Chrysler earnings are strong sales of minivans, pickup trucks, and sport utility vehicles.
Chrysler chief economist Van Bussmann said Thursday that the automaker's market share, now at about 16 percent vs. 12 percent five years ago, should grow further in 1997. The automaker is introducing a new generation of large sedans and a new Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle based on its new Dakota pickup truck.

General Motors Corp. was expected to seek bids for its Hughes Electronics Corp. defence businesses in the first of several transactions aimed at shedding GM's remaining non-automotive assets, analysts said Thursday.
The possible sale of Hughes' defence operations for as much as $8 billion was the latest of several scenarios that have emerged in recent months regarding GM's plans for Hughes, which it bought in 1985 for about $5 billion.
"I think the GM board and Hughes Electronics management are very interested in divesting the defence business, merging the Delco Electronics unit with the Delphi components business, and spinning off the communications business into a separate company," said CS First Boston defence analyst Peter Aseritis.
"My sense is that they want to find a merger partner for the defence business first," he added.
Analysts said several candidates could be interested in Hughes' defence units, including McDonnell Douglas Corp., Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp.
GM declined to comment on the idea of splitting off the defence business, first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
"I have to classify it all in the realm of speculation, for which we have no comment," said GM spokeswoman Toni Simmonetti in New York.
However, GM disclosed in recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings that Hughes wants to "strengthen its leadership position through acquisitions, consolidations, realignments and divestitures," among other actions.
Hughes' missile systems, radar, electronic warfare, thermal imaging, information systems and other defence units, which earned operating profits of $688 million on revenues of $5.95 billion in 1995, are regarded as attractive plums in a consolidating defence industry.
McDonnell Douglas, which many analysts said was ready for an acquisition, declined to confirm any specific bidding activity, but said it was interested in Hughes. McDonnell President Harry Stonecipher "has gone on record saying that he is interested in making an acquisition. He finds Hughes an interesting choice," a McDonnell spokeswoman said.
But analysts cautioned that any transaction involving Hughes would be complicated, because of tax considerations for GM and its Class H shareholders.
Under a complex ownership structure, shareholders of GM Class H stock are entitled to dividends based on Hughes' earnings while GM owns the subsidiary's assets. Thus an outrightright sale would create a major tax liability for GM.
For that reason, analysts said GM was more likely to pursue a non-cash transaction, such as a stock swap or other type of deal that could take some time to structure.
"Clearly I would personally be surprised if there was an outright sale," said BT Securities analyst Wolfgang Demisch.
A sale of the defence business would clear the way for GM to fold its Delco Electronics unit, which makes audio systems and other components, back into its Delphi Automotive Systems auto parts unit.
That would leave Hughes' lucrative telecommunications and space segment, which has been soaring on the growth of its DirecTV satellite broadcasting service. Those operations may be spun off into a separate company, analysts said.

Congress is gearing up to try and make changes to the way the government auctions the airwaves, following a recent sale that fell flat and a new Justice Department investigation into possible bid-rigging.
Lawmakers said Thursday they are eyeing bills or offering legislation to maximize the money the federal government raises through spectrum sales. That comes after some wireless communications licenses auctioned last week feteched just $1 apiece, and the antitrust probe put a further tarnish on the sales.
Bills being offered would set minimum bidding levels or slow the flow of airwave slices into the market by holding federal auctions only at selected intervals. The Clinton administration is studying the measures.
Congress has relied heavily on the Federal Communications Commission auctions as a one-time way to help cut the deficit. "We had a great success with the early auctions that raised over $23 billion. But it became like candy. And the budgeteers just couldn't put it down," Representative Mike Oxley, an Ohio Republican who first introduced auction legislation in 1993, said in an interview.
"At the very least, we ought to have some hearings and try to educate members (of Congress), the public, and particularly the budgeteers, that they're really playing with fire here." Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who chairs the commerce committee, wants the FCC to pay "more attention to the market forces" when it auctions spectrum for uses ranging from a new generation of cellular phones to satellite television.
"The last thing we want to do is have a distortion of the marketplace which would then cost people involved in the free enterprise system and the taxpayers," he said in an interview. McCain is preparing to offer a bill to keep spectrum from being dumped on the market.
But some analysts are wary of tinkering with the process. "The idea that Congress can figure whether there's too much or too little spectrum -- or the right price -- I find arrogant and presumptuous," said Bill Bane, director at Mercer Management Consulting Inc.
The importance of airwave sales to the budget process was driven home by last week's disappointing auction. The sale -- for a piece of spectrum that will let users gain access to the Internet or create wireless local telephone networks -- raised just $13.6 million. That was a far cry from the $1.8 billion Congress was counting on to cut the deficit. FCC officials blamed the results on lawmakers' requirement to hold the auction by mid-April and to end it in time to help reduce red ink in the current 1997 fiscal year. They said companies did not have enough time to develop business plans.
"This was a good example of one that was ordered prematurely," Representative W. J. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee, said in an interview.
    "It's a problem that has to do with our budgeteers ordering auctions that may be inappropriate, not with the auction process itself," added the Louisiana Republican.     Sen. Robert Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, offered a bill this week to set a minimum price for each airwave parcel sold. "With a reserve pricing system, taxpayers will be guaranteed that national assets are not sold for a song," he said.
    Meanwhile, lawmakers are in no hurry to offer bills in response to the Justice Department probe of possible bid-rigging at auctions for advanced cellular-phone licenses. But the news put a further spotlight on the auctions.     "This whole topic of spectrum auctions has become -- crazily enough -- kind of sexy," quipped House Commerce Committee aide Dennis Fitzgibbons.

The Clinton administration Thursday threw its support behind legislation to prevent state and local governments from slapping new taxes on the Internet, giving a boost to a bill opposed by state and local officials.
The bill would impose an indefinite moritorium during which state and local governments could not tax the Internet, companies that provide access to the global computer netowrk, as well as electronic commerce conducted in cyberspace.
The legislation -- introduced in the House and the Senate -- would not affect existing taxes on goods and services ordered through the Internet, as long as the taxes are the same as those on mail-order transactions.
The moratorium is intended to give the Clinton administration time to develop a broad plan to address the issue of taxes on electronic commerce.
"Treasury wholeheartedly supports the goals and underlying objectives of the Internet Tax Freedom Act," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications.
"Unreasonable taxation of the Internet, or even the fear of unreasonable taxation, could be a significant impediment to the growth of the Internet and electronic commerce."
But state and local officials said the bill would intrude on their powers and create budget problems.
"We believe that an indefinite moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet or on-line services would be a significant infringement on state and local sovereignty, create considerable budgetary problems for local governments and lead to unfair competition in the marketplace," said Timothy Kaine, a council member from Richmond, Va., who spoke on behalf of a variety of state and local organizations.
The National Governors Association also opposes the bill.
Key lawmakers in both houses of Congress have signaled a willingness to move quickly on the legislation.
The bill comes as state and local tax collectors have been eyeing the rapidly growing Internet computer network as a source of revenue to bolster their coffers.
Some states already are imposing taxes on companies that link consumers or businesses to the Internet, or that offer computer bulletin boards and electronic mail.
In Microsoft Corp.'s home state of Washington last year, the city of Tacoma decided to impose a six percent tax on companies that link residents to the Internet. But the city council later voted to repeal the plan.
"The present pattern of taxes on electronic commerce can best be described as a crazy quilt. The Internet may be the new frontier, but the way it's taxed looks like Dodge City before the marshals showed up," said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is sponsoring the bill.
Added the bill's sponsor in the House, Rep. Christopher Cox, a California Republican: "That taxes might drive the Internet to an early grave is not hyperbole, but a very real possibility."

The Justice Department is investigating possible bid-rigging during airwaves auctions held by the federal government for wireless phone licenses.
Justice Department documents obtained by Reuters Wednesday showed the department's antitrust division also was looking into whether bidders schemed illegally to divvy up the licenses being sold.
The Federal Communications Commission has raised more than $20 billion since 1995 by selling licenses to companies offering a new generation of cellular phone service known as "personal communications services," or PCS.
A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the investigation. She said the antitrust division was "looking into the possibility of anti-competitive conduct by bidders in connection with the FCC's auctioning of spectrum for PCS."
She declined to specify which auctions were being investigated or provide additional details.
The department documents focus on the PCS auction that ended in mid-January and raised $2.5 billion.
At that auction, the FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making it the most licenses sold at once. A third of the licenses were reserved for small companies.
Top bidders were units of Sprint Corp., AT&amp;T Corp. and BellSouth Corp.
A spokesman for BellSouth said the company had not been informed by the government of any investigation. It was not immediately known whether the other two companies were targets or had been contacted regarding the probe.
An attorney familiar with the investigation said the department has sent out "numerous" letters requesting information and documents from auction participants.
The "civil investigative demand" seeks information about companies' bids, their bidding strategies and communications about the auction with other telecommunications firms.
In a sign that the investigation was looking into the possibility of bid "signaling" among participants, the department requested documents showing the last three digits of company bids.
One attorney familiar with the investigation said it was evident during the bidding that companies used the last three digits of their dollar bidding figure to signal their intentions to other auction participants.
"It's clear a certain amount of this was taking place," said the attorney, who spoke on condition of not being identified.

Regulators Monday approved long-delayed plans to auction two airwave licenses to create new nationwide radio services that will be beamed coast-to-coast via satellite and offer CD-quality reception.
The Federal Communications Commission, in resolving a long-standing dispute among its four comissioners, said it will limit the April 1 sale to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital audio radio -- instead of opening the auction to any company.
The four are: CD Radio Inc. of Washington, D.C.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston, Va.; Digital Broadcast Satellite Corp. of Seattle; and Primosphere LP of New York.
To receive the new service, listeners will have to buy a special radio receiver that will cost about $200, in addition to the price of a regular radio, according to industry estimates.
It is likely the new service will be subscription-based, with an expected cost of about $10 a month. Operators will be able to offer specialised programming.
CD Radio, which pioneered the digital radio concept, plans to provide 30 channels of commercial-free music programming if it wins one of the two licenses up for grabs.
The company would target persons who drive a lot or live in rural areas and do not have access to many radio stations.
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt and Commissioner Susan Ness had favoured opening the auction of the licenses to any bidders, instead of limiting it to the four.
But they were unable to get the other two commissioners at the FCC -- Rachelle Chong and James Quello -- to agree.
"I would prefer to assign spectrum licenses through an auction open to all. Closing the auction is the wrong result," Hundt said in a statement.
An open auction could have raised a larger sum for the government by attracting more deep-pocketed bidders.
Hundt noted recently that MCI Communications Corp. last year paid $683 million to win the last remaining satellite slot to beam television programmes nationwide.
The commissioners, in resolving another dispute, agreed to require the license winners to offer discounted advertising rates and equal time to political candidates running for federal office.
The agency also told the applicants that the winners could be subject to other public-interest obligations in the future.
The FCC is ready to unveil plans to auction a separate valuable airwave slice that will be home to a wireless technology that could offer new competition to local phone companies and cable-television operators.
A government official said the FCC plans to announce soon its long-awaited auction plans for local multipoint distribution service, or LMDS, a wireless technology that allows users to zap voice, pictures and data over high-speed networks that also can hook up to the Internet.
"All the issues have been resolved," said the official.
The FCC is expected to bar local carriers and cable firms from bidding for LMDS licenses in their home territories in a bid to bar them from snuffing out potential competition.

The judge who oversaw the dismantling of the old Ma Bell is worried that a corporate marriage involving the new AT&amp;T Corp. could create the kind of "monolith" the historic breakup was supposed to do away with.
Federal Judge Harold Greene in 1982 ordered that the Bell system monopoly be split up. For more than a decade he then presided over the consent agreement that created the seven regional Baby Bell phone companies and the new AT&amp;T, the nation's No. 1 long-distance carrier.
AT&amp;T now is in talks to merge with SBC Communications Inc. -- currently the largest provider of local phone service -- in what would be an estimated $50 billion-plus transaction. It would by far and away be the biggest such deal in history.
"The basic assumption of the breakup was that you couldn't have competition, fair competition, as long as there was this massive company that encompassed all areas of the country and all types of service," Judge Greene told Reuters.
"And the same theory that led to the breakup," he added, "could lead one to be suspicious at least of the reemergence of the same monolith."
Judge Greene -- now more of an observer of the telecom business rather than an overseer -- frets that market conditions have not changed that much since the breakup of the Bell monopoly and the consent decree that took effect in 1984. The decree set limits on how the phone industry operated.
He believes competition has yet to take full root, despite last year's telecommunications act that tore down decades-old barriers and let the local and long-distance phone companies and cable-television operators enter each other's business.
"There are lots of things that need to be done yet -- both to get the long-distance companies into local service, and local companies into long-distance service. Nothing is perfected yet," Judge Greene said.
"It seems kind of surprising that they would now reconstitute the AT&amp;T empire, at least in one part," he added.
"I would hope that regulators -- the Federal Communications Commission and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice -- will be very cautious in approving something like that.
Judge Greene's policing duties in the telecom business ended with the new communications act. Since the law's passage, there has been an explosion in merger activity.
SBC recently acquired former Baby Bell Pacific Telesis Group. Bell Atlantic Corp. is in the process of acquiring NYNEX Corp. And British Telecommunications Plc is in the midst of buying No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp.
It's reported that a merger of AT&amp;T and San Antonio, Texas-based SBC would have combined revenues of some $80 billion and a workforce of 240,000.
SBC's regional phone system includes California and Texas, following the carrier's purchase of PacTel.
"I'm surprised that somebody wants to put Humpty Dumpty back together," said Judge Green, adding that any new corporate monolith would run counter to the intent of the new telecom law.
"Certainly I think it was the spirit of the act that there not be a return to monopoly conditions," he said.

Regulators Tuesday began auctioning a slice of spectrum that will let users gain access to the Internet over the airwaves or create wireless local phone networks that compete with traditional wired networks.
Twenty-four companies -- including units of BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, Comcast Corp. and a Bell Atlantic Corp./Nynex Corp. joint venture -- are bidding for the rights to offer "wireless communications service," or WCS.
The first day of bidding in the multi-day sale totalled $5.3 million. Analysts said recent financial problems among wireless carriers will put downward pressure on prices. It is the Federal Communication Commission's 14th airwave sale.
"I expect prices to go very low for this type of spectrum," said Elliott Hamilton, analyst at Strategis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm.
The FCC is auctioning 128 licenses. Of that total, 104 are 10 megahertz licenses that roughly cover state-wide areas. The remaining 24 permits are for 5 MHz of spectrum and cover larger regional areas.
The FCC is not dictating what services companies can offer over this portion of the spectrum.
Potential applications include broadband wireless access to the Internet, wireless local phone networks, and location services for pinpointing trucks and other vehicles.
The value of wireless spectrum has fallen after last year's $10.2 billion auction of licenses for a new generation of cellular phones known as "personal communications services," or PCS.
Edward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine, said FCC officials "should be ecstatic" if the agency can net $2 billion from the lastest auction.
Several top bidders at the PCS sale are under financial strain after bidding high prices. Wall Street has been reluctant to invest in the ventures.
Also, FCC officials doubt wireless service providers can offer anytime soon the kind of mobile phone service available through PCS.
FCC officials cite restrictions on the use of the wireless service airwaves that are meant to prevent interference among users of an upcoming digital radio service that will be broadcast coast-to-coast via satellite. The wireless service and digital radio airwaves are adjacent to one another.
The FCC has raised some $23 billion through its airwave sales. But the financial problems among last year's PCS winners has raised doubts over whether the government will ever collect all the money it is owed.

Regulators Wednesday approved a sweeping overhaul of domestic telephone charges that they said will lower costs for residential and business customers who make a lot of long-distance calls.
Federal Communications Commimssion officials said basic local phone rates will stay the same. But consumers and businesses will pay more for extra phone lines and may see their bills rise if they make few long-distance calls.
The FCC also voted to set aside about $2.3 billion a year to wire the nation's schools and libraries to the Internet at discounted rates. Another $400 million a year will be used to connect rural hospitals to the global computer network.
The new rates mean residential customers with one phone line will see their long-distance bill drop to $20.65 a month from $22.50 by 1998, on average, according to FCC calculations.
"This is the single best day that business and residential customers have had since the (1984) breakup of AT&amp;T," said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.
The overhaul also will:
-- Keep the monthly "subscriber line charge" customers pay to the local phone company at $3.50.
-- Boost the line charge for residential customers with more than one line to $5 a month from $3.50, and to more than $7.50 from $6 for multi-line businesses. Those increases will take effect next year and be followed by additional rises that ultimately will be capped at $9.
-- Impose a new monthly charge on long-distance carriers that is expected to be passed on to customers. The charge will be $1.50 a line for multi-line residential customers and $2.75 a line for businesses with more than one line.
-- Reduce by $1.7 billion the $23 billion in annual charges long-distance carriers pay local companies to access their networks, effective July 1.
-- Reduce access charges by a total of $18.5 billion over the next five years.
AT&amp;T Corp. has promised to pass on the savings in access charges to customers through long-distance price cuts of 5 percent to 15 percent. Other long-distance carriers have signalled they will follow suit.
Phone companies gave the rate overhaul mixed ratings.
AT&amp;T generally praised the plan, but No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI Communications Corp. said the access charge reductions did not go far enough.
Regional phone compannies Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp., which are merging, questioned the access-charge rate cut.
Industry analysts, meanwhile, also offered mixed views.
"There was a lot of huffing and puffing, but this is incremental change and not revolutionary change," said Scott Cleland of Schwab Research Group.

Regulators will host an auction Tuesday that supporters promise will usher in a new breed of nationwide radio service but critics charge may cost U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars in lost revenue.
Up for grabs are two licenses to provide radio programming that will be beamed coast-to-coast via satellite. Digital radio will offer listeners CD-quality sound and specialised programming that can be tuned in anywhere in the nation.
"Americans will be able to travel anywhere in the country, including remote rural areas where radio reception is poor, and enjoy the same high-quality audio and wide selection of programmes the entire trip," said William Caldwell, president of Seattle-based Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corp., one of the bidders at the Federal Communications Commission sale.
The FCC resolved a long-standing dispute among its four commissioners in early March by limiting the auction to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital radio.
Two of the commissioners -- Chairman Reed Hundt and Susan Ness -- favoured opening the sale to any company wanting to bid. But in the end they agreed reluctantly to limit the auction so the launch of digital radio would not be delayed further.
"The decision to keep the auction door closed may needlessly cost the public millions of dollars," Hundt said when the agency announced its decision.
Hundt said that if other companies value the digital radio airwaves but are "arbitrarily excluded from the auction, it is safe to predict that the auction winners will simply sell their licenses to those companies."
Aside from DBSC, the other three bidders are: CD Radio Inc. of Washington, D.C.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston, Va.; and Primosphere LP of New York.
Commissioner Rachelle Chong contended that opening the bidding would have been unfair to the four.
"These applicants have been ready and willing to move forward for some time. The have expended considerable rsources in developing this technology," she said, adding that the first application was filed seven years ago.
Digital radio is unlikely to be on the air for at least three years -- if not longer -- owing to the time it takes to get satellites built and deployed into orbit.
The service will probably be subscription-based, with an expected cost of about $10 a month. Listeners will have to buy a special radio receiver that will cost about $200, on top of the price of a regular radio.
The credit-card sized satellite antenna could be installed in cars, trucks and homes.
If it wins a license, DBSC plans to deliver regional programming throughout the country. It would offer, among other things, children's programming, foreign-language, classical music, opera, all-news, all-sport and educational programmes to targeted demographic groups.
The programming would be offered as an advertising-supported service and as a commercial-free subscription service.

A year after the ValuJet Inc. crash, the top airline regulator suggested Thursday it would be impractical to force air carriers to install fire-safety equipment in passenger cargo holds in less than three years.
Under fire for not moving more quickly to promote airline safety, the Federal Aviation Administration plans next month to propose the installation of smoke detectors and fire suppressors in all passenger cargo holds over three years.
House lawmakers, however, accused the agency of dragging its feet on the installation issue, despite years of warnings from safety regulators on the need to do so. Lawmakers raised the possibility of a speedier timetable.
"It could be done in a very short period of time if we want to ground the fleet," Barry Valentine, acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told a House panel.
"That's the decision. How much disruption do we citizens want to have in our air transportation," he said.
But Representative John Fox, a Pennsylvania Republican, responded, "I think we want to have as safe as flights as possible. And if they have to be a little slower, the public probably would like them to be a little slower."
Airline executives on Wednesday announced plans to place both smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in their aircraft, after initially balking at the dual requirement.
FAA officials came under attack at the hearing -- from both lawmakers and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board -- for not moving more aggressively to implement new safety rules in the wake of the ValuJet crash.
"This is pathetic. The FAA is pathetic. The industry is pathetic," said Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat. "Any more needless deaths and we're going to crucify you."
The FAA announced six months ago plans to issue the fire-safety equipment rules, which will affect about 3,000 aircraft. But it has yet to unveil a formal proposal.
"Six months from now are we going to come back and be in the same situation that we're in today? Or is there really going to be improvement this time?" asked Representative John Duncan, a Tennessee Republican who heads the transporation subcommittee.
Valentine responded that in six months the rules would be in the "final assembly."
ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades last May, killing 110 people, because of a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. Regulators have since banned their transport on commercial airliners.
The head of the NTSB disclosed this week, however, that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident.
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall also complained at the hearing that the FAA had been slow to inform his agency of the Continental incident. Hall said it was reported to the FAA on April 24.
"It did not come to the attention of our agency until this week. You would think that in light of the ValuJet accident that if someone knew that something like this had taken place, that that information would be extremely important to the flying public of the United States," Hall said.
An FAA spokesman later said the FAA is under no requirement to forward such information to the NTSB.

British soldiers fought their way through jungle, attacked an enemy camp and took prisoners in Hong Kong on Tuesday, but it was only a mock battle and the last such exercise by the army after 156 years of colonial rule.
With only 70 days left before Britain hands Hong Kong back to China, the Black Watch regiment headed to the hills of the New Territories to play jungle war games and ignore, for a few hours, the fast-approaching end of British rule.
Shots ripped through the air and red flares spewed smoke as sweat-drenched soldiers laden with gear waded across rivers, charged up and down hills and crawled through lush and heavy undergrowth in a practice assault on an enemy camp.
The Black Watch -- dubbed the "Highland Furies" by the French after the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 -- are nearly half-way through an historic tour of duty in Hong Kong.
On June 30, the pipes and drums of the regiment will sound the end of British colonial rule.
But on Tuesday, sweat and slog rather than ceremony was the order of the day.
The camp and two prisoners-of-war were successfully taken, marking the end to the British army's permanent access to a valued training ground for jungle warfare skills.
"I'll miss it. We'll miss it, because you don't get training like this on a regular basis on a tour," said Corporal John Lyon, 28. "This area you can train throughout the whole time you're here."
Lieutenant-Colonel Alasdair Loudon, commanding officer of the Black Watch in Hong Kong, said the New Territories have become something of a secret weapon.
Few would guess that less than one-hour's drive from the concrete jungle of Hong Kong Island lie stretches of hot, humid and heavily overgrown countryside which represents a challenge for British troops.
"For us, it's harsh terrain. We're not used to the heat, we're not used to the hills and when you get away from tracks the undergrowth is very difficult. So it's demanding," he said.
The Black Watch also had a busy day on Monday -- they were escorting an advance party of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers as they drove from the border to the Prince of Wales barracks in the territory's Central business district.
The 40-strong PLA party are to lay the ground for up to 10,000 Chinese troops likely to be stationed in Hong Kong after the handover.
Loudon said his regiment's main task as June 30 approaches is to ensure the handover goes smoothly.
"Our most important task is to get out on June 30 and have a fine parade so that the handover of British sovereignty has gone in a smooth and dignified way," he told reporters.
At least 100 of the Black Watch soldiers will be involved in the ceremonies with another 100 providing logistical support. The regiment flies back to Inverness in northern Scotland after the ceremonies.
"To a man, they will have had a very interesting time here. They will have done some good training, they've done a good job," Loudon said.
"And I'm sure when they get back to Inverness, where it's warm only two days a year, they're going to miss Hong Kong very much," he said.

After July 1, Hong Kong's role as facilitator of China-Taiwan trade will continue and probably expand, but the territory's reversion to mainland rule is bound to heighten sensitivities between the "two Chinas", experts say.
"I don't think after the first of July we will see a negative effect on triangular trade (between Hong Kong, Taiwan and China) but some of the issues, their handling will become much more sensitive," said George Leung, economic adviser at Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp.
Direct trade and investment between two of Asia's largest and most vibrant economies have been banned for 48 years, creating a lucrative opportunity for Hong Kong to act as the gateway for indirect Taiwan-China trade and investment.
The ban on direct business, transport and communication links dates from 1949, when China's Communists won the civil war on the mainland and the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan, but the rivals' interest in indirect economic ties has overcome the political tensions -- to Hong Kong's benefit.
Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty, set for midnight on June 30, at first seemed to threaten a delicate but workable arrangement. But experts say the "one country, two systems" policy guiding Hong Kong's transition -- and intended by China as the model for Taiwan reunification -- has allowed the continuation of an important triangular trade relationship.
Under this policy, Hong Kong will remain a separate customs territory, reflecting Beijing's promise of a high degree of autonomy as enshrined in Hong Kong's new mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
China and Taiwan also recently sealed a pact that lessens any diplomatic nervousness about Taiwanese and Chinese vessels moving through each other's waters.
After the handover, Taiwanese vessels will remove all flags in Hong Kong waters while Hong Kong ships visiting Taiwan will fly only the flag of the new Special Administrative Region.
"I don't see any particular problem, both the Chinese and Taiwanese governments recognise the economic benefit they both derive from trade linkage," Leung said.
"And the past offers lots of examples that no matter how strained the relationship seemed to be, it had very little impact on economic ties...They argue on the political issues but never on economics."
Experts said the greatest harbinger of change for Greater China trade is not Hong Kong's handover but last January's agreement on direct shipping links between China and Taiwan.
Less than one year after the March 1996 Taiwan Straits missile crisis -- an incident that damaged trade throughout the region and pressured economic growth in Hong Kong -- shipping executives agreed to start direct cross-strait shipping between Xiamen and Fuzhou in China and Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
"Everyone's worried about those sorts of developments. Shipping, aircraft, everything comes through here," said Ian Perkin, economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
The shipping deal followed a June 1996 air accord which set up a "genuine interaction" between Taiwan, Hong Kong and China through the establishment of Taiwan-Hong Kong air routes.
The deal effectively granted a carrier controlled by communist China unprecedented access to Taiwan.
Michael Martin, assistant economist at Hong Kong's Trade Development Council, said the volume of goods involved in the first shipping deal agreed to last week was too small to have much of an impact, but any broader deal would affect Hong Kong greatly.
"If there were a change such that Taiwan and mainland China were to come up with a new agreement that would allow goods directly from Taiwan to China or the other way, that's a new ballgame. We're talking about a larger volume of goods or products," Martin said.
Hong Kong exports to Taiwan were valued at US$4.2 billion in 1996 with Taiwanese imports to Hong Kong valued at US$15.8 billion, of which US$10.8 billion were re-exported, many of them to China.
TDC figures also showed 11,254 Taiwanese projects in China and an accumulated investment of US$5.64 billion at the end of 1995, but this is by no means the end of the story.
Hong Kong accounts for about 60 percent of all investment in China, some of which is bound to originate in Taiwan but end up disguised as foreign joint ventures. Hong Kong invested US$80 billion in China in 1995.

U.S. interest rates have been the focus for most investors in Asia lately, but one key development that has escaped much notice is the increasing divergence of the region's markets, Guinness Flight Asia Ltd said.
"Investors are becoming much more discerning, and market performance across the region is now highly divergent," Guinness Flight said in its second quarter Asian outlook.
"Rather than simply investing in Asia, funds are flowing to those markets where the investment story is strong and avoiding those where it is weak," the fund manager said in the recently released report.
This placed a greater onus on fund managers to get their asset allocations correct.
It was too easy for investors get caught up in the hype about the "Asian growth miracle", but rosy expectations for earnings growth have traditionally been linked to high headline rates for gross domestic product growth and less to what companies have been achieving, it said.
"High levels of bank lending growth and overheating property markets can also produce flattering results in the short term, but the longer-term sustainability of such earnings growth is more questionable."
But long-term growth was available, it said. Asia is a highly dynamic region, but some growing pains are inevitable, reflected in the cyclical slowdown in a number of key export industries or structural problems in Thailand and South Korea.
"Nevertheless, companies that are well-managed and well-positioned have an excellent environment in which to prosper," Guinness Flight said.
To gain access to that growth, investors need to have a clear idea of which markets are the strongest. Stock picking has become increasingly important, it said.
By focusing on companies that constitute the bulk of index capitalisation, investors may miss many of the best opportunities. This partly reflects the undeveloped nature of these markets where blue chips account for the lion's share of turnover, commission and research, the report said.
Concentrating on small and medium-capitalisation stocks is time-consuming and difficult because the information sources are fewer, but Guinness Flight argued it was essential.
"Management quality is the key criterion," it said. "This is very much 'growth investing' as good sustainable earnings growth and strong cashflow are indispensible if a company is to be successful and provide a good return to shareholders. Asia is a growth story and this is where it is happening."
Guinness Flight called China a key prospect. Although tiny as an equity market, China has profound influence and a slow easing of monetary policy there boded well for the earnings outlook of Chinese companies over the next few years.
Guinness Flight is holding an overweight position in Hong Kong and raising Singapore to overweight in expectation of an electronics recovery. It is moving to underweight in Malaysia following greater economic uncertainty there.
Indonesia remains overweight on strong economicdomestic liquidity. The Philippines has been cut to underweight on a deteriorating current account, while South Korea continues to fail to address structural problems.
Thailand has shown no real signs of recovery, although indications are that the market may have reached its bottom, the report said.
The following is Guinness Flight's second quarter percentage weightings against the Morgan Stanley Capital Index Asia ex-Japan. (Figures in brackets show Guinness Flight's weighting versus Morgan Stanley's weighting):
Overweight: Hong Kong (34 vs 26.5), China (1 vs 0.5), Indonesia (7 vs 6.5), all unchanged. Singapore, increased (14 vs 12.5). Neutral: India, increased (7.0 vs 7.0), Philippines, reduced (4 vs 4), South Korea, (5 vs 5), Thailand, (5 vs 5) both unchanged. Underweight: Malaysia, reduced (16 vs 20), Taiwan, increased (7 vs 11.5).

Rising corruption, declining English standards and an erosion in the overall quality of life cloud Hong Kong's future under China, the British Chamber of Commerce in the territory said on Thursday.
A survey of 196 British businesses operating in Hong Kong revealed key uncertainties for British business after the July 1 transition to Chinese sovereignty, despite an overall air of confidence in the future.
Half of those surveyed expected the rule of law to deteriorate, 72 percent forecast a decline in the quality of English and 85 percent were bracing for a rise in corruption.
"The overall message is one of British business confidence in Hong Kong, but that should be tempered by the realisation that business confidence is fragile," British chamber president Patrick Paul told reporters.
"Hong Kong has competitors within the region, such as Singapore and other locations, and I don't think Hong Kong can afford to be complacent," he said.
The survey revealed broad satisfaction with Hong Kong's communications network, its taxation and legal systems and its level of education.
But dissatisfaction surfaced in the costs of doing business, poor Sino-British relations and standards of English.
Looking to the future, most British businesses were optimistic about increased access to China, and they anticipated improvement in Sino-British trade as soon as handover-related hurdles were overcome.
But business costs, availability of skilled labour, English standards, quality of life and maintenance of the rule of law were all highlighted as sources of concern.
Echoing other surveys of ordinary Hong Kong people, a possible rise in corruption was by far the greatest source of worry associated with the return to Chinese sovereignty.
"The concern is whether or not that independent approach to dealing with corruption will be maintained," said chamber of commerce executive director Christopher Hammerbeck.
Paul said concerns about corruption flowing across the Chinese border into Hong Kong were offset by a highly transparent system that would quickly reveal any tampering, as well as an alert international business community.
"The British business community and the international business community will be watching," he said. "If corruption becomes so bad that Hong Kong becomes a bad place for business -- I don't believe it will happen, but if it does -- business will doubtless vote with its feet."
Even with a small rise in corruption, Hong Kong would remain one of the least-corrupt areas in Asia, he said.
Hammerbeck admitted that, as well as pollution, possible post-1997 discrimination against the British played a role in expectations of a deterioration in quality of life.
"It is a concern but that's not to say it will happen," he said.

Taiwan has stepped forward in the delicate run-up to Hong Kong's reversion to China and rejected once more the "one country, two systems" policy guiding the territory's July 1 handover to mainland rule.
In a souvenir edition of the Far Eastern Economic Review, Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui wished Hong Kong well after its return to China but repeated his island's determination never to unify with China under the same terms.
"We hope that Hong Kong will not only preserve its present system of freedom, democracy and openness, but enjoy further development after 1997," Lee said in a paid advertisement.
"However, the (Taiwan) government cannot accept the 'one China, two systems' formula imposed on Hong Kong by Peking (Beijing), because the state of division across the Taiwan Strait differs categorically from Hong Kong's situation."
The statement, a striking reminder of the China-Taiwan issue at a sensitive moment, followed Taiwan's confirmation of annual wargames on June 23-24 in the Taiwan Strait, the scene last year of a tense stand-off between the "two Chinas".
Communist Beijing has considered Taiwan a renegade province since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949 and the defeated Nationalists (Kuomintang) set up a rival government there.
China staged eight months of war games near Taiwan in the run-up to the island's March 1996 presidential election, which Beijing suspected was a bid to pursue full independence.
China fully intends to reclaim Taiwan, by force if necessary, and designed the "one country, two systems" policy with Taiwan -- not just Hong Kong -- in mind.
But Taiwan, which calls itself the Republic of China, has ruled out unification until China's Communist Party gives up its political monopoly and introduces pluralism.
Most political analysts said the ostensibly routine nature of Taiwan's summer military exercises was belied by their timing. Taiwan rejects any link between the wargames and Hong Kong's handover, but few Hong Kong commentators are convinced.
"The timing of the wargames is certainly related to the Taipei government's position on the Hong Kong issue and I think wargames have these political connotations," said Joseph Cheng, professor of political science at City University in Hong Kong.
Michael DeGolyer, professor of political science at Baptist University in Hong Kong, said that the purpose of the exercises was to send a message.
"You have to ask yourself just how subtle is shooting off a bunch of rockets, but it does get across the clear statement that the "one country, two systems" formula by which Hong Kong is being returned to China does not apply to them," he said.
Yet most analysts do not expect any major disruption, citing Taiwan's commitment to a smooth Hong Kong transition and the international community's awareness of issues in the strait.
"Will all this have a significant impact on the handover? No," said Richard Margolis, political analyst at broker Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.
"The scene is set for the handover. It will be full of symbolism but when the first of July rolls around the overall expectation is that it will be business as usual."
DeGolyer said that now was the wrong time for China to force the Taiwan issue. Although Taiwan originally topped China's reunification agenda, Britain's insistence on settling the Hong Kong issue has guaranteed that the next couple of years will be spent ensuring the territory is functioning well, he said.
"If there's any time at which we could consider the Taiwan issue to be the least likely to blow up in our face, this is probably it," DeGolyer said.
But he warned that Chinese President Jiang Zemin had explicitly pledged to resolve the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, just as former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping stated his intention to settle Hong Kong during his tenure.

Hong Kong witnessed another vote in favour of the status quo on Wednesday when future leader Tung Chee-hwa appointed Financial Secretary Donald Tsang to manage the US$19 billion Land Fund after July 1.
The move was interpreted as a vote of support for the outspoken Tsang, whose continued influence as one of Hong Kong's most senior civil servants has long been viewed as an indication of top tier stability as the handover to China approaches.
"That is interesting. That would indicate Donald Tsang is not being marginalised as some people were speculating," said Bob Broadfoot of the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy.
Broadfoot was referring to Tung's decision to appoint Tsang chairman of a Land Fund Committee to be established when Hong Kong becomes a Special Administrative Region of China on July 1.
The Land Fund's management threatened to turn into something of a political football when Tsang's post-handover status was debated earlier this year.
A bitter opponent of Tung's proposals to alter Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, Tsang's continued tenure as Financial Secretary after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control in 48 days was considered less than certain.
Tsang was eventually confirmed, but in February, Tung said he was considering changes in the reporting structure at the territory's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
Instead of reporting to Tsang, Tung suggested that HKMA chief Joseph Yam might report directly to the chief executive, effectively sidelining Tsang.
But no changes have been announced. And Tsang's appointment as controller of the Land Fund was interpreted as a sign that changes were unlikely.
"That puts him back in the reporting arrangement between Tung and Yam, doesn't it?" said Broadfoot.
Tung said on Wednesday that the HKMA will manage the fund under Tsang's direction.
The Land Fund was established in 1984 to assuage Chinese concern about Britain's intentions. The fund, made up of proceeds from government property sales, now exceeds HK$150 billion -- equivalent to Hong Kong's fiscal reserves.
Half of land sales proceeds were remitted directly to the colonial government. The other half was held in escrow in the Land Fund to revert to the post-colonial government.
The fund has become so large that its inclusion into the existing reserves, or Exchange Fund, threaten to boost the Hong Kong dollar and put pressure on the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar peg.
Any change to Hong Kong's independent monetary system could undermine corporate confidence in the territory after the transition, experts said.
The status of the territory's top three civil servants is being watched closely in Hong Kong.
Tsang, Chief Secretary Anson Chan and the future secretary for justice are automatic members of Tung's inner cabinet, or Executive Council.

U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Thursday he expected to discuss with China allegations of illegal funding to the Democratic Party by Beijing during his visit, even though he considered it a domestic issue.
"Obviously I think this will come up in Beijing...(but) this is not a Chinese problem," Gingrich, on a 10-day Asian tour, told the American Chamber of Commerce before leaving for Beijing on Thursday evening.
The Washington Post has reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned six members of the U.S. Congress last year they had been targeted by China to receive illegal campaign funds from foreign corporations.
U.S. Vice President Al Gore said he talked about the issue on Tuesday in Beijing with Chinese Premier Li Peng, who has denied the reports. Gore said that the probe into the allegations should not disrupt China-U.S. ties, but proof of payments would make it a serious matter.
Gingrich, who was in Hong Kong on a two-day visit and was due to arrive in Beijing hours after Gore leaves, said the campaign financing scandal should be treated as a domestic issue, albeit a serious one.
"This is an American problem," Gingrich said. "It is an American law violated by Americans engaging in acts which are illegal in our system, and we have an obligation to police our system."
He said the United States would defend its political system from foreign interference, and called upon Asian nations for cooperation on investigations.
"My only point in Beijing and in Taiwan would be, if we need information about specific people and specific companies, we hope you will give us the information," he said.
The China allegations followed other reports of irregular fund-raising by the Democratic Party involving Asian nations and American-Asians based in the United States.
Gingrich said the media's portrayal of the fund-raising affair as a complicated international issue was incorrect.
"It's not complicated at all," he said. "About a year and a half ago, a group of people sat down and decided they couldn't win the election if they didn't raise every penny they could from every source they could, and if they actually obeyed the law, it'd be too complicated."
U.S. President Bill Clinton this month blamed much of the controversy on a political system that was "out of whack".

Whatever the worries about Hong Kong's return to China this year, business isn't one of them. At least, that's the official line.
"With 100 days to go, it's no big deal from the point of view of business. It's a fait accompli," said Stewart Aldcroft, director at Templeton.
But scratch the surface of Hong Kong's international business community, and niggling doubts emerge.
"Our half (of one country, two systems) is that Hong Kong will retain its present way of life. And I think that remains to be seen," Brigadier Christopher Hammerbeck, executive director at the British Chamber of Commerce, said, rather stiffly.
March 23 will marks the 100-day countdown to the handover to China at midnight on June 30, a date dismissed by most corporate types in party-mad Hong Kong as another opportunity to dress up and play hard.
That's because the actual business of the handover was taken care of years ago.
Ever since Deng Xiaoping flung open China's doors to foreign investment in the late 1970s, Hong Kong has been forging ties with the mainland, actively investing from Guangzhou to Shanghai and building bridges to Beijing with joint ventures, franchises and huge infrastructure projects.
China has reciprocated by listing state enterprises on Hong Kong's stock exchange, investing heavily in the territory's hot property market and establishing a firm Hong Kong foothold for the People's Liberation Army, parts of which have been reinvented as vibrant business machines.
MAINLAND INTERESTS
"There are many, many companies registered in Hong Kong that are primarily owned and backed by mainland interests," said Tai Ming Cheung, analyst at Kim Eng Securities.
Then there are the red chips, companies listed and based in Hong Kong but operating in China, whose 15-year success story bodes so well that their sizzling shares have helped fuel a stunning 22-percent rise in Hong Kong stocks over the past year.
The bellwether property market has risen more than 40 percent in the same period, turning many Hong Kong residents into instant millionaires.
At the same time, the economy is steaming along with growth rates of five percent or more. And while inflation shows signs of re-emerging, it is not yet cause for serious concern.
Relief from pent-up inflationary pressure was only one of the many benefits bestowed upon Hong Kong by an open China, whose land and resources provided welcome expansionary room for the territory's frenzied but constrained economy 15 years ago.
Economists said the economic integration between Hong Kong and Southern China is now virtually complete, with labour mobility the only remaining division in a vast, sprawling metropolis stretching from Hong Kong to Shenzhen and beyond.
"Harsh economics have driven it, the realities of the cheapness of labour north of the border," said Hammerbeck.
THE POLITICS, HOWEVER, ARE DELICATE
Experts warned that while borders are clear, the line between economics and politics is finely-drawn and easily overstepped.
"People are already politically pessimistic. They are already politically sensitive. It is the economic performance that holds them together," said Michael DeGolyer, political analyst at the University of Hong Kong.
While Hong Kong's booming stock and property markets indicate high confidence about the territory's commercial fate under China, big business is quietly but keenly alert to any challenge to the features that made Hong Kong one of the great business wonders of the world.
Rule of law, free markets, free flow of information, tight fiscal control and strong education are an oft-repeated mantra by a business community determined to protect what it views as the essential ingredients in Hong Kong's magic formula.
The "one country, two systems" policy devised by Deng to guide Hong Kong's return to the Motherland guarantees the territory's autonomy, but it has yet to be implemented or tested. Its success is crucial.
"Because we haven't yet reached the post-handover period, we have not yet seen the extent to which (future chief executive) Tung Chee-hwa and thus, also, the future Hong Kong government can exert their independence," said Templeton's Aldcroft.
TUNG ON A TIGHTROPE
Tung's task to uphold a capitalist system inherently at odds with China's communist regime is a balancing act few envy, even though most big business in Hong Kong has banked heavily on his ability to pull it off.
Tung's decision to leave the the territory's team of civil servants virtually intact was greeted warmly, but China's plan to repeal some civil liberties laws was viewed with caution.
"If we get rid of these laws so promptly, what other laws are going to be got rid of because they're inconvenient? That does not give confidence. But at the same time, we must not make too many assumptions," Aldcroft said.
While the handover's success is considered more assured in Hong Kong than overseas, the Hong Kong stock market is over-bought.
Recent consolidation has removed some of the froth, but enough funds are sufficiently overweight to cause disruption should anything "go wrong," said David Semple, regional strategist at Peregrine Asset Management in Hong Kong.
"There is very negative sentiment from the United States," he said. "And if it does go wrong, there will be a very large element of 'I told you so'."

Hong Kong's stock market has been reaching for record highs in anticipation of business as usual -- or maybe even better than usual -- after China takes control on July 1.
But the optimism is not shared by all.
As the handover approaches, the small but influential group surrounding former shipping magnate and future chief executive Tung Chee-hwa is having an anxiety attack about Hong Kong's competitiveness -- and with good reason, according to some.
Some of Tung's advisers even support intervening in Hong Kong's economy.
Everyone's inability to define, precisely, what it is that has made Hong Kong an economic marvel has prompted fears that some magical elixir will dissipate as soon as China takes charge at midnight on June 30.
A free port and strong markets, easy international access and firm defence of the rule of law are acknowledged as key underpinnings to Hong Kong's economic success.
But these features are common in cities around the world.
Most people believe that Hong Kong survives and thrives on a number of less quantifiable elements. Ranking high among these is the "borrowed time, borrowed place" mentality.
With the date July 1, 1997, etched in the backs of their minds, Chinese emigres worked against time in Hong Kong, using ingenuity and determination to transform themselves into some of the world's wealthiest people.
Often in the space of just a few years, the explosive energy of these time-sensitive tycoons spawned huge and diverse conglomerates, notable for their concentration of authority in the iron fist of the founder and his family.
But with China on the doorstep, Hong Kong has discovered that the days of rags-to-riches are not so much over as very, very different.
And that's where Hong Kong is having difficulty.
HONG KONG INC - JUST AN ACCIDENT?
Those who built Hong Kong Inc and know it best quietly fear its success was due more to accident than design, and that replication in the future will prove increasingly hard.
China's decision to slam its door shut following the 1949 Communist revolution forced Hong Kong to diversify away from its obvious strength as a deep-water port and trading entrepot.
Shanghai industrialists fled en masse to Hong Kong, bringing capital, know-how and drive, and a readiness to exploit cheap refugee labour flooding across the border from southern China.
"Hong Kong's natural advantage as an entry port to China disappeared. What emerged was an advantage in industry. Capital was there, management was there, labour was there," said Richard Wong, professor of economics at Hong Kong University.
It was a magic combination that established Hong Kong as a labour-intensive, low value-added manufacturing centre.
China's re-emergence into the world in the late 1970s merely added to the momentum. Hong Kong businessmen moved factories to where labour was cheaper -- into southern China.
It has been an intensive process that, 18 years later, is considered almost complete.
With the July 1 transition to Chinese rule now upon them, the Shanghai dynasties who made Hong Kong what it is today are asking, what next?
HONG KONG HARE RACING ASIAN TORTOISE
"We do not think that the present system can be sustained on its current trajectory," Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professors Suzanne Berger and Richard Lester said in their study, "Made by Hong Kong".
MIT argues that, at some point, Hong Kong is going to have to stop seeking lower costs and start adding value. Labour costs are rising in south China, and factories are moving elsewhere.
MIT believes the incoming generation of "Made by Hong Kong" tycoons will have to shed the "make a quick buck" attitude of the past and invest for the long-term -- and they should do so soon because rising regional competition is starting to expose some obvious flaws in Hong Kong's short-term approach.
Almost like the hare that dashed ahead of the tortoise in the nursery tale, Hong Kong's ad hoc path to success could end up taking longer than the slow but steady course plotted by Asian tortoises like Singapore.
Singapore has already outpaced Hong Kong as the world's most competitive economy according to Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, who cites its better-educated and skilled workforce.
Singapore's labour and housing costs are lower and its English standards higher than in Hong Kong, reflecting the island's early recognition of its role as an Asian service centre in an increasingly competitive region.
"We are only now starting to talk about crafting competitive plans to attract the industries of tomorrow -- years after Singapore," one Hong Kong businessman told MIT.

Hong Kong regulators said on Thursday they are closely watching a dispute between Taiwan and Hong Kong over two Hong Kong-listed call warrants linked to the Taipei index.
"This is something we're keeping an eye on," Bill Weeks, spokesman for Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), told Reuters.
Taiwan is threatening legal action after the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on Wednesday listed the two call warrants linked to the Taiwan weighted index, one issued by Peregrine Derivatives Ltd  and the other by Union Bank of Switzerland.
Weeks said the SFC approved the concept of listing derivative warrants in Hong Kong, but the precise form of the warrants was left up to the Hong Kong exchange.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange on Wednesday said the Taiwan weighted index was its proprietary product and that it had "serious concern and objection" to the new products.
Sources said that rather than a regulatory issue, the current dispute appears to be more a legal matter involving copyright and trademark.
"Because these companies have not been authorised by the Taiwan Stock Exchange to use its index, the exchange has issued an urgent letter to the two firms to express serious concern and objection and reserves the rights for necessary legal actions," the Taiwan exchange said in a statement on Wednesday, shortly after the products were launched.
The Hong Kong stock exchange hit back by pointing out that similar products were listed and traded in Luxembourg.
These call warrants would improve Hong Kong's status as a trading centre for regional products and boost market liquidity, the Hong Kong exchange said.
"The exchange believes that the listing of the products will improve the liquidity of the underlying cash market and is in the best interest of all markets," the Hong Kong statement said.
The Hong Kong exchange is charging ahead with plans to list more regional derivative products. It has not imposed a transaction tax on any regional derivative warrants or convertible bonds.
Hong Kong stock exchange chief executive Alec Tsui said on Wednesday the exchange was publishing a monthly report on the latest developments supporting the listing and trading of convertible bonds or derivative warrants on underlying securities listed on 15 regional exchanges.
They are Tokyo, Osaka, Korea, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Jakarta, Australia, New Zealand, Bombay and the National Stock Exchange of India, Tsui said.

Prudential Corp said on Tuesday its injection of funds into Scottish Amicable's life fund had probably clinched its bid for the mutually-owned life company, Prudential chief executive Sir Peter Davis told Reuters.
"Our offer used the strength of our balance sheet and the Prudential life fund," Davis said. "We've put together an imaginative structure with the key difference being the capital injection or support we've offered of up to 1.3 billion stg to the (ScotAm) life fund."  
Davis said the boost to ScotAm's fund -- the company will be run as a completely separate entity under the Prudential umbrella -- will mean that it will be able to have a more flexible investment policy which could include a greater proportion of investments in equities.
This in turn could raise returns.
The 1.3 billion stg investment comes from Prudential's life fund, which totals 51 billion stg, and will be provided to ScotAm at a commercial rate.
The merger, creating Scottish Amicable Life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in June. The proposals will be subject to a 75 percent vote in favour by eligible members.  
Davis said that on an embedded value or accruals basis, the merger would be earnings enhancing straight away but that on a modified accounting basis, which only takes account of profits on a new policy as bonuses start to be paid, the merger would be slightly dilutive for a couple of years.
The Prudential is paying 850 million stg from its shareholders' funds and its life fund. Coupled with the injection of up to 1.3 billion stg, this will allow the release of around 900 million stg over time from the ScotAm life fund to its policyholders.
Davis said ScotAm will develop more successfully with Prudential's capital backing and is expected to show a larger rate of growth.

Asia-Pacific specialist bank Standard Chartered Plc will boost investment in 1997 and beyond to take advantage of business opportunities, its chief executive Malcolm Williamson said on Wednesday.
"We're giving a signal that we do expect over the next year to increase costs because we're investing more in the business to really get it into good shape for the next millennium," Williamson told Reuters in an interview.
Williamson said he expects Standard Chartered's cost base to rise by seven percent in 1997 after a two percent rise in 1996.  
And Williamson added that the investment was likely to continue after 1997. "It will go on for a period of years," he added.
"We need to step up that investment to give more power to our elbow."
Williamson said that since quitting the businesses which Standard Chartered felt were not favourable in the long-term, the investment will be used to boost its core areas of operation.
He said these are retail banking, which provides around one third of the bank's profits, consumer banking, where credit cards are a burgeoning area and corporate and institutional banking.  
Earlier, Standard Chartered announced a 32 percent rise in pre-tax profits in 1996 to 870 million stg and raised its dividend the same amount to 14.5p per share for the year.
Williamson said the increased investment would not jeopardise the bank's progressive dividend policy.
Williamson said the Standard Chartered strategy does not include major acquisitions but added that in-fill buys could be a possibility.
He said major banking acquisitions in Asia were difficult for practical reasons such as legal constraints on foreign ownership. "So, we're probably stuck with in-fill," he said.  
Williamson said economic prospects in the Asia-Pacific region were fairly bright, adding that both the Hong Kong and Chinese economies were doing well as the handover approaches.
He said that Standard Chartered did not expect the death of Deng Xiaoping or the handover of Hong Kong to China to disrupt the bank's business.
Williamson also pointed out that while some growth rates in Asia were not as strong as they have been, they were still stronger than anything seen in OECD countries.

Britain's takeover watchdog on Friday handed out its strongest sanction to BZW, investment banking arm of Barclays Bank, over its conduct of a bid defence for Northern Electric last year.
The Takeover Panel "criticised" BZW for failing to disclose all the relevant facts, including a performance fee, during hearings over the conduct of the deal last December.
"This is the strongest sanction the panel can take and there is no further action intended," Alistair Defriez, director general of the panel told Reuters. "We have no power to impose a fine."
BZW said it was pleased that the Panel had found it had not deliberately concealed the performance fee and that there was no suggestion that the fee was an inducement for BZW to buy Northern shares which would have been in breach of the Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
The case stemmed from a 782 million pound ($1.2 billion) bid for regional electricity company Northern by CE Electric, a unit of CalEnergy Co Inc of the U.S. which proved to be hotly contested and the result extremely close.
Northern failed in its defence against CE, after the British company lost an appeal to the panel to reverse an extension of the offer period which enabled CE to narrowly win the bid.
The offer extension came after CE raised concerns about the purchase of Northern Electric shares by its advisers British merchant bank Schroders and BZW and a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds to BZW which was a performance fee.
Northern in turn launched its own appeal against the extension of the deadline because at the time of the first cut-off date, CE had fallen short of the total needed to win.
But the panel finally ruled against Northern and BZW was heavily criticised in the press for effectively losing the bid for its client.
On Friday, the panel said it accepted that BZW had not deliberately concealed the fee but that the firm recognised that it should have considered the fee relevant to the panel's deliberations.
The criticism of BZW comes hot on the heels of a 90 million pound derivatives loss at its rival NatWest Markets and is bound to rekindle discussion of the conduct of British investment banks.
BZW has consistently defended its actions, saying that the performance fee was not based on the outcome of the bid and had nothing to do with its relatively unusual plan to aid the defence by purchasing nearly 20 million pounds worth of Northern shares.
But insiders accept that BZW made errors of judgement that undoubtedly led to Northern losing its independence. ($ = 0.627 British Pounds)

Prudential Corp Plc on Tuesday beat off rivals to win control of mutually-owned insurance group Scottish Amicable and reinforced its position as Britain's number one fund manager.
By beating bids from Abbey National Plc and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP), Prudential's takeover of ScotAm will raise its funds to more than 100 billion pounds ($160 billion).
Prudential shares rose as analysts saw the company as deriving strategic and earnings benefits from the deal. At 1315 GMT, Pru was up 17 pence at 557p. "Pru has not gone crazy and paid a stupid price," said Michael Lindsay, analyst at Lehman Brothers. "The acquisition looks to be earnings neutral in the first year and enhancing thereafter."
ScotAm said with-profits policyholders would benefit from cash and additional policy benefits worth more than 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion).
These include 600 million pounds from Prudential shareholders' and policyholders' funds in compensation for loss of membership rights and a special bonus from ScotAm's life fund worth 470 million pounds which will go into policies.
In addition, the entire remaining ScotAm life fund will be distributed, estimated to have a current value of 500 million pounds. On this basis, ScotAm with profits policy holders should receive total benefits of around 1,400 pounds, varying according to the size and age of the policy. Policyholders will also benefit from financial support to the tune of 1.3 billion pounds to boost ScotAm's life fund which will be closed.
ScotAm's original plan was to end its mutual status  and float on the stock exchange in two or three years time. But the plan was thrown into confusion after Abbey National made a bid for the firm last month.
The injection into the life fund had probably clinched its bid for the mutually-owned life company, Prudential chief executive Sir Peter Davis told Reuters. "Our offer used the strength of our balance sheet and the Prudential life fund," Davis said in an interview. "We've put together an imaginative structure with the key difference being the capital injection or support we've offered of up to 1.3 billion pounds to the (ScotAm) life fund."
Davis said the boost to ScotAm's fund -- the company will be run as a completely separate entity under the Prudential umbrella -- will mean that it will be able to have a more flexible investment policy. This could include a greater proportion of investments in equities and higher returns.
The 1.3 billion pound investment comes from Prudential's life fund, which totals 51 billion pounds, and will be provided to ScotAm at a commercial rate.
The merger, creating Scottish Amicable Life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in June. The proposals will be subject to a 75 percent vote in favour by eligible members.
Davis said ScotAm will develop more successfully with Prudential's capital backing and is expected to show a larger rate of growth.
Roy Nicolson, managing director of ScotAm, told Reuters that the Prudential's offer of high up-front payments plus a reversionary bonus added to the capital support had swung the auction in Prudential's favour.
He said the new capital would allow greater investment in equities, providing the opportunity for better returns for policyholders in the future. Prudential's strong investment track record had also been a major factor.
"We're very excited about the business going forward," Nicolson said. "We'll be able to expand our presence dramatically particularly in the IFA (independent financial adviser) market." Nicolson said the deal would remove any doubt about ScotAm's financial strength. He said Prudential had pledged to maintain the number of jobs in the ScotAm head office for three years. Talks were already underway about the possibility of using the expertise in ScotAm's investment management arm in Prudential Portfolio managers. Nicolson said it was far too early to know if there would be job losses outside the head office ($ = 0.627 British Pounds)

British insurance and asset management company Prudential Corp Plc said on Wednesday it is interested in buying a building society but chief executive Peter Davis refused to be drawn on the names in the frame.
"We are interested in buying a building society but for its branch network and its customer base rather than its mortgage book," Davis told Reuters in an interview.
Davis was speaking after Prudential raised first half operating profit, a measure it prefers to pre-tax profit, by 8.0 percent to 421 million stg compared to 390 million last time.  
Davis said he would not comment on any specific names that have been linked to Prudential which have recently included Lloyds Abbey Life, currently controlled by LLoyds TSB Plc.
But industry sources say it is extremely unlikely that the Prudential would be interested in Lloyds Abbey.
Davis was upbeat about the prospects of the Prudential's telephone banking operation which is launched on October 1 and will see its direct sales force selling products like mortgages to its existing customer base.  
Customers will also be introduced to the company's deposit products.
The start-up has cost the Prudential around 33 million stg which was included as a charge in the calculation of operating profit.
Davis said that Prudential's funds under management have risen by four percent since the end of 1995 to 85 billion stg while profit rose to 14 million stg from eight million in the first half of last year.  
Davis hoped there would be no lasting knock-on effect on the fund management industry from recent events at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management but said the affair was sure to make investors look closely at the standing of the institution with which they have their money invested.
"It's likely to be a swings and roundabouts thing," Davis said. "There will probably be a general loss of confidence but we will also see some flight to quality and security."
Davis said the Prudential's insurance business was benefiting from a general upturn in consumer confidence in the UK.  
"Customers are feeling a little more confident and are more willing to make commitments," Davis said.
But he noted that single contribution products were still showing far more growth than those where a longer-term commitment or regular contributions have to be made.
Illustrating this, the Prudential's single contribution sales rose by 50 percent in the first half of the year compared to a gain of 15 percent for regular contribution sales.
Davis said the personal pensions industry had still not completely thrown off the stigma of the pensions mis-selling scandal but he said consumers were starting to realise more that they must make adequate pension provisions.

Banking analysts said on Friday that Lloyds TSB Group Plc's 52 percent headline rise in 1996 pretax profits was rather flattering and expressed some concern for future income growth.
The pretax profit figure of 2.505 billion stg was just above top expectations although these had been expected to be bettered after some components of the group -- Lloyds Abbey Life and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester -- recently reported higher than expected gains.
"There's nothing really wrong with the results," said John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. "But they are not as glorious as they look on the surface."
Analysts pointed out that the large drop in bad debt provisions -- 44 percent down to 327 million stg -- was a surprise, even though improvement was expected given the fact that the bank has increased higher quality assets such as mortgages.
Leonard and Panmure Gordon analyst David Poutney said they would likely not be increasing their profit forcasts for 1997 which stand at 2.825 billion stg and 2.940 billion stg respectively.
But Poutney, who has been advising clients to hold the shares but take profits, said he was now a seller.
"Overall, they are good figures but then it comes down to the valuation of the shares," Poutney said, "and they are looking a bit expensive. I can't see them making much headway from here."
Lloyds TSB shares stood 5-1/2p lower at 496-1/2p at 0900 GMT.
Poutney expressed concern that costs, which were down in the first half, had ended the year virtually flat and also noted that income growth had slowed in the second six months.
All analysts pointed out that the 20 percent rise in the group's total dividend for 1996 to 13.2p per share was more than the market had been expecting with Lloyds continuing to pass value to shareholders via the dividend.
"Bad debts were much lower than expected," said Nick Collier, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, "and there was a bigger return from problem country debt."
Specific provisons for bad and doubtful debts were down to 357 million stg from 459 million in 1995 while profit from its problem country debt portfolio, mainly in Latin America, jumped to 127 million stg from 50 million.
Lloyds said "problem country debt" had improved so much that it is renaming the portfolio "emerging markets debt."
Other concerns in the figures included a sharp rise in general insurance claims to 107 million stg from 70 million in 1995 although analysts were happy that the group has increased its provision against claims from the pensions mis-selling debacle by 39 million stg to 200 million.
Dealing profits were also sharply lower at 96 million stg compared to 175 million in 1985.
Despite their concerns, analysts were generally positive, though, given the shares' outperformance last year, they said this would now be difficult to maintain in 1996. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.

British private client stockbroker and fund manager Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management said on Thursday it is in talks with Dutch banking giant ABN AMRO's ABN AMRO Hoare Govett which may lead to an offer for CCM.
Capel-Cure is controlled by Canadian Insurance Group and chief executive John Henderson confirmed the talks but declined to give any of the financial details of the offer.
Capel-Cure has 4.5 billion pounds under management and employs around 450 staff.
Canadian Insurance, a consortium of banks, bought its stake in Capel-Cure-- the rest is owned by the management -- when Central Capital Corp of Canada went bust in 1992. It had previously been owned by Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Corp.
Henderson said the management of Capel-Cure had been involved at every stage and denied press reports that there had been a disagreement between the Capel-Cure management and Canadian Insurance on whether the fund manager should be sold and how.
ABN AMRO is known to have wanted to expand its London operations with a fund management acquisition.
In January, Jan Vroegop, director of ABN AMRO's global asset management operation said the bank wanted to make "big steps" in the lucrative London fund management arena.
ABN AMRO Hoare Govett was involved in a controversial attempt to poach star fund manager Nicola Horlick from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in January.
Horlick was suspended and later resigned from DMG and ABN admitted that it had talked to her but denied trying to poach her entire team from DMG.
Nick Bannister, head of ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, was unavailable for comment.

London-based international bank HSBC Holdings Plc on Monday posted a 23 percent rise in 1996 profits but chief executive John Bond predicted a challenging year ahead with increasing competition.
Despite the prospect of tougher conditions, Bond said the banking group, which is one of the biggest in the world, had a strong capital position and a balance sheet that made it ready to meet competition head-on.
"We see 1997 as a challenging year wherever we look, whether it be Asia or the UK the competition continues to increase," Bond said in an interview.
Earlier, HSBC announced a 23 percent rise in pretax profits for 1996 to 4.52 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) -- around the middle of market expectations. A hefty nine pence per share rise in annual dividend to 41 pence bettered most forecasts.
Bond said HSBC's British unit Midland Bank would continue to grow organically as the price of acquisitions was impossible to justify to shareholders.
Midland put in a strong performance with pretax profits up more than 20 percent and costs held to a rise of less than one percent.
Bond said HSBC's capital ratios were strong, with tier one capital rising to 9.9 percent from 9.5 percent at the end of 1995. He did not see surplus capital being generated.
"As long as we're making a respectable return on capital, we regard capital strength as an asset in our business," Bond said. "It helps you with the ratings, it helps with deposits in Asia and to have a strong capital position shows in the bottom line."
HSBC had a 21.3 percent return on capital in 1996 compared with 20.7 percent in 1995.
Bond said HSBC continued to be confident about Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese rule in July.
Last year, HSBC was granted a licence to trade in the Chinese yuan and Bond said the bank was talking to the Chinese authorities to see how this would work in practice.
Bond said HSBC was looking at this massive potential business opportunity in the long term.
"I think it will take time, of course it will, but the signs are all positive."
He said the rise of sterling against the dollar had not had a great effect on the group's results in 1996 where the average rate for the pound against the dollar was below that of 1995.
But he said that, very roughly, for every cent the pound goes up against the dollar, the bank loses 13 million pounds in profit. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)

Financial services group Cater Allen said on Friday its purchase of Glasgow-based stockbroker Aitken Campbell from Union Plc would complement its existing activities in share dealing and stock lending.
"We already have a number of allied operations like City Deal and in Cater Allen we have a significant stock lending operation," Cater's managing director David White said in an interview.
White declined to divulge the price of Aitken Campbell but said the amount was not significant and that, while contracts remained to be signed, both sides had sought to reassure both the market and Aitken staff by making an announcement.
"Aitken fits in quite nicely with City Deal and will be a sister company, we're not merging it into anything," White added.
He also noted one of the attractions of Aitken Campbell was that it runs one of only four electronic trading systems in the market -- the others belong to BZW, Kleinwort Benson and Merrill Lynch.
Cater still maintains its discount house and other money market activities and has also moved into fund management.
Union announced on February 25 that it was at an advanced stage in talks to sell Aitken Campbell as part of a major reorganisation, which saw the historic firm give up its role as a money market counterparty to the Bank of England.
Union is thought to have received a bid approach for the rest of the company, mainly an asset play based on its banking licence and desirable headquarters building in the heart of the City, from millionaire Joe Lewis who already owns 24 percent of Union.
Caribbean-based Lewis recently hit the headlines by investing 40 million stg in football club Glasgow Rangers.
Acting executive chairman of Union, Graeme Knox was not available for comment on reports that Lewis's English National Investment Company is offering a 110p cash and shares deal for Union whose shares currently stand at 96p.

Britain's Woolwich Building Society, which will float on the stock exchange this summer, said on Wednesday its pretax profit rose by 18 percent to a record 392 million pounds ($629.5 million) in 1996.
Woolwich chief executive John Stewart said he wanted to see growth in all the company's businesses following its conversion into a listed company.
While its net mortgage lending jumped 50 percent to 1.4 billion pounds, the society said its administrative expenses rose by less than one percent and its cost-to-income ratio edged down to 45.8 percent from 48.9 percent.
Stewart said that if draft building societies legislation were passed in its current form, the Woolwich would have to consider expansion by acquisition very carefully.
This is because in its current form the law would take away a building society's five-year immunity from takeover if it takes over another financial sector company.
"If the bill is passed in its present form, it would make us think twice about acquisitions," Stewart said. "We would have to weigh the strategic importance of the acquisition against the loss of protection."
But Stewart added that, whatever the legislation, the Woolwich would be "out there doing business".
The Woolwich had an excellent record not only in organic growth but also in joint ventures and cold starts. "We have a lot more clubs in our bag, there are a lot more ways to develop the business if we have to think twice about making an acquisition," he said.
The Woolwich, which will be quoted in the FTSE 100 index after flotation and is Britain's third largest building society, sees itself as a low-cost provider.
Stewart said he wanted costs to get even lower. "We think we're efficient, we've got a track record of reducing our cost-to-income ratio and we're not finished, by no means," he said.
The Woolwich wanted to increase its business in areas such as unit trusts, life and general insurance and in the core mortgage business and personal loans.
He said he especially wanted to see growth in its French and Italian companies -- Banque Woolwich and Banca Woolwich -- which he said were already doing well.
Asked if Woolwich would grow organically in Europe, Stewart said, "Oh no, it may well be by acquisition, if the right one comes along."

Toronto stocks closed weaker in heavy trading on Thursday after a last minute sell-off that was led by New York.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index lost 43.79 points to settle at 6205.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 92.75 points to reach 6927.38.
Canada's largest equities market also posted its heaviest trading session and highest value ever, with 169.4 million shares traded worth C$2.97 billion ($2.18 billion).
Despite the drop, the 300 index did not cross the key support mark of 6175 points, said portfolio consultant Ron Meisels. "We're still actually very much above the break-out level," he said.
Toronto's losses were checked by a soaring gold group, which rocketed 3.23 percent on surging bullion price on COMEX. April gold closed $5.00 higher an ounce at $352.70.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices lost ground except for golds and retail. Consumer products led losses, followed by banks, oils and utilities.
Declining stocks edged out advancing ones 518 to 515 while 268 traded flat.
In individual issues, prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. continued to be active, rising 1.20 to 22.70 on 6.7 million shares.
Shareholders were cheered by Bre-X's statement on Wednesday that its huge Busang discovery contains 200 million ounces of gold.
Minorca Resources Inc., which holds a small stake in Bre-X's profits, rose 1.05 to 6.45 in heavy dealings.
United Grain Growers Ltd. shares rose 1.75 to 14.25 in light trading after news that two grain handling rivals, Alberta Wheat Pool and Manitoba Pool Elevators, said they will make a C$13.75 a share offer for all UGG shares.

Toronto's key stock index ended flat after a quiet session on Monday, kept in check by weakness in resource and bank stocks despite a rally on Wall Street.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index edged up 0.30 points to close at 5835.61. Turnover was moderate at 76.14 million shares worth C$1.05 billion (US$750 million).
"New York doesn't have quite the resources weight to pull them south like Toronto does," said Dunnery Best, Midland Walwyn's director of private client investing.
"New York is still being driven ahead by technologies and the wave of good earnings," he said.
Canada's largest stock market was also hurt by concern over a weakening currency, Best said.
The dollar ended softer on Monday at C$1.4000 (US$0.7140) from Friday's close of C$1.3970 (US$0.7158) on fears that the Bank of Canada may have to raise short-term interest rates to defend the currency during the Canadian election campaign.
Foreign investors were worried that political rhetoric over Quebec's separatist movement may heat up over the next few weeks, Best said.
Bank stocks, which have attracted foreign investors in recent months, lost ground on Monday.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, six fell led by financial services, transportation, oils, and pipelines. Gaining groups included conglomerates, real estate and media.
Declining stocks outpaced advancing issues 491 to 446. Another 283 stocks traded flat.
Among hot stocks, gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. was the most active issue, adding 0.40 to 3.65 on nearly 10 million shares.
Investors are debating the future of Bre-X's Busang gold deposit in Indonesia ahead of this week's audit report by Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd.

Canada's largest stock market in Toronto posted its biggest intra-day drop in almost a decade on Thursday as shares in former market darling Bre-X Minerals Ltd. were hammered by investors.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index plummeted 191.21 points to 5931.63, the biggest loss since October 20, 1987, the day after so-called Black Monday when it lost 220.90 points.
Gold prospector Bre-X resumed trading late on Thursday, plunging C$13 to C$2.50 on eight million shares after the company said on Wednesday's its Busang gold find, once touted as the world's largest, may not be as rich as projected.
"It's pretty obvious that Bre-X blew a hole in the market," said John Ing president of Maison Placements Canada of Toronto. "It's...the shock and the ripple effect of the Bre-X disaster."
Investors unloaded their Bre-X shares after trading resumed Thursday afternoon, wiping C$3.12 billion ($2.26 million) from the company's market value. The stock was halted on Wednesday.
On Nasdaq, Bre-X shares plummeted $9-13/32 to $1-31/32 on trading of nearly 6.9 million shares.
Investors seemed unconvinced after Bre-X chief executive David Walsh declared he was confident of the company's reserve estimates for its discovery deep in Indonesia's jungle.
Bre-X's partner Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. said on Wednesday its preliminary studies showed the site turned up "insignificant amounts of gold." Bre-X has estimated the Busang deposit contains 71 million ounces of gold.
During the selloff, the Toronto Stock Exchange's computer systems were halted twice, forcing the market to close half an hour early due to "technical difficulties," an official said.
Worries about other junior mining firms swept the market, sparking a massive retreat in the heavyweight gold sector.
The gold group sank 906.93 points, or 8.66 percent, to close at 9559.92 -- its biggest one-day drop since September 7, 1993 when the sector lost nearly 10 percent of its value.
The carnage also extended to New York's stock market, which lost 140.11 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close two percent lower at 6740.59.
Wall Street, already unsettled by fears that rising interest rates would end its bull run, was further hurt by news that Toronto was suffering its own difficulties with Bre-X, analysts said.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes finished lower, led by golds, banks and base metals.
Trading was heavy with 104.2 million shares changing hands worth C$1.38 billion ($1.0 billion). Declining issues outnumbered advances 787 to 214 with 270 stocks were unchanged.

Sears Canada Inc, Canada's third largest department store chain, said on Monday that retail revenues could grow by 8.6 percent or more in 1997, after an unexpectedly small first-quarter loss.
"We're hoping to do as well or better than that," Chief Executive Paul Walters told reporters after the annual meeting. Sears, which is 55 percent-owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co, earlier reported a first-quarter loss of C$0.03 a share versus a loss of C$0.23 in the same period of 1996.
Wood Gundy retail analyst David Brodie, who had forecast a deeper loss of C$0.10 a share for Sears Canada in the traditionally weak sales quarter, called the results "fantastic."
Sears Canada said first-quarter retail revenues rose by 8.6 percent from a year ago, but it did not break out actual retail revenues. Consolidated revenues jumped to C$875.1 million from C$821.7 million.
Walters credited stronger consumer spending and increased advertising. "Now is the time to step on the gas pedal and grow," he said.
Sears Canada also plans to spend C$300 million over three years to upgrade its 110 outlets, starting in Toronto.
Brodie said he would up his original 1997 profit estimate of C$0.70 by 10 cents or so. "They're in a very good position to step on the accelerator," he said.
"I don't attribute it (the growth) to the demise of Eaton's," Brodie added.
Venerable Canadian retailer T Eaton Co Ltd declared it might close up to 31 of its 85 outlets after entering bankrupcty protection on February 27.
Walters also said Sears Canada had been eying the purchase of a handful of Eaton's outlets. "We've identified stores that are of interest to us," he said, adding that Sears Canada had only considered only a few locations since it already had competing stores in the same areas.
Despite rumors that Canadian retailers may band together and snap up Eaton's outlets, Brodie said it was more likely that a U.S. company would acquire parts of the 127-year-old, family-owned Eaton's chain.
But no matter how many Eaton's stores will be shuttered, Sears Canada will pick up about 20 percent of their sales, or its portion of Canadian market share, Walters noted.
Sears Canada shares rose 0.25 to 14 in Toronto on Monday.

Toronto stocks closed one percent higher on Tuesday, but trailed a stronger rally in New York as fears of a U.S. interest rate hike eased on weak U.S. inflation numbers.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index soared 64.22 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 5743.55. On Monday, the index was down more than 10 percent since setting its lifetime high of 6348 points on March 11.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 135.26 points to close at 6587.16.
Toronto's gains were restrained by its heavyweight gold group, which dropped two percent on weak gold prices.
"We're just following the U.S. side. The U.S. side is very strong on consumer price index numbers," said Montreal-based analyst Bill Ram.
The U.S. Labor Department said on Tuesday the consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in March. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a gain of 0.2 percent.
The weaker numbers inspired investors to put aside fears of another U.S. rate move -- at least for a while, Ram said.
Turnover was moderate with volume of 77.1 million shares worth C$1.35 billion ($966 million).
Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 11 rose led by banks, conglomerates and utilities. On the weak side, gold fell two percent followed by moderate losses in consumer products and real estate.
Advancing stocks outpaced declining issues 513 to 416 with 299 unchanged.
Among hot stocks, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. dropped 0.22 to 2.23 on 5.3 million shares, topping the most-active list.
Bank of Nova Scotia jumped 1.45 to 50.15, while the Toronto Dominion Bank rose 1.40 to 37.00.

Telecommunications firm Mitel Corp sees growth in the computer telephony integration business lagging expectations, Chief Executive John Millard told Reuters on Friday.
"It's certainly come more slowly than we anticipated and we see projections of the volume of business in this area being pushed back, but I can tell you that there's tremendous interest in the networks," Millard said in a phone interview.
Ottawa-based Mitel has stumbled in recent months because its computer telephony integration (CTI) unit, which makes lines and equipment to combine telephone and data into one network, did not achieve forecast results.
Mitel warned investors in late February that it expected fourth-quarter earnings to fall to C$0.10 a share in the period ending March 31 from year earlier C$0.14 a share.
It also took a C$13 million restructuring charge due to increased operating costs and additional price cuts by rivals.
"Before we see what you might call explosive growth in this area, it might be another year," Millard  said of CTI.
He said Mitel planned to release a slew of CTI and PBX products later this year, which would boost fiscal 1998 earnings per share from the estimated C$0.44 in fiscal 1997.
Mitel also makes public branch exchange (PBX) telephone switches and semiconductors.
Shares in Mitel closed up 0.20 to 7.45 in Toronto on Friday and were unchanged at 5-3/8 in New York.

The Canadian unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc bowed to Canadian pressure on Thursday and said it would resume sales of Cuban-made pajamas after consulting with legal advisers and government officials.
On March 4, Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton said the government was investigating whether Wal-Mart Canada Inc broke any laws by removing the pajamas from its 136 stores on February 27.
Wal-Mart Canada is wholly owned by the world's largest retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas.
By refusing to sell the "Puritan" brand of men's cotton pajamas, Wal-Mart Canada could have violated Canada's Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act.
The act penalizes companies in Canada for adhering to foreign legislation such as the U.S. Helms-Burton law that punishes firms for doing business with Communist-ruled Cuba.
Nichole Bourget, spokeswoman for Eggleton, applauded the move. "I think they made the right decision after realizing that ... what was important was that Canadian companies abide by Canadian laws, and I think that Wal-Mart decided to respect that principle," Bourget said.
The maximum penalty for contravening the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act is C$1.5 million (US$1.1 million), Bourget said.
Canada and Europe have protested bitterly against the Helms-Burton legislation, which allows Americans to file lawsuits in U.S. courts against foreigners deemed to have benefited from property confiscated by the Cuban government since the Communist revolution in 1959.
Wal-Mart Canada, which said it pulled the pajamas because of a customer's complaint at a Winnipeg, Manitoba store, said its reversal "reflects our commitment to meet the expectations of the Canadian marketplace."
Last weekend a group of 30 Winnipeg citizens gathered outside a store to protest the move to ban the pajamas by singing "O Canada", waving the Canadian flag and handing out leaflets.
Each Wal-Mart store had carried about 100 pairs of the C$12.96 (US$9.53) pajamas, one of 80,000 items sold by the Canadian chain.

Canadian department store retailers, rocked by the invasion of U.S. giant Wal-Mart, now face the specter of another U.S. buyout after Thursday's bankruptcy protection filing by the venerable Eaton's chain.
Although some analysts bet that Eaton's would shed up to half of its 90-odd stores, others speculated that a U.S. retailer might acquire all or part of the 127-year-old chain owned by one of Canada's richest families, the Eatons.
Toronto-based T. Eaton Co. Ltd., Canada's fifth largest department store chain with annual sales of C$1.67 billion ($1.22 billion), received court permission on Thursday to continue the operations of its retailing unit while negotiating a restructuring plan.
Eaton's arranged financing of C$555 million ($405 million) from General Electric Capital Canada Inc..
Canadian department stores have bled market share in recent years due to a weak economy and the 1994 arrival of Bentonville, Ark.-based discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
Wal-Mart has quickly seized the lead in Canadian retailing market share, with 43 percent. Amid this onslaught, several Canadian retailers have declared bankruptcy.
One analyst, who declined to be identified, said publicly owned Canadian retailers such as Hudson's Bay Co. and Sears Canada Inc. would be especially hard hit if a second major U.S. retailer emerged in Canada.
"If a U.S. guy doesn't come in, it'll be positive for Hudson's and Sears," he said. If not, "that's the worst of all worlds...it makes it much tougher." Sears Canada is 61 percent-owned by Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck and Co..
Another analyst estimated a revamped Eaton's would be worth about C$275 million ($201 million).
The list of rumored suitors includes J.C. Penney Co. Inc., Dayton Hudson Corp., Dillard Department Stores Inc., Federated Department Stores Inc. and Nordstrom Inc..
Duncan Muir, spokesman for Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney, declined to comment specifically on Eaton's, saying: "We from time to time look at Canada, like other countries," he said.
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson spokeswoman Susan Eich said, "We really don't have any plans to expand internationally. We think we have more than enough opportunities in the U.S."
Seattle-based Nordstrom spokeswoman Amy Jones said, "We currently have nothing on our schedule for Canada."
Some Canadian discount retailers were also seen possibly acquiring some of Eaton's unwanted locations, analysts said.
Eaton's President George Eaton, whose great-grandfather Timothy opened Eaton's first store in Toronto in 1869, did not disclose how many stores would be closed or how many of its 15,000 employees would be let go.
Analysts have estimated 25 to 40 stores in some of Canada's smaller towns would be shuttered.
In court documents, Eaton's said it lost an estimated C$151 million ($110 million) in fiscal 1997 ended Jan. 25 on revenues of C$1.67 billion ($1.22 billion).

Toronto's stock market soared to the eighth record close of 1997, rallying on the back of high-flying golds and lots of takeover news in Canada's oil patch.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index lept 60.40 points to end at 6225.78. It also set a new intra-day record of 6225.83 points.
"The market finally has made a major break to all-time high levels," said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels.
Turnover was heavy at 122 million shares worth C$2 billion ($1.48 billion).
New York matched Toronto's gains, jumping 60.81 points to end at 7022.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average passed the key 7000 level on optimism about the U.S. economy, low inflation and stable interest rates.
Canada's largest equities market made a strong move upward after surging bullion prices in London boosted heavyweight gold stocks.
Investors also focused on the continuing merger activity in the Western-based oil and gas sector.
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices spiralled upward except for real estate. Golds, oils, transportation and consumer products led gaining groups.
Advancing issues raced ahead of decliners 607 to 410 while 269 traded unchanged.
Hot stocks included Morrison Petroleums Ltd., which rose 0.40 to 9.90 before being halted in late trading. It had been the target of a C$652 million ($482 million) hostile takeover by Canadian 88 Energy Corp. but on Thursday announced a merger with Northstar Energy Corp.
Northstar rose 0.35 to 14.15 before the halt while Canadian 88 shares slipped 0.15 to 4.95.
A marriage between Newport Petroleum Corp. and Cimarron Petroleum Ltd. was also announced early on Thursday. Newport shares lost 0.65 to 9.15 while Cimarron soared 3.20 to 23.50.
Talisman Energy Inc. rose 1.10 to 46.25 after unveiling a C$1.7 billion ($1.3 billion) takeover bid for Wascana Energy Inc. late Wednesday night. Wascana shares gained 2.05 to hit 19.00 on nine million shares, which was above the offering price of C$18.50 a share.

Toronto stocks closed weaker on Wednesday, hit by the wave of selling after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan questioned whether equity prices could sustain their strong two-year growth spurt.
"It's bearish for stocks," said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index recouped some of its early losses, but still closed down 46.35 points at 6201.43.
Greenspan also expressed concern about the risks of inflation and warned the Fed may need to hike interest rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank about 120 points during the session, but finished the day off 55.03 points at 6983.18.
Greenspan sparked a similar sell off in December after he remarked on the "irrational exuberance" of the stock market, but North American markets later recovered.
"We're going to continue to get this kind of sell off and bargain hunting," Beattie said.
Wednesday's trading was brisk at 104.9 million shares worth C$1.88 billion ($1.37 billion).
All of Toronto's 14 sub-indices tumbled, led by golds, transportation, consumer products and base metals.
Declining issues outnumbered advances 595 to 408 while another 287 stocks traded flat.

China is planning major reforms of its government debt markets in 1997 to make them more responsive to market forces and their rates more flexible, officials and analysts said on Tuesday.
Reforms this year will focus on creating a more market-driven secondary market after a series of measures taken last year to improve the primary market, including the introduction of a public tender for setting coupons, they said.
In a speech on this year's plans for state debt markets, a senior official said reforms in 1997 will aim to improve coordination between the primary and secondary markets, the Shanghai Securities News said on Tuesday.
"We will actively strengthen the role of underwriters as market makers on the secondary market to promote the coordinated development of the primary and secondary markets," Deputy Finance Minister Liu Jibin was quoted as saying. Market makers -- major brokerages or securities houses -- would be required to invest consistently in the state debt market and help to stabilise prices when they fluctuate sharply, industry analysts said.
"A market maker system and off-floor trading will be introduced in 1997," the newspaper on Monday quoted Gao Jian, director of the ministry's state debt department, as saying.
China began state debt issues in the early 1980s with purchases made compulsory for many people such as government employees and staff of state-run enterprises.
By the early 1990s, purchases of government debt were voluntary, but state-run banks were still forced to underwrite whatever amount they were allocated by the authorities.
Real market forces did not come into play until 1995 when Beijing for the first time used a public tender system to set the coupon rate on a debt issue.
The system was used for all issues in 1996 -- an indication the primary market has been largely freed from administrative control, traders said.
"With the changes to the primary market now in place, reforms this year are expected to give more priority to the secondary market," said Lu Weiming, a state debt trader with China Guotai Securities.
"They are looking at reforms to the secondary market now largely because of the increasingly active trading there after three successive years of record debt issues," said a second trader.
China issued a record 195.2 billion ($23.52 billion) yuan worth of state debt last year and industry sources expect this year's issues to hit another record of 250 billion yuan.
In other reforms, the People's Bank of China at a meeting in Beijing last week ordered commercial banks to withdraw from trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets, traders said.
The banks, which have accounted for more than 80 percent of the money supply on the repurchase market alone, have been ordered not to build any new positions and to gradually offset their existing positions.
"The state debt market will gradually move to being dominated by securities brokerages as a result of the withdrawal of the commercial banks," said a trader with J &amp; A Securities.
Other significant changes will include more issues of treasury notes and bonds which pay interest on an annual basis instead of on maturity, officials have said.
The introduction of state debt paying annual interest will allow Beijing to one day open trading on the annual interest rate to pave the way for a possible start of financial derivatives, industry analysts said.
China issued two experimental batches of state debt paying annual interest in 1996.

China named on Thursday four more foreign banks approved to handle local currency business, and bankers said they saw the accelerated timetable reflecting a desire to boost property prices in Shanghai's Pudong zone.
The China Daily said the four new banks were U.K.-based Standard Chartered Bank, Japan's Sanwa Bank and Daiichi Kangyo Bank and the Shanghai-Paris International Bank, a joint venture between France's Banque National de Paris and the Industrial and Commerical Bank of China.
The newspaper said the banks, and four others named earlier, would be able to take deposits and make loans in yuan, the Chinese currency, only after they had moved operations to the Pudong district of Shanghai.
"I see the whole thing as being real-estate driven," said a foreign banker. "To make Pudong a success, they need to get the foreigners over there, so there's no reason limiting the numbers."
The Chinese authorities want to make the Pudong development zone in eastern Shanghai the country's premier financial district, and have told foreign banks they will only be allowed to do local currency business from offices there.
"Before the banks were approved no one would touch Pudong, but now people are charging over there to try and sign something up," said a real estate broker.
Foreign bankers had originally assumed the authorities would wait until the first four banks had begun operations before approving any more.
The first four are Citicorp's Citibank unit, HSBC Corp's Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp unit, the Industrial Bank of Japan and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd
Chinese banking sources said a number of other banks would also be approved for yuan business during 1997.
Foreign bankers said the faster they were allowed into the yuan business the better, regardless of the limitations placed upon them.
Approved banks can only accept Chinese yuan deposits from foreign-funded firms or from foreign individuals, or deposits from Chinese enterprises derived from the banks' loans to them.
The banks can supply yuan loans only to foreign-funded firms or Chinese enterprises who have previously obtained foreign currency loans from the banks.
"We won't be able to increase our customer base, but it's at least a start, another step forward," said a foreign banker.
"It's a very significant step," said a senior banker with one of the chosen banks. "If a bank can't do business in the local currency then it's only half a bank."
"We welcome this good news," said Lance Browne, Standard Chartered's chief executive for China. "It's a positive development for our business in China."
Another banker said specific regulations for the business had not yet been issued by the central bank, and training sessions for foreign bank staff were in progress nearly every weekend.
One banker said he did not expect yuan loans and deposits to begin for another three or four months, to allow all the various issues to be sorted out.

A Chinese court sentenced a U.S. businessman on Monday to 10 years in jail for smuggling garbage, fined him 500,000 yuan ($60,000) and ordered him to be deported, the official Xinhua news agency said.
William Ping Chen had confessed to charges of smuggling banned goods, including 238 tonnes of garbage and a small amount of waste medical items, between July and December 1995, Xinhua said.
The Shanghai Number One People's Intermediate Court sentenced Chen to 10 years in jail and ordered his expulsion from China after finding him guilty of smuggling "foreign garbage" for profit, the news agency said.
Chen still has the right of appeal, but is likely to be deported swiftly if he waives that right.
"We place the highest priority on looking after U.S. citizens in this sort of situation," a U.S. consulate official said, adding that officials had requested permission to visit Chen in jail.
Chen, 56, who was arrested in June last year, was sentenced following an open hearing on December 2 at which he was defended by two lawyers, Xinhua said. The hearing was attended by an official from the U.S. consulate in Shanghai, it said.
Chen had insisted on going ahead with imports of banned waste items despite warnings from officials of the Shanghai municipal environmental protection bureau and the Chinese partners in his Shanghai United Paper Works Co Ltd, it said.
Chen had evaded customs supervision to illegally import the garbage from the United States and "had caused serious damage to the environment of China", the court verdict said.
The court also ordered Chen to pay the 500,000 yuan fine, Xinhua said.
Chen's arrest came during a furore in China over several illegal shipments of U.S. rubbish -- old clothes, rubber gloves, disposable syringes and medical nappies found mostly in shipments listed as waste paper for recycling -- and which escalated into an issue of national pride.
Chinese officials whipped up a nationalistic campaign over the garbage, with Shanghai customs describing itself as the "front line, a steel Great Wall guarding the motherland".
Last year, China turned back more than 200 ships from its ports carrying foreign waste or dangerous materials and issued new regulations to curb imports of foreign garbage.
The rubbish issue touched a nerve in China and also served as a timely tool for Beijing to wave in the face of U.S. attacks on its copyright violations and human rights record.
Chen's sentencing was the first in China of a U.S. citizen since human rights activist Harry Wu was detained in June 1995, convicted of spying and sentenced to 15 years in jail.
Wu was deported to the United States within hours of his sentencing after he decided not to appeal.
Four U.S. citizens are currently serving sentences in jails in China, but officials have declined to give details of the length of their terms or their offences.

China is building a network of major toll highways to supplement its overloaded railway system, and plans to float stock for many of the roads to fund the expansion, companies and analysts said on Monday.
But some brokers questioned the decision to use equity to finance the highway construction programme, saying it would make more sense to raise money by issuing debt.
Chinese officials estimate the country will need around $65 billion for highway construction in the next five years but funding shortfalls are expected to be as large 15 to 25 percent of the total.
China's first international-standard highways only started appeared at the beginning of this decade, but by the end of 1996, the country had 3,258 km of express highway.
There are plans to add a further 900 km in 1997, almost all of it toll road.
Two of the China highways have already listed shares on stock exchanges with more still to come.
The successful Hong Kong listing last November of Anhui Expressway, which runs a 134-km toll highway between Hefei and Nanjing, has encouraged officials to list more highways as a means of raising cash.
Meanwhile, Guangdong Express Highway Development Co, which runs a toll road and a toll bridge in Guangdong province, listed B shares on the Shenzhen stock exchange last August to raise funds for another toll highway.
Four other China highway companies have received approval from the central securities authorities for overseas listings.
Hangyong Express Highway Development Co last year opened a toll highway linking the cities of Hangzhou and Ningbo to the south of Shanghai and hopes to list its shares in Hong Kong.
A Hangyong official, contacted by telephone, said the growing highway network was crucial to China's future.
"Express highways have the advantage of being able to handle greater flows of traffic with a lower rate of accidents than traditional roads," the official said. "They are more convenient and faster than trains, and less expensive for freight."
Foreign brokers in Shanghai said it would almost certainly be cheaper for China to fund its highway expansion through the issue of bonds and sovereign debt rather than equity issues.
"But the local communities want to get these toll roads built and they can't get debt quota," said Brewer Stone, Shanghai representative of Prudential Securities.
He said toll roads posed a risk for investors in spite of the rosy outlook for growth of the Chinese economy.
"I think historically toll roads have often been a dicey proposition because it's extremely difficult to accurately forecast traffic flows," he said. "Drivers can prove to be extremely ingenious in find alternative routes."
But an official with the Guangdong Express Highway Development Co said all construction had to fit in with the master national plan prepared in Beijing to prevent competing projects by different highway developers.

China's securities authorities are trying once again to ban domestic investors from the foreign currency B share market, but brokers said on Friday that the drive had little chance of success.
Chinese brokerages in Shanghai and Shenzhen this week started re-registering investor accounts to weed out domestic investors who are trading B shares, theoritically reserved for foreigners only.
But stock analysts said the painstaking process of driving locals from the B shares seems to have resulted in a compromise with the securities authorities, in fact trying to find an indirect way to legalise those already in the markets.
"The impact on the market will be minimal," said a Shanghai broker. "Many investors are trying one way or another to find a trustee, and we believe most of them will be able to do so."
Brokers said domestic investors with B share accounts had to find a foreigner, or someone with right of residence outside China, to write a certificate to say that he or she entrusts the local person to trade B shares.
"It seems that in Shanghai it is just a matter of walking in with your cousin's passport, but in Shenzhen I understand they are seriously trying to cut back on accounts opened with just an identity card," said Bruce Richardson of HG Asia in Shanghai.
Those who manage to obtain the trading certificate will be able to retain their accounts and can continue to legally trade B shares in their own name. Those that fail will be banned from buying new shares from April 1, brokers said.
"This is nothing more than a compromise," said a broker with a Chinese brokerage in Shanghai. "The overwhelming majority of domestic investors will be able to find a trustee."
The B shares were created in 1992 to attract foreign investment funds into China, but as a result of a market slump that began in 1994, many foreign investors have pulled out.
Their place has been taken by domestic investors, attracted by the large gap in price between B share prices and the much higher prices on the domestic A share market.
Brokers estimate that domestic investors have accounted for at least half of B-share trading in recent months, and concerns that the authorities really mean business about pushing the domestic investors out has been a major negative factor.
In mid-1996, a rush to B share trading by domestic investors pushed Shenzhen's B share index up more than 100 percent and the Shanghai index up 50 percent in just a few weeks.
"The China Securities Regulatory Commission has the tools if they want to really shut down every local B share investor, but I don't think they'll do it, it would be too costly," said HG Asia's Richardson.
"If you took local funds out of the market, or froze them, the market would go back to where it used to be, which I don't think anyone wants," he said.
He said that the CSRC was about the only player that wanted the locals out of the market -- the stock exchanges, brokerages and foreign investors all basically welcomed them because of the extra liquidity they bring to what is still a very small market.

China's foreign currency B share markets are expected to recover in 1997 thanks to the improving national economic outlook, but the fundamentals of most B share firms remain poor, analysts said on Monday.
The B share markets in both Shanghai and Shenzhen have rollercoastered in the past few weeks in often feverish speculative trading, and are about 50 percent up on their low points of a couple of months ago.
Additional solid gains are expected in 1997 once 1996 results are released by the end of April which, if conditions are right, could push the indices to records, analysts said.
But the basic problems with the B share markets -- poor quality companies and low liquidity -- are unlikely to be resolved in 1997, they added.
"The markets are likely to recover next year," said a Shanghai stock analyst with a Chinese brokerage. "I would expect Shanghai's B share index to breach the 105-point historical high. The key factor will be the improved national economy."
Most of the 1996 results, to be posted in April, are unlikely to be much of an improvement over the dismal 1995 results, analysts said. Shanghai B share firms as a whole posted net negative profit growth of 16.3 percent in 1995.
"Any rally in the B shares before the 1996 results come out will not be sustainable," said Edmond Huang, an analyst with ING-Barings in Shanghai. "The recent gains have been driven by liquidity, not by fundamentals."
"But the macro-economic environment is positive and most of these companies have bottomed out, so 1997 should be good for them," Huang added.
Brokers in Shenzhen also said they expected to see the B share market performing strongly in 1997.
"Listed firms will see their operations greatly pick up in 1997 due to the two cuts in interest rates this year," a broker at Shenzhen J&amp;A Securities said.
Year-on-year retail price inflation is expected to be about 6.0 percent in 1996, down from 14.8 percent in 1995 and well below a government target of 10 percent, figures issued by the State Statistical Bureau on Monday said.
The slowdown of inflation rises prompted Beijing to cut bank interest rates in May and August this year, relieving the burden of listed firms. Analysts expect the People's Bank of China to cut interest rates again in the first half of next year.
"Company performance has been improving since the second half of this year," said an analyst. "This will be a major factor to support the markets next year."
All China's B share firms were formerly state enterprises and many suffer from poor management and heavy debt loads which have made it difficult for them to cope with the tight credit policies in force since 1993.
"The long-term development of the B share markets lies in listing more high-quality companies," said one trader. "But this problem is unlikely to be solved in one year."
"With more such companies listed in Shenzhen, the market's liquidity will improve and investor confidence strengthen," a broker in Shenzhen said.
Combined capitalisation of the Shanghai and Shenzhen B share markets is only about 35 billion yuan ($4.2 billion), with 42 B share companies listed in Shanghai and 43 in Shenzhen.
"The markets are too small with investors having little choice of which firms they would like to invest in, and institutions are able to easily manipulate the markets," said a trader. ($=8.3 yuan)

China is setting up a national state debt trading market to link up all state debt trading floors around the nation to check widespread irregularities, industry analysts said on Monday.
The computerised market, the China State Debt Clearing System, would gradually take over the trading of all state debt in the country with the current markets, including the Shanghai stock exchange, taking a minor role, they said.
"Nearly all China's state debt trading is now regional," said a trader with China Guotai Securities. "An institution trading in Shanghai cannot have its positions cleared in Shenzhen, which is inconvenient.
"With the new market being opened, a trader can bid and ask on any market around the country through the computer network," he said.
Major players on China's state debt markets currently include state banks, securities houses, state enterprises and wealthy individuals looking for quick returns or for short-term cash for speculative investment elsewhere.
The bulk of China's state debt is traded through the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges, but there are dozens of other centres through which state debt can be traded.
"The primary purpose of the market is to check rampant irregularities," said one state debt investment analyst. "The most important aim is to eradicate credit trading."
China's securities rules ban the trading of state debt on credit but in practice many trading centres have accepted 20 percent margin requirements for state debt repurchase trading, traders said.
The state debt margin trading has led to huge losses for some state banks and other financial institutions, due to unrecoverable debts, traders say. The official media reported in mid-1996 that the Wuhan Securities Exchange Centre, the Tianjin Securities Exchange Centre and the STAQ system, which trades China's institutional shares, had accumulated debts on the repo market of up to 50 billion yuan ($6.02 billion).
Traders said some banks and brokerages had already started to put their state debt under the auspices of the new market but that formal trading on the system, based in Beijing, was not expected to start until the second half of this year.
"Once the national market begins full operations, financial institutions will be required to have all their state debt entrusted to it," said one trader. "This will effectively end credit trading."
Another reason for setting up the centrally-controlled computerised market was to enforce a recent ban on state banks trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets, analysts said.
The central bank at a recent meeting told state banks to phase out trading on the markets, not to build new positions and to offset existing positison only gradually, to ensure that bank money would not flow into the volatile stock markets.
"All we big four state commercial banks have to get out of the markets," said one banker with the Bank of China. "The new market will enable the central government to enforce the ban."
The big four are the Construction Bank, the Agricultural Bank, the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
Industry sources said the People's Bank of China, the central bank, was preparing to play a major role on the new market to trade short-term treasury bills of one year and below with the state banks in its open market operations.

Foreign airline executives on Tuesday called for Shanghai's new airport to handle a mixture of international and domestic flights and for early consultations with foreign airlines before its 1999 scheduled opening.
Construction work on the new airport in Pudong, which will eventually be the biggest in China, begins this month in the Pudong zone to the east of Shanghai city. It will supplement the existing airport at Hongqiao to the west.
But airline representatives said there was no indication which airport they will be required to operate from after 1999 or what arrangements will be made for them.
Many said they understood the Pudong airport, 30 km (18 miles) from the city centre, would handle international flights and Hongqiao domestic ones.
"But I think that, from an airline perspective, it would not be wise to limit either airport to solely international or domestic traffic," said one airline executive who asked not to be named.
"I know they have plans for new infrastructure but I'm not going to hold my breath for some sort of rapid transit route from Pudong to Hongqiao," he said.
Traffic in Shanghai is very congested, although city officials say the problem will be eased by a network of elevated highways being constructed around and through the city.
Lu Jianhua, an official with the Pudong airport planning office, said the current plan was to have both international and domestic flights operating from both airports, but that final arrangements had not been settled.
"The specifics of flight assignments to the two airports still need to be decided," Lu said.
The first phase of Pudong airport will include a 4,000-metre runway and a 150,000 square metre main building, costing a total of 12 billion yuan ($1.46 billion).
The airport at that point will be able to accommodate 20 million passengers and 750,000 tonnes of air cargo, more than double the present capacity of Hongqiao.
The whole Pudong airport project, to be completed in 15-20 years, calls for four runways and an annual capacity of 70 million passengers and five million tonnes of air cargo.
Lu said a new unified administration would be created to manage both Hongqiao and Pudong airports. They are currently two separate entities and foreign airline executives said they sensed a competitiveness between the two.
Asked which airport he would prefer to operate from, one airline representative said: "We're not going to be given a choice, we will go where they tell us to go.
"But I don't know anything about Pudong. I haven't seen any drawings. We haven't been asked to participate in the design, although we have offered," he added.
Design of the airport terminal has been won by a French consortium, Aeroports de Paris, but the representative said the foreign airlines wanted to have input into the design as early as possible.
"We are concerned because Hongqiao airport is massively inadequate today, despite the fact that it's as good as any large airport in China. We are concerned that, without some input from us, we may end the same way in Pudong," he said.

Shanghai's port will be expanded to improve container handling and the approach channels will be deepened to accommodate large container ships, the port director said on Friday.
The port's container throughput rose 29 percent to 1.97 million units last year and should rise by a further 21 percent to 2.3 million units this year, director Du Deming said.
"The aim is to reach three million units by the end of the century but we could surpass that, we are doing the preparatory work to meet this challenge," Du said in an interview.
Shanghai port, China's largest, has been hampered for more than a century by shallow approach channels and silt build-up from the Yangtze River. Despite continual dredging the approches are only seven metres deep.
"We need to deepen the approaches by five metres, through a combination of engineering and dredging, to bring the depth of the approaches to 12.5 metres," Du said.
"The plan is to achieve this within the next 10 years. It will be a big project with several phases," he added.
Du declined to estimate the amount of investment required to achieve the plan, saying it was under study.
"Water depth is one of our biggest problems. We need to deepen the approaches as soon as possible to allow in the third-, fourth- and even fifth-generation container ships which can hold 5,000 containers and more," Du said.
Fifth-generation container vessels have visited Shanghai, but never fully loaded.
Du said investment in new facilities and reconstruction in Shanghai port would drop somewhat this year below last year's 1.1 billion yuan ($132 million), but that investment would resume growing in 1998. He declined to give details.
He said the port was trying to improve efficiency and had brought average ship turn-around times down to two days last year, a 10 percent improvement over 1995.
"We are inevitably competing for business with other ports in the region, and ship owners and cargo owners can make their own choice," he said. "We need to improve facilities, equipment and particularly information systems."
But Du said he did not see Shanghai port as competing with Hong Kong, which last year handled 13 million standard containers, more than six times the throughput of Shanghai.
"There is not much conflict. China is such a big country that both ports can continue to be prosperous. Hong Kong basically handles the south of the country, and Shanghai the Yangtze basin," he said.
Development of the deep-water port of Ningbo port 200 km (125 miles) south of Shanghai has often been tipped as the answer to the port congestion and silting that dog Shanghai, but Du was cautious on the issue.
"We're looking into it," he said. "Shanghai and Ningbo should both be developed, there is not enough capacity in either to meet the demand."

China's decision to dramatically expand the number of companies listed on its B shares markets will help to finally make them a serious prospect for foreign investors, brokers said on Wednesday.
The securities authorities on Tuesday unveiled a list of 33 companies given approval to offer foreign currency B shares and list them on the two domestic stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Last month, the authorities also named 38 companies for listing on overseas stock markets, most of which are expected to be listed as H shares in Hong Kong.
"They won't be able to list them all by the end of 1997, the volume is just too big," said Hoong Yik Luen of ING-Barings in Shanghai.
"But by mid-1998 if all goes well, the market capitalisation for B and H shares will be doubled or even tripled. Then the China market will become a serious market for international institutional investors," he said.
John Crossman, chief representative of brokers Jardine Fleming in Shanghai, said that while the quality of the companies proposed for listing was not yet clear, the plan to speed up listings was at least a step in the right direction.
"The only way for this market to go forward is for there to be a bunch of new listings, to get the B share markets up to 200-330 listings, and get capitalisation up to $20-30 billion, somewhere where people will pay attention to it," he said.
There are now 86 companies listed on the B share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with total market capitalisation of about US$3 billion.
The new list, approved by the Securities Commission of the State Council (cabinet), includes refrigerator maker Qingdao Hai'er, Benxi Steel, Shenyang Petrochemical and Dalian Refrigerator.
The companies selected are mostly large state-run industrial enterprises from sectors including electric power, transport, electronics, telecommunications, petrochemicals, textiles, light industry and pharmaceuticals.
A local analyst with another foreign brokerage said the list of companies included no surprises and quite a few weak players.
"Bringing more companies to market is positive news but the companies have got to be good quality," he said. "I'm personally not so satisfied with the candidates."
The B shares, denominated in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen, are reserved for foreign investors, but a large proportion are held and traded by local Chinese investors operating through a variety of loopholes.
A spokesman for the Securities Commission was quoted as reaffirming the ban on local investors from holding B shares.
"I think people are saying it because it's the rules and the rules are to be respected," said a foreign brokerage analyst. "But I don't think there will be vigorous enforcement."

Peace could be about to break out in Australia's pay television war as the industry's biggest investors, telecoms carriers Telstra Corp and Optus Communications Pty Ltd, turn to other battles.
Both face upcoming sharemarket floats and new struggles in a soon-to-be deregulated telephone market.  
Any peace deal could see rationalisation amongst the three main players in Australia's pay-TV industry, Foxtel, Optus Vision and Australis Media Ltd, which between them have racked up losses of nearly A$1.5 billion since 1993, when satellite-TV operator Australis was formed.
The rationalisation may include each pay TV operator sharing cable and satellite facilities and an end to exclusive programming, which are expensive, analysts said.  
"I think if they can rationalise the pay TV industry, it is a positive for everyone. No one is going to lose out," one Sydney-based telecommunications analyst said. He added it could swell the market valuations of both Telstra and Optus.
The first signs of peace emerged earlier this month when both Optus and Telstra during the release of their respective profit results for the six months to December 31, 1996 confirmed they were in talks with each other about sharing infrastructure.
"People are in a more conciliatory mood now, than they have been for a long time," the telecommunications analyst said.  
Telstra is currently committed to spending about A$4 billion on rolling out its fibre-optic cable network to four million Australian homes, which carries its Foxtel pay TV service, which it jointly owns with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.
Optus Communications' 46.5 percent owned Optus Vision is spending A$3.0 billion on a rival cable network.
The duplication of networks is a concern to Telstra chief executive Frank Blount, who said this month he was talking to Optus about these issues. "Yes, we are talking about all of our initiativies in the industry," Blount told a news conference. The cost of the two networks is making losses until almost next century, both Telstra and Optus have said.
It is these loss-making areas that potential investors are nervous about. They want them fixed before they take a punt on the Telstra and Optus floats, which are both earmarked for 1997.
"Both are to face the rigours of the stockmarket and both of them have to turn around what are big black holes," said Bob Peters, media strategist at brokers ANZ Securities.
However, any rationalisation of Australia's pay-TV industry will depend on the outcome of the courtroom drama between Optus Vision shareholders and television broadcaster Seven Network Ltd, which has a two percent holding in Optus Vision.  
Seven, which is 15 percent owned by Murdoch's News Corp, has accused fellow Optus Vision shareholders, Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, telecom group U.S. West Inc and Optus Communications, of breaching an agreement.
If Seven wins the court case it could be entitled to buy Optus Vision at a discount.
The outcome of court action, may be settled outside the courtroom as one of the parties has confirmed to Reuters it is in talks with the other about reaching an agreement.  
This agreement could be the catalyst for the pay-TV industry shake-up and see Optus Communications taking over the Optus Vision network and it would then be able to strike a new deal with Telstra about sharing his other's networks, analysts said.
But any agreement between Telstra and Optus over pay-TV needs the approval of anti-monopolies watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which prevented a merger attempt between Foxtel and Australis last year.
The Seven-Optus Vision courtroom brawl has already stalled the planned float of Optus Communications.  
Telstra's float could be held up if it does not clear up its liability to Foxtel, which is paying A$4.5 billion to Australis for a supply of movies over 25 years, analysts said. The Australian government wants Telstra to float by the end of 1997. The settlement in January between arch rivals Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer over the broadcasting of the Murdoch-backed Super League football competition following a meeting of the two on Murdoch's yacht off New Zealand's Bay of Islands at the end of last year, paves the way for more deals, analysts said.
"The changing relations between Packer and Murdoch may have a lot to do with it as well," ANZ's Peters said.  
"It is complicated and it will take a while to resolve, but it is heading in the right direction," Peters said.

Australia's second largest telecom carrier Optus Communications Pty Ltd said on Wednesday it expects a strong result for the June 30 year and still aimed for a sharemarket float in 1997, despite litigation delays.
Optus also formally reported a net profit of A$58.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 1996, up from A$7.1 million a year earlier. The result was first announced last week by its 25 percent shareholder Mayne Nickless Ltd.
"We are expecting a very strong result for the full year," Optus chief executive officer Ziggy Switkowski told reporters.  
Optus reported a profit of A$60.3 million for the 1995/96 year, which compared with a loss of A$17.0 million in 1994/95.
Sales rose 31.2 percent to A$1.19 billion, buoyed by a strong lift in revenue from its mobile business.
Chief operating officer Phil Jacobs told Reuters he expected sales to continue the strong trend in the 1996/97 second half.
"It will be somewhere by a similar amount," Jacobs said.
Switkowski said Optus still planned a sharemarket float in calendar 1997, but a float would have to await the outcome of the litigation between its 46.5 percent owned associate Optus Vision and television station Seven Network Ltd.  
Asked at a media briefing if Optus Communications would put off its float past this year, Switkowski said: "No, not at all the float is clearly held up by the process of the litigation, once the litigation is resolved, the board will meet and make decisions about how the float should proceed going forward."
"The timetable for this year is still very much our desire," Switkowski said.
However, Switkowski said there was a possibility that Optus' planned float may clash with the timing of the sale of one third of government owned Telstra Corp, which would be a far bigger capital raising than Optus.  
"It does appear that the Telstra float will be at the latter part of the year, so when our schedule is clarified and indeed when the Telstra schedule is clarified, we will have a look at what that means to us," Switkowski said.
"It is not impossible that those floats will happen about the same time, we will see later this year," he said.
Switkowski would not comment on the litigation between Optus Vision and Seven or Vision's local telephony services launched mid-1996 to break Telstra A$5 billion market monopoly.
But Optus' Jacobs said Optus Communications had other strategies besides using Optus Vision for the local call market.  
Optus Communications has pumped about A$605 million into Optus Vision, which is currently rolling out its cable network to 2.5 million homes or 40 percent of Australian households.
"It has never been Optus Vision's intention to cable up to 100 percent of Australia's population," Jacobs told reporters.
"It has been our intention as Optus Communications to offer our services to a wide a customer base as possible and we have from the very beginning looked at a multiple strategy to get to those customers," Jacobs said.
If Optus Vision loses its legal battle with Seven, Optus forced to sell its Vision stake at a discount to Seven.  
Jacobs said the full deregulation of Australia's telecom market on July 1, 1997 would put pressure on margins across all of its businesses, but this would be more than offset by growth in the overall telecommunications market.
"There is no doubt that there will be erosion in some areas of our business as competition comes in...but we fully expect that erosion of share would be more than offset by the continued growth of the business," Jacobs said.
Optus is also owned 24.5 percent each by Cable and Wireless Plc of Britain and U.S. telephone carrier BellSouth Corp Inc. The remainder is owned by Australian institutions.

Members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum must accelerate liberalisation in the fast-growing telecommunications sector, an Australia official told an APEC meeting on Wednesday.
Telecommunications Minister Richard Alston said the world's US$2.0 trillion telecommunications and information technology market presented huge investment opportunities.
"APEC leaders and ministers have...consistently confirmed a clear agenda for APEC to liberalise the telecommunications environment," Alston said told the meeting of APEC telecommunications ministers.
"This meeting aims to accelerate this agenda by identifying areas where further work is needed and by endorsing new forward looking intiatives," he added.
Total global telecommunications investment for 1996 is estimated to be about US$161 billion, said John Legere, president and chief executive officer of AT&amp;T Asia Pacific.
Australia's telecommunications industry, meanwhile, was growing faster than the nation's economy -- a similar story to other APEC nations, Alston said.
The U.S. telephone giant, which has a presence in every market in the Asia Pacific, is keen to expand in the region through further investment, Legere told Reuters in an interview.
"Asia-Pacific is by far the fastest growing area in the world. The telecommunications services per density is the lowest in the world. AT&amp;T sees Asia-Pacific as one of the key markets it needs to tap into for future growth," Legere said.
Legere said the industry investment opportunities would be diverse, from mobile communications to fixed telephone lines, as well as the Internet, on-line and entertainment services.
Australia's Alston gave a local example on the investment opportunities that have been created since the country started deregulating its telecommunications market in 1992 and which is to be fully deregulated by July 1, 1997.
Australia's two largest telecommunications carriers state-owned Telstra Corp and Optus Communications are investing A$7.5 billion on laying their respective fibre optic cable networks to carry telephony, on-line and interactive services.
"We shall continue to pursue and encourage private sector investment and provide for a liberalised telecommunications environment," he said.
Indonesia is also in the process of opening up its telecommunications market and had attracted a large flow of funds as a consequence, said Jonathon Parapak, secretary general of Indonesia's telecommunications department.
Parapak told Reuters that Indonesia, which has a low fixed telephone penetration rate, planned to invest over US$10 billion, with most of the funds coming offshore, in the five years leading to 1999.
"We needed this foreign investment as we knew we could not do it by ourseleves," Parapak said.
Indonesia had at the end of 1995 1.7 telephone lines per 100, but the country plans to have five telephone lines per 100 people by the year 2000, Parapak said.
The APEC ministers hope to agree on a policy framework for the telecommunications and information industry by Friday, the final day of the APEC meeting.

Australian television broadcaster Seven Network Ltd on Wednesday reported a 31.5 percent fall in net profit for the half year to December 31 as the network started to account for tax.
A slightly better performance in the second half of the 1996/97 year is expected, compared with the same period a year earlier, giving a stronger full year result, Seven's managing director Gary Rice told Reuters in an interview.
Seven, about 15 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, reported a fall in net profit to A$63 million (US$47.55 million) in the half, from A$91.88 million a year earlier, after paying A$34.3 million in tax.
Seven, 20 percent owned by its chairman Kerry Stokes, also unveiled earnings for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for the first time since it jointly took control of the Hollywood studio with United States billionaire Kirk Kerkorian late last year.
MGM reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of US$16.7 million in the period from October 10 last year to December 31 on an operating revenue of $228.7 million, Seven said in a statement.
"We are very happy with the progress at MGM," Rice said.
However, the MGM figures were not included in Seven's group result.
The second half of the year to June 30, 1997, should show some operational improvements, Rice said. "I think in relative terms, I would expect to see a slight improvement in general performance terms in the second half."
Asked if he saw a better performance for the whole year, Rice replied: "Yes." The network also declared a half year dividend of 4.5 cents, steady with the same period in 1995/96.
Analysts forecast Seven to report a net profit before abnormals of A$59 million to A$65 million for the first half.
Seven has nearly exhausted its tax credits following losses racked up by previous owner, fugitive Australian businessman Christopher Skase, whose business empire collapsed after a failed US$1.5 billion takeover bid for MGM in 1989.
Although it did not expect to pay tax for another two years, accounting standards required recognition of the income tax expense, Seven said.
Seven reported a 3.2 percent rise in operating profit to A$96 million for the 26 weeks to December 28, a company record and also within market expectations. Seven said the result was achieved despite a softening in the advertising market.
Sales for the television network rose 16 percent to A$418.3 million for the half, boosted by advertising revenue from its coverage of the Atlanta Olympics last year and the acquisition of regional TV group Sunshine Broadcasting in December 1995.
The coverage of the Atlanta Olympics produced a small gross profit and it recorded an abnormal gain of A$3.2 million on the sale of Sunshine Broadcasting's radio asset, Seven said.
Rice said he was optimistic about meeting targets.
"I think we will meet our financial targets and I think our performance will be quite strong in every respect," he said.
"We have had a reasonable January, February is not bad. We achieved budget in January and we will go close to achieving budget in February. So it's not bad, but it hasn't really kicked at this stage."
Seven shares were carried to a strong finish as the overall market hit a record close. The company's shares closed five cents stronger to A$4.18 after spending most of the day's below Tuesday's close.

APEC ministers agreed on Friday on further trade and investment liberalisation in the telecommunications sector, but recognised they cannot drag China into the forum's agenda of trade liberalisation.
"There has been an agreement by all economies to adopt the strategy of going towards open trade and liberalisation in the trade in telecommunications," Australian telecommunications minister Richard Alston told reporters.  
The Australian minister said China was connecting 15 million telephone lines a year, but still had one of the lowest penetration rates of fixed telephone lines amongst members of the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum.
"The challenges and the enormity of scale of operations of that country can hardly be compared to countries such as PNG (Papua New Guinea) and Brunei ... and so that is why you would have to allow for different views," he said at the end of the three-day meeting.  
Alston said he was also hopeful that Malaysia, which was the only member of the APEC group not to come to the meeting, to attend future meetings.
Malaysia did not attend the initial APEC telecommunications ministers meeting in Seoul in 1995.
"We would all hope Malaysia will over time see the benefits that derive from collective discussions," Alston said.
"I think the high level of interest amongst the 17 economies, that will benefit Malaysia, even in absence."  
Alston, who hosted the second APEC ministerial meeting on telecommunications and the information industry, said APEC could not push member countries to conform to a uniform policy.
"It is not a regional government. It is not intended to drag unwilling players along a path that the majority thinks desirable," said Alston in reply to a question about reports that China was reluctant to adopt telecom liberalisation.
"Whilst there might be some domestic reservations about particular aspects, the overall guiding principles are well recognised. You simply don't find a member economy that does not espouse the principles of the reforms in this area," he said.  
Although there were no tangible projects to come out of the meeting, ministers agreed on further collaboration on working groups to look at telecommunications for rural development, distance education, information sharing and the environment.
"It would be very short sighted if we simply committed ourselves to physical rollout without taking into account the effect to the natural environment," Alston said.
Alston said rapid technological change in informational technology and telecommunications had thrown up new challenges, such as dealing with the acceptance of electronic commerce and taxation issues that go along with it.  
"Undoubtably there will a reluctance to fully embrace electronic commerce and all of its manifestations, until we do solve problems of privacy," Alston said.
Alston said he expected electronic commerce to be a growing industry once encryption and security issues had been resolved, but taxation issues will start become more important.
"It hasn't yet reached the stage of being an avalanche of siphoning off the revenue from the taxation authorities, but it clearly has some potential in that regard and I think all member economies are aware of the need to handle the issue," he said.  
The next meeting of telecom ministers is in Singapore in mid-1998. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

The Australian government appointed stockbrokers on Thursday to manage the proposed sharemarket float of its telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp, which will be the nation's largest privatisation.
The float is estimated to raise a minimum of A$8.0 billion (US$6.32 billion) -- and perhaps much more.
Finance Minister John Fahey said he wanted the Telstra float, through the sale of a third of the government's 100-percent stake, to go through by the end of the year.
"I want it ready to go to the market this year, this calendar year," Fahey told reporters.
"But I am not saying it will," he said. He added it was unclear whether the float of other international telephone companies would affect the float timing. France Telecom and Italy's state-owned Stet are also planned for sale this year.
Australian brokers J.B Were &amp; Son, U.S.-based CS First Boston and European based ABN AMRO/Rothschild had been appointed global co-ordinators for the float, Fahey said.
He said J.B Were, Ord Minnett of Australia,  CS First Boston, U.S.-Australian consortium Goldman Sachs/Macquarie Bank, Daiwa of Japan, ABN AMRO/Rothschild and German owned Deutsche Morgan Grenfell were appointed joint lead managers.
The float would not be underwritten in Australia, where 65 percent of the offer is to be sold. But the shares offered in the United States would be underwritten and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the minister said.
Two percent of the offer is set aside for Telstra employees and foreign investors are entitled to 35 percent.
Fahey would not comment on how much the government expects to raise from the partial sale of Telstra. "I want to get optimum value for taxpayers of Australia," Fahey said.
Australia's Liberal-National Party coalition government was elected just over a year ago promsing to sell one-third of Telstra, with A$1.0 billion of the sale proceeds going to set up an environment fund.
The float of Telstra will far exceed other privatisations by the Australian government in recent years. The sale of Commonwealth Bank of Australia raised a total of A$8.0 billion, in two separate tranches, and the 1995 float of Qantas Airways Ltd raised A$1.45 billion.
The announcement was a boon to Australia's stockbroking community whose Christmas bonuses will be swelled by the Telstra float. The bidding for the Telstra deal was contested by 30 broking firms, which were invited to lodge proposals.
However any of the appointed brokers for the managment of the Telstra float would be barred from managing the proposed float of rival telecom group Optus Communications Pty Ltd as it would be a conflict of interest, Fahey said.
"They will not be able to take part in other transactions which the Commonwealth (government) considers to be a conflict of interest and that includes taking part in a public offer of some other telecommunications group," Fahey said.
Optus plans a share market float later this year, but the float is held up by court action.

St George Bank Ltd managing director Jim Sweeney said on Thursday the bank is aiming to achieve higher costs savings from the Advance Bank Australia Ltd merger than the A$140 million currently targetted.
"We are on the public record as saying that we want to take A$140 million out. Our private aim is to do better than that," Sweeney told Reuters in a telephone interview.
"I am not going to go to the market with any disappointing news on the cost front over the next 12 to 18 months," Sweeney said.  
The St George-Advance merger cleared its final hurdle on Tuesday, when the Supreme Court of New South Wales approved Advance's capital reduction programme as part of the scheme of arrangement between the two Sydney-based banks.
Sweeney said the merged bank, which will trade as St George, will have a bigger balance sheet which will enable it to introduce new products which could, in turn, increase revenue.
"We are paying a huge amount of attention to costs, but we are also paying a huge amount of attention on the revenue side and there are a number of things that we will announce in the next couple of weeks that will also give that a major boost."  
"There is something in the pipeline that we are quite excited about, which we think is a revenue advantage compared with others," said Sweeney, but would not add further details.
Sweeney said the merged bank, which would double the size of St George to a bank with A$40 billion in assets, would look at outsourcing some of its activities in order to reduce costs.
"We are really looking at everything that gets done in the bank...and we want to strip the place down and start again."
"We are questioning everything...for instance do you need to manage your own mortgages? could these things be outsourced? do you you need to own your own mainframe?," Sweeney said.  
Sweeney said the country's mortgage market was patchy. The main lending product of St George, which changed from a building society to a bank in 1992, is mortgages.
"It is very patchy. I have been disappointed that the new cottage (home) starts haven't been stronger than what they are."
"St George on its own has been writing some very handsome figures over the last few months, but it seems to be that other organisations are experiencing similar situations and some are not going too well at all," Sweeney said.
Australia's latest housing data showed housing finance fell 2.9 percent in November.  
St George would have a market capitalisation of over A$4.00 billion after the merger, based on current prices making it one of the countries top 25 listed companies.
But, Sweeney said the merger did not mean that the bank was takeover-proof. National Australia Bank Ltd has a 6.8 percent stake in St George and has been seen by some investors as a predator for St George.
"I don't think in the long run that any publicly-listed company is takeover proof," Sweeney said. Results of the Wallis Inquiry into Australia's financial system, which are due in March, may loosen current bank ownership rules.  
The Advance takeover was St George's fifth takeover attempt of a fellow regional bank over the past two years, but Advance was also the largest bank St George tried to take over.
"Whilst we have certainly had some disappointments through a range of different reasons, if you were ever going to suceed (in a takeover) this was the one to succeed with because it's the one with one fell swoop makes an enormous amount of difference." St George's offer values Advance at over A$2.6 billion. The merger is expected to be formally complete on January 29, but it is expected to take around two years to integrate the two banks.

Australian corporate profits, largely in line with expectations in the latest earnings season just finished, are on the mend after 18 months of disappointment, analysts said.
Overall earnings still fell but analysts are optimistic that profits for the year to June 30 should show an overall rise as economic growth gathers pace and commodity prices trend higher. The results also reflected cost cutting, as companies tear into costs to deliver earnings growth in Australia's low inflation environment, analysts said.  
Craig Drummond, head of research at brokers J.B. Were &amp; Son, said earnings per share (EPS) for industrial companies was 1.7 percent up while resource company EPS was down four to five percent.
The drop in resource earnings, due mainly to lower commodity prices and a higher Australian dollar, pulled overall earnings slightly down, Drummond said.
He said this corporate earnings season marked the end of disappointing profits that industrial groups have posted over the past 18 months. He said both industrial and resource profits should rise in the second half of 1996/97 and calendar 1998.  
"The market is not really worried about this half year result and we should start with banks having reasonable results in May," Drummond said.
Three of Australia's four largest banks, National Australia Bank Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, are to report their 1996/97 first half results in May.
David Rees, equity strategist at brokers BT Securities: "I think compared with 12 months ago there have been a lot of signs of improvement. I think compared with what people were expecting, ... it is pretty close to line ball."  
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, pastoral and energy group Wesfarmers Ltd and retailers Woolworths Ltd and Coles Myer Ltd all reported better-than-expected profits.
"I think what is important for the market is what happens next and our view is that given the evidence of cost cutting and restructuring, given what has happened, we are looking for improvements across a whole range of companies," Rees said.
Rees said there should also be earnings improvements coming from the growth in Australia's capital expenditure (capex), which the government expects to be about 17 percent for 1996/97.  
"What we are now looking for is the follow through from capex ... to the bottom line," Rees said. Analysts said many companies improved their 1996/97 half profits by cost cutting.
Marcus Tuck, economist at HSBC James Capel, said: "Generally the cost cutting has been good and you could say that managers are slowly learning to deal with a low inflation environment."
Australia, which has enjoyed 22 quarters of continuous economic growth, has only seen three quarters with inflation rates above five percent and has had 12 quarters since June 1991 with an inflation rate below two percent.  
With the results season out of the way, investors are currently more concerned about the outlook for U.S. interest rates, said Mark O'Brien, head of equities at Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP).
"The results that have been coming out having been largely in line. Very quickly once they (investors) realised the results weren't going to be disappointing, they turned their attention to U.S. interest rates," O'Brien said.

Australian Internet service provider OzEmail Ltd on Thursday launched long-distance telephone calls over the Internet at a quarter the cost charged by existing Australian phone companies Telstra Corp and Optus.
OzEmail, which is based in Sydney but listed on the technology-heavy NASDAQ market in the United States, said users do not need a personal computer for the new service. A call can be made from any telephone by dialling a number which then connects the call to the Internet and the destination.
The new service, called a world first by OzEmail, was launched with former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating making the first call to Mark Roberts, telecommunications analyst at Montgomery Securities in the United States.
"Today, I am pleased to launch what I am confident will become one of the major means by which we will communicate with the rest of the world," Keating told reporters at the launch.
Keating described the call's quality as being equal to or better than a call on a cellular phone. Under OzEmail's new service, calls to the U.S. and Britain would cost A$21 (US$27) per hour compared with about A$77 charged by Telstra and Optus.
"Calls over the Internet are less expensive because of the superior bandwidth utilisation of the Internet as compared to the traditional technology employed by telephone companies," OzEmail chief executive Sean Howard told reporters.
The service would initially be exclusive to OzEmail's 100,000-plus Internet customers, who would only be able to place long-distance calls within Australia and to New Zealand, the United States and Britain in the early stages, Howard said.
After two months the service would be made available to the public with the residential market targeted first, Howard said. The reach of its calls will then be expanded to Japan, Hong Kong and Italy, with Taiwan and another Asian country a possibility.
Calls can only be made from Australia or by Australians travelling overseas, as regulations prevented OzEmail from providing the service to citizens of other countries.
Keating said: "It opens up a new market, particularly for low-income families that were previously excluded from the long-distance market because of the high cost."
Under Keating's term as prime minister, which ended in March 1996, Australia started deregulating its telecommunications industry, which will become fully deregulated on July 1, 1997.
The current coalition government of Prime Minister John Howard is also planning to sell a third of state-owned Telstra, which could raise an estimated A$8.0 billion (US$6.2 billion).
Any valuation on Telstra could be affected by the impact of cheaper telephone calls over the Internet, Keating said.
"This might even lower the valuation of Telstra, but I don't have to worry about that anymore," a smiling Keating said.
Australian telecommunications analysts agreed that cheaper telephone service via the Internet would be a threat to both Telstra and Optus, which also plans a share-market float.
"Local telephony over the Internet has been a threat to the carrier market for some time and that is why Telstra and Optus are trying to get involved in the Internet and carry more Internet traffic," one Sydney-based telecoms analyst said.
"I don't think they (Telstra and Optus) will be encouraging local calls over the Internet," the analyst said.

The Asia-Pacific region should work towards lowering telephone charges to stimulate usage and promote economic growth, Australian Telecommunications Minister Richard Alston said on Thursday.
"An important emphasis of our work must be to ensure that users benefit from progress being made in telecommunications," Alston told the second Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) telecommunications ministers meeting.  
"At the most basic level this means providing access to people who have lacked it, by extending the reach of networks and by lowering prices to ensure that genuine access is available to all our people," Alston said.
"Our experience is that real cost reductions are possible, but they are less likely to be achieved under monopoly arrangements," he said.
Alston cited Australia's example. In June, privately owned telecommunications and pay television group Optus Vision started to offer local telephone calls at 20 cents per call, which was 25 percent cheaper than that charged by state-owned Telstra.  
Australia's six-month-old conservative government plans to sell one-third of Telstra in the 1997/98 financial year to June.
The three-day APEC ministers meeting aims to co-ordinate a regional telecommunications policy, also known as Asia-Pacific Information Infrastructure (APII).
"The development of the APII will encourage business activity and growth in the region. It will increase the investment funds available for the provision, expansion and modernisation of telecommunications networks," Alston said.  
Alston, who is hosting the APEC meeting, said lower prices for telecommunications services, telephones, on-line and interactive services would stimulate economic activity.
"It remains a paramount objective of APEC to ensure that these trade and investment flows are able to occur by removing barriers through liberalising reforms," he said.
A more sophisticated telecommunications infrastruture in the Asia-Pacific region would result in the provision of more services and employment opportunities, Alston said.  
"Consumers and businessess, both large and small, will benefit from increased activity in information services with lower prices and the availability of a greater range of services," Alston said.
APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

British utility Northern Electric Plc made a last-ditch attempt Monday to remain independent by trying to overturn the extension of an offer by CE Electric that gives the U.S. company a majority of its shares.
Britain's takeover panel was meeting Monday to consider an application by Northern and its advisers BZW to appeal the board's unusual decision to extend the bid. The panel extended the deadline on the 782 million British pound ($1.3 billion) bid from Dec. 20 until Dec. 24.
The panel extended the fiercely fought bid on Friday in what newspaper reports said was a reaction to BZW's initial failure to disclose an extra 250,000 pound ($417,000) fee related to its performance in the bid.
"Following the investigation, the executive will consider what, if any, further action is appropriate," the panel said in a brief statement.
BZW has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman said, "We have absolutely nothing to hide from an investigation and we expect to be fully exonerated."
But asked whether the investigation may last into the New Year, the spokesman added: "I would think so, yes."
The panel noted it may also look into the acquisition by BZW and investment bank Schroders of 2.32 percent of Northern Electric's shares last week.
As the initial deadline expired, CE had obtained control of only 49.77 percent of Northern. But after the deadline was extended until Christmas Eve, CE notched that total up to 50.13 percent, a majority that would have given it victory.
But acceptances after the initial deadline require consent from the Takeover Panel. Northern is now fighting to appeal the extension to try to make the late acceptances null and void and to retain its independence.
"If the panel rejects the right to appeal, or the appeal fails, then Northern will be taken over. If the appeal committee says the panel was wrong to extend the bid, then Northern stays independent," said one analyst who declined to be identified.
At Newcastle-based Northern's request, dealing in its shares was temporarily suspended from Monday morning, standing at 638 pence ($10.68), pending the conclusion of the appeal process.
CE, which is 70 percent owned by Omaha-based CalEnergy, then complained to the panel last week about share purchases made by BZW and Schroders. The panel said there was nothing wrong with those share purchases but did rule out further buying by BZW and Schroders when it extended the deadline.
A BZW official told Reuters that the fee from Northern was not in any way linked to BZW buying of Northern shares.
Northern had fought hard to fend off CE Electric's 650 pence ($10.88) per share bid, which it claimed undervalued the company, promising a 17 percent rise in its final dividend and lower than expected debt.
CE Electric, which raised its original 630 pence ($10.55) offer on Dec. 6, maintained that it was offering a fair price and has already bought nearly 30 percent of Northern on the market. It has said it will hang on to that stake even if its bid fails, which analysts said could depress Northern's shares.
The bid is the second hostile takeover that Northern has faced -- it spent 560 million pounds ($933 million) fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner, last year.

Tesco became the latest British supermarket to put banking on its shopping list on Thursday with plans for a venture with Royal Bank of Scotland, shifting the focus further from price, analysts said.
"With more supermarkets investing in financial services, there is less likelihood of a price war," said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Tesco said it will set up a joint venture in financial services with Royal Bank which will take over Tesco's interest-paying ClubCard Plus account and launch a credit card as a first move over the summer.
The two companies, which will be equal partners in the venture, said the link-up would stretch over Direct Line telephone banking and Scottish Widows fund and life assurance group, which already has a strategic alliance with Royal Bank.
Tesco expects the two companies to invest around 40 million pounds ($65 million) during the first year in the venture, which does not need a banking licence.
The new venture could make a loss of between five and 10 million pounds in the first year, marketing director Tim Mason told Reuters, but should move to profits in the second or third.
Mason said Tesco hoped to see similar profits eventually to those gained by retailer Marks &amp; Spencer from its financial services, which have been running for some 15 years and brought in around 61 million pounds last year.
"If we didn't feel we could do that sort of level medium term, then we would not be as interested as we are," Mason said.
"Tesco views it as its chance to make Marks &amp; Spencer style financial services profits...the worry I have is that everybody is dashing in to this and as competition increases, prices could fall," said Dave Stoddart of Henderson Crosthwaite.
Tesco, which tipped rival J. Sainsbury off the market leader perch in late 1995, helped by the launch of its ClubCard loyalty scheme, is the third of the big four supermarkets to commit to financial services.
Tesco's partner in ClubCard Plus, National Westminster Bank, declined a further link-up because it did not need Tesco's distribution given its strong presence in Britain and wanted to keep a clear separate identity, a spokesman said.
Tesco's chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin resigned his place on NatWest's board on Thursday after over 15 years of tenure.
Sainsbury, which was forced to launch its own loyalty card last year after the success of ClubCard, surprised the market by becoming the first of the big four supermarkets to plunge into banking when it announced plans for Sainsbury's Bank last year.
Sainsbury holds 55 percent in the bank while partner Bank of Scotland has 45 percent.
Safeway, the third largest grocery group, teamed up with high street bank Abbey National in November to launch banking services through its ABC loyalty card.
But the intensifying battle on services and loyalty has triggered profits warnings at both Sainsbury and Safeway in the last month, as loyalty offers to attract more customers hurt margins while inflation and sales growth remain slow.
Shares in Tesco, whose 7.5 percent sales growth over the key Christmas period was ahead of both Sainsbury and Safeway, gained two pence to 340 pence by 1154 GMT while Sainsbury nosed up half a penny to 314-1/2 pence and Safeway rose 3-1/2 pence to 360.
ASDA, which prides itself on being the cheapest of the big four and has no nationwide loyalty card nor financial services link, saw shares slip a penny to 114 pence.
ASDA's strong sales growth has kept management reassured the company does not need to plunge into financial services while it focuses on price, but analysts said the shift in focus by its rivals could add pressure for ASDA to join in.
"It certainly seems to throw the ball into ASDA's court. They pride themselves on a simple price message but I think they will have to offer similar service extras at some time," the analyst said. ($1=.6128 Pound)

Northern Electric Plc on Tuesday lost its bitterly-fought battle to stay independent when it finally fell victim to a 782 million pound ($1.31 billion) hostile bid from U.S. utility CalEnergy Co Inc.
CalEnergy's CE Electric won control of the privatised British regional electricity company (REC) with a wafer-thin majority, gaining the support of only 50.3 percent of the votes. The margin was a mere 300,000 shares.
The bid was so closely fought it ran over its original deadline and the outcome was in doubt right down to the wire.
Insurer Prudential Corp stepped in at the eleventh hour to try and thwart CE's efforts, by buying up nearly one million Northern shares from investors who had previously accepted CE's bid.
CE Electric's chairman and chief executive David Sokol said, "We look forward to working with Northern Electric's management to put in place a smooth transition."
"We are delighted by the outcome of the final offers for Northern Electric's shareholders," he said in a statement.
Northern Electric had no comment to make immediately after the result was published.
Last Friday's original bid deadline was extended to 1300 GMT on Tuesday after CE protested about share buys by Northern's advisers Schroders and BZW and a 250,000 pound fee to BZW not disclosed until Friday.
On Monday an appeal by Northern to reverse the deadline extension was rejected by the Takeover Panel, which polices mergers and acquisitions in the City of London.
Analysts said the takeover battle will leave a number of questions to be answered over the role of advisors.
The bid was the second hostile takeover that Northern had faced -- it spent 560 million pounds fending off Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner.
Northern, the first privatised power company to become a takeover target, initially received a billion pound bid from Trafalgar House at the end of 1994.
But the offer was scuppered when industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, announced plans for more stringent price controls, sending electricity share prices tumbling.
Northern's demise marks the tenth of the 12 cash-rich RECS privatised in 1990 to be taken over since they became available when the government's golden share expired in March 1995.
It is also the fourth to be taken over by an American company with two further agreed bids from U.S. firms Dominion Resources and Entergy for East Midlands and London respectively currently underway.
American companies are hotly tipped as the most likely buyers for the remaining RECs as they find the British regulatory environment more relaxed and see them as a useful springboard for expansion into Europe.
Among potential bidders, analysts named Houston Industries, which failed in its attempt to secure control of Norweb with Central &amp; South West Corp in October 1995.
Florida Power &amp; Light and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which have both been rumoured previously to be interested in Recs, are again being eyed as possible buyers.
Entergy of the U.S. has just clinched an agreed 1.267 billion pound deal to take over London Electricity, which provides power to the capital and its financial heart, the City.
The electricity companies have attracted harsh criticism from lobby groups and the British media over fat executive pay packets, shareholder payouts and spiralling takeover prices.
Lang's decision to clear CE Electric's bid on December 6 lifted a cloud from Northern's shares, which had been languishing around 600 pence. It also indicated that other bids might not face any regulatory hurdles.

If British regional electricity company (Rec) Northern Electric succumbs to a hostile 782 million pounds ($1.3 billion) bid from U.S. group CE Electric, it will be the tenth Rec of the 12 privatised in 1990 to be taken over.
Northern is the only Rec to have fought off a takeover, thwarting a bid from Trafalgar House, now part of Norway's Kvaerner, with a 560 million pound defence last year.
The bid from CE Electric, controlled by CalEnergy, has been vigorously opposed by Northern and closes at 1300 GMT on Friday. If the bid succeeds, it would take to six the number of Recs already in or due to move into U.S. hands.
Only two independent Recs would remain if Northern fell -- Southern and Yorkshire, which is the only one never to have attracted a firm bid.
Southern agreed to a takeover by generator National Power but this was blocked by the British government in April, along with fellow generator PowerGen's planned bid for Midlands.
Two Recs -- Norweb and South Wales Electricity (Swalec) -- were swallowed by their local water and sewerage firms to form multi-utilities while Manweb was taken over by generator Scottish Power, which later added Southern Water to its fold.
Eastern Electricity was bought by conglomerate Hanson, which intends to spin it off as part of its energy group.
Three Recs -- South Western, Seeboard and Midlands -- have already been bought by American firms and two more, London and East Midlands, have agreed to bids from U.S. companies.
The following table details bids in the electricity sector so far:
 Rec		   Bidder		 Value (stg)   Status

Electricity generator Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc turned in lower than expected half year profits on Thursday but hiked its dividend by 11 percent.
"We aim to keep on delivering dividend improvement...doing it by expanding the business," chief executive Roger Young told Reuters in an interview.
Pretax profits edged down to 61.3 million pounds ($101.6 million) from 61.7 million previously, below expectations of 63 to 70.7 million. The dividend was 5.28 pence per share.
The shares were down 1-1/2 pence at 316.5p at 1145 GMT.
Scottish Hydro said low rainfall had hit profits, as hydro-electric generation had been replaced in part by coal at a cost of 6.3 million pounds.
But chairman Lord Wilson (corrects name of chairman from Bob Reid) said in a statement that the second half had started well and he was confident of "an encouraging result for the full 12 month period."
Scottish Hydro said it was preferred bidder for the 50 percent stake in Keadby power station, northeast England, owned by United Utilities, its joint venture partner there, and aimed to complete the deal by the end of the current financial year.
Young said the plan would "increase costs but also increase profits", adding an extra 340 megaWatt of generation capacity to the company's existing portfolio.
Scottish Hydro said the deal should increase gearing to around 50 percent if it went ahead and added that together with existing expenditure commitments, gearing should peak at 65 percent in 1998-99.
"We are confident of the prospects for Keadby and look forward to the opportunity to exploit its capabilities in the market place," the company said in a statement.
Young said the company aimed to boost market share to seven percent from a current four percent by 1999 with a total investment in combined heat and power (CHP) plant for commercial customers of over 150 million pounds.
The company said that action taken to raise output and cut costs would improve performance over the next two to three years and added that raising standards was a key aim.
Scottish Hydro said that changes proposed to capital allowances in the British budget in November were expected to reverse a trend of falling tax rates but added it would not be possible to predict the impact accurately until full details were known.
The company will be looking to expand its domestic business, Young said, but a resumption of talks with British Gas on the sale of the latter's supply interests was unlikely, he added.
"I would not be optimistic of a resumption," he said.
British Gas announced in September that talks on the sale of its domestic gas supply business in England and Scotland to Scottish Hydro had been called off, scotching newspaper reports that the sale would bring in around 250 million pounds.
Young said the breakdown was for administrative rather than commerical reasons.
"There was no serious commercial difficulty that caused the project to be dropped...British Gas had a lot of competition for its (administrative) resources," he said.
But he said the moment for the deal might now have passed. "Deals tend to have their day," he said, adding that there . were other discussions around, "but nothing that we can talk about."

Troubled British stores group Sears Plc warned on Thursday that annual profits would fall below last year's levels and reported disappointing Christmas trading.
The news hit Sears shares and prompted analysts to say the group should be broken up.
"The corpse has clearly not responded to treatment and now they should do the decent thing, which is to break it up," said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Sears said in a statement that full-year pretax profits before exceptional items would be significantly below last year's 100.1 million pounds ($169 million) and added that Christmas same store sales slipped 0.5 percent from a year ago.
Shares, which had already fallen after The Guardian newspaper had said that profits would fall, closed down 4p, or 4.4 percent, at 87-1/2p after a low of 83.
Analysts said annual profit forecasts could now be trimmed back to around 80-90 million pounds from previous levels of around 110-120 million pounds.
But Sears's flagship London department store Selfridges performed well, with sales in the second half to January 6 up 8.6 percent, comparable with other retailers who have reported trading over the key Christmas period so far.
Clothing sales were also up, by eight percent in the period, with womenswear, which includes high street chains Wallis, Warehouse and Miss Selfridge, boosting sales by 14.3 percent.
But childrenswear saw turnover down four percent and footwear, Sears's persistent problem area, fell 2.8 percent at the start of the second half.
Sales at Sears's home shopping business Freemans slid 6.5 percent early in the second half and it said it expected to make an announcement soon on talks about selling the business to the privately-owned mail order-to-pools group Littlewoods.
Analysts have suggested that Freemans could be worth around 350 million pounds in such a deal, with some looking for a price of as much as 500 million.
"It is now all about the break-up value," said the analyst.
The company tried to ditch part of its British Shoe business last year but this was scuppered when the stores had to be taken back from retailer Facia after Facia's collapse in June 1996.
Analysts said Selfridges could be worth over 500 million pounds while a conservative valuation of one times turnover for the clothing business would mean a price of 600 million pounds.
"That means that the British Shoe business is seen by the market as a liability to the tune of around 200-300 million pounds," the analyst said.
He put a valuation of around 101-102 pence per share on Selfridges, the clothing business and the revenue from any sale of Freemans, around 19 percent above current share levels.
"I would hope they are going to do something radical, getting rid of British Shoe, even for a nominal sum, would free the company of that liability," the analyst said.
A flotation or sale of Selfridges is also seen as an option, or potentially a bid for the company although analysts said there were few likely buyers.
The company's poor performance could increase pressure for chief executive Liam Strong to quit, analysts said, after some five years at the helm trying to mend the group's fortunes.
Strong faced calls for his resignation in June from shareholders angry at the lack of progress in turning the sprawling retail business around. ($1=.5922 Pound)

British retail chain Kingfisher Plc said on Friday it would axe 1,200 jobs from the Norweb retail chain it bought in November 1996 and shut stores to integrate the purchase with its Comet electrical chain.
In a statement, Kingfisher said it would close 28 Norweb retail stores, which also sell electrical goods, along with 26 Comet stores and upgrade Comet out-of-town stores to raise the total number nationwide to 250 from a current 225 sites.
A further 26 Norweb retail stores in locations new to Comet would become Comet stores, Kingfisher said in a statement.
It added that Comet would go ahead with plans announced by Norweb retail last year before it was taken over to close all the chain's 57 high street sites at the beginning of March.
A further 26 Norweb retail stores in locations new to Comet will become Comet stores, Kingfisher said in a statement.
Norweb's total workforce before the job cuts numbers about 2,800.
"This acquisition is a good strategic move and will provide Comet with a significant number of first class retail locations and experienced people," said Kingfisher chief executive Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy.
Kingfisher bought Norweb retail for 51 million pounds ($85.30 million) from United Utilities, which had taken over regional electricity company Norweb around a year ago.
Kingfisher also announced on Friday that it had issued a 200 million pound bond, which analysts said was likely to be used for restructuring debt.
But some said the issue could focus attention again on reports earlier this week Kingfisher might increase its stake in French electrical retailer BUT, although BUT described an article in Thursday's Financial Times as "unfounded."
"The bond issue doesn't surprise me as it will help to restructure debt. But it will certainly focus attention on the BUT stake again," said one analyst who declined to be named.
Kingfisher declined to comment on the report on Thursday and there was no-one available to comment on Friday.
Kingfisher already holds a 26 percent stake in BUT and the Financial Times said on Thursday it was planning to mount a takeover offer, which the newspaper estimated could cost up to 300 million pounds.
Kingfisher bought the stake in BUT, which is France's second biggest furniture chain and fourth largest electricals group last year for 59 million pounds.
Under the deal, it should have to wait until 1998 before making any offer but analysts suggested this might be adjusted if Kingfisher were interested in raising its stake.
Analysts said such a move would be beneficial to Kingfisher.
"It would certainly be earnings enhancing in the first year," the analyst said.
He said Kingfisher would reap benefits from integrating BUT stores with its French electrical retailer Darty, which is the market leader. "Darty is star quality on electricals with higher returns on sales than Dixons," the British electrical retail chain, said the analyst.
"Combining the two could boost returns on BUT's electricals, which has turnover of around 500 million pounds but makes little profit," he added.
But analysts remained cautious that such a deal might be in the offing. "I don't think it will happen this year, I think they might have to wait until 1998," said one sector analyst.

The British supermarket group ASDA racked up a gain in first half results and sales on Thursday and analysts said there were signs of more to come.
"We thought this recovery story would come to an end sooner but there is still more upside, it seems," said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
ASDA, known for innovation and cheeky marketing initiatives, said pretax profits before exceptionals were 160.1 million pounds ($267 million), up from 138.3 million pounds ($230 million) a year ago, and paid out a dividend of 0.81 pence per share, up from 0.72 pence.
Sales from existing stores in the first half were 10.2 percent up on a year ago and ASDA edged up its market share by 0.5 points to 10.6 percent.
"Keeping it simple has been the key to our success. These results show we are on course to deliver...our (strategy) programme for 1998," chairman Archie Norman said in a statement.
ASDA's shares touched a high of 125 pence before edging back to be down 1/2 pence at 123.1/4 pence by 1103 GMT.
ASDA's sales gain is the highest in the industry for the period and comes on top of a strong rise a year ago.
"That is an extraordinary performance, double digit on double digit," said the analyst.
"One thing the market seems to have underestimated is how low the point was that ASDA recovered from," he added.
ASDA implemented a three-year "Renewal" strategy in the early 1990s aimed at turning the group round from huge debts and slow sales, which was followed this year by the start of a three-year "Breakout" strategy.
"I think the market thought Renewal was the recovery and it was over but that is not the case at all, they are carrying on the gains into Breakout," the analyst said.
ASDA said its aim to be the lowest on price had been achieved "with only a modest investment in our gross margn," as it moved to cut operating and distribution costs.
Leighton, who took over as chief executive from the entrepeneurial Norman in August, said second half margins were likely to be similar to those in the first six months, "down a bit, a smidgeon."
He said much of the impact in the first half had come from petrol, where a fierce price war has raged between supermarkets and oil companies, but pressures now seem to be easing.
ASDA is also trying to push its total sales to include more own-brand products where margins are generally higher.
It said own-brand goods now accounted for 35 percent of total sales, adding it was "well on our way to achieving our...objective of 40 percent ASDA brand penetration by 1998."
The company aims to open seven stores in the second half, which will all be large, "market hall" style, Leighton said, with similar opening levels on the cards for a couple of years..
Leighton said the company wanted the "critical mass" to drive growth markets of fresh food, entertainment, clothing and healthcare.
But he said the group was "under no pressure" to launch a loyalty card throughout the country, even though the other three major supermarkets -- J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway -- have all started schemes nationwide.
ASDA is testing a card in several stores but Leighton said ASDA customers tended to focus on price, quality and service. ($1=.6003 Pound)

British utility Northern Electric Plc made a last-ditch attempt Monday to remain independent by trying to overturn the extension of an offer by CE Electric that gives the U.S. company a majority of its shares.
Britain's takeover panel was meeting Monday to consider an application by Northern and its advisers BZW to appeal the board's unusual decision to extend the bid. The panel extended the deadline on the 782 million British pound ($1.3 billion) bid from Dec. 20 until Dec. 24.
The panel extended the fiercely fought bid on Friday in what newspaper reports said was a reaction to BZW's initial failure to disclose an extra 250,000 pound ($417,000) fee related to its performance in the bid.
"Following the investigation, the executive will consider what, if any, further action is appropriate," the panel said in a brief statement.

British regional electricity company (Rec) Northern Electric pumped up its defence against a 650 pence per share bid from CE Electric of the U.S. on Tuesday with promises of higher dividends and unit mergers.
The company expected a 17 percent rise in its year dividend to 50 pence per share with growth over seven percent from then to the end of the century, it said in a statement, adding it planned to merge its supply business with another Rec to find cost savings of over 28 million pounds ($46 million) a year.
"It's a fairly aggressive statement from Northern Electric showing they're preparing yet again to gear up to the gunwales," said Yamaichi utilities analyst Nigel Hawkins.
Northern spent 560 million pounds a year ago on a package of shareholder benefits to fight off Trafalgar House, now part of Kvaerner, and has strived to reduce its debt since.
"We are saying the company is worth at least as much as we said before...and clearly it is worth more than 650 pence per share," Northern chairman David Morris told Reuters.
CE Electric, which is 70 percent-owned by CalEnergy, decided to raise its bid from 630 pence per share on Friday and drew a deadline of December 20, just four days after UK Trade Secretary Ian Lang is expected to decide whether the bid may proceed.
Morris said Northern Electric would have a "broadly equal partnership" in its plans for merging its electricity supply business with another firm. He declined to name the Rec involved in talks but said it "may well not be a nearby one."
Neighbouring Yorkshire Electricity earlier on Tuesday told Reuters it had not held talks with Northern on the issue.
Northern has said a price of 700 pence was indicated before CE Electric launched its bid, a claim which the Americans have consistently denied.
The Rec rushed out half year results at the end of November and said its debt position should ease to around half previous expectations by March 1997 as it pushed for an increase in CE Electric's bid price.
"This is an exercise in re-arranging the deckchairs on the good ship scorched earth," said a spokesman for CE Electric, which has already secured 33.27 percent of its target.
Northern had also said it was in talks with a possible partner in its Sovereign upstream gas business, after it bought out its previous colleague Neste Oy last year.
Morris said this deal would be "imminent were there not a bid," but declined to name the company.
Shares in Northern struggled higher, up 8.5 pence to 614 pence by 0934 GMT, after touching a peak of 620 pence, as concerns the government might block the bid continued to weigh.
Seven of the original 12 cash-rich Recs set up at privatisation in 1990 have already been snapped up by predators, three to U.S. firms.
Of the remaining five, East Midlands Electricity has agreed to a $2.15 billion takeover by Dominion Resources of the U.S. while talks between U.S.-based Entergy and London Electric were called off last month.
Only two bids for Recs have so far been blocked by the UK. Generators National Power and PowerGen were banned from buying into the supply and distribution business through Southern Electric and Midlands Electricity respectively.
But there are concerns that the ruling pro-privatisation Conservative party might turn about face on current bids and block them in a bid for popularity. It trails the opposition Labour party in polls with a general election due by May 1997.
Privatised electricity companies have come under heavy criticism from lobby groups and politicians for hefty handouts to shareholders, bulging pay packets for executives and spiralling takeovers.

China said on Sunday it expected to reach formal agreement with Tokyo on the details of Japan's latest batch of huge yen loans but warned that politics should not be allowed to get in the way of economic aid.
A Japanese mission long delayed by diplomatic tensions reached basic agreement with Chinese officials last month on the projects to receive 180 billion yen ($1.6 billion) earmarked for the first year of Tokyo's 1996-2000 soft loan package.
Talks on the loans had been stalled for months, after disputes over territory, history and China's nuclear testing programme chilled ever-sensitive ties, Japanese sources say.
"Japan and China plan to sign a formal contract on the implementation of the 1996 yen loans," the official China Daily Business Weekly said in a front-page report.
The newspaper did not say when the loans would be finalised but quoted officials of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation as warning politics should not be allowed to intrude on Sino-Japanese economic relations.
Some Japanese were trying to use financial assistance to put political pressure on China, but such action was unacceptable and would bring no benefits to Tokyo, it quoted Yu Zhensheng of the ministry's foreign financing administration as saying.
"China is against political conditions attached to economic cooperation," Yu said. "We hope the two sides will make joint efforts to promote the healthy and steady development of Sino-Japanese economic ties."
The loans, scheduled to total 580 billion yen between 1996 and 2000, were a crucial part of the economic relationship, he said.
Soft loans from Tokyo are widely seen in China as an unofficial form of reparation for the damage inflicted by Japan's imperial army as it raged across the nation between 1931 and 1945.
Sino-Japanese ties have in recent years been strained by differences over nuclear testing, a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to a shrine to his nation's war dead and a territorial dispute over islands in the East China Sea.
Japan, the only nation to have suffered atomic attack, last year froze grant-in-aid to China in a largely symbolic protest against Beijing's nuclear testing programme.
The far larger yen loans were not officially affected by the nuclear protest, but the November mission was the first since China conducted a nuclear test in May 1995 and Japanese sources say the two issues had been privately linked.
Propaganda barrages in Chinese state media keep wartime memories fresh and officials rush to condemn all possible signs of resurgent Japanese militarism, but diplomats say Beijing is keen to avoid threatening a vital economic relationship.
Japan had promised 1,610 billion yen worth of loans between 1979 and 1995, accounting for 40 percent of the total foreign government loans promised to China during the period, China Daily Business Weekly said.
The loans themselves have been a source of dispute, with the rise in the value of the yen in 1994 and 1995 sending their cost soaring. That prompted Chinese complaints and demands to be allowed to repay in U.S. dollars.
Tokyo refused, but the yen's later decline has blunted the issue as a potential source of conflict, and both sides have in recent months shown new willingness to restore amicable ties.

China and the United States signed a new textile agreement on Sunday in an eleventh-hour deal that ended the threat of a cross-Pacific trade war and was hailed by both sides as a breakthrough.
U.S. officials said their main achievement was gaining assured access for the first time to Chinese textile markets, adding that it also granted China a U.S. import quota slightly larger than the previous 1994 textile pact.
Millions of dollars in penalties slapped by Washington on Chinese imports remained in force under the deal, although Beijing had agreed to withdraw its threat of retaliation, top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said after the signing.
"For the first time the United States has market access with China...and this is something we felt very strongly about," Hayes told reporters. "It is now a situation that we have a level playing field."
The four-year textile accord was signed by Hayes and Li Dongsheng, China's chief negotiator and director of the trade management department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
Officials of both sides welcomed the deal, which was hammered out during negotiations that ran far beyond their original three-day schedule to become a gruelling six-day marathon topped by all-night sessions.
"After six days of hard work, the delegations have reached a rather ideal conclusion," said Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, who attended the signing ceremony.
Officials of both sides declined to give details of the accord, but Hayes said it would create U.S. jobs by allowing exports while slightly increasing China's U.S. import quota.
The talks focused on renewal of the 1994 textile accord and resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, with market access for U.S. goods to China also a major stumbling block, officials said.
Breakthrough came during a one-day extension to the final deadline for renewal of the Sino-U.S. accord, which had originally been scheduled to expire on Dec. 31 but was extended by one month to allow time to reach a compromise.
"I think this morning at the beginning we were unhappy with each other, but now we have become friends," U.S. negotiator Li told Hayes during the signing of the accord.
The accord ended the threat of a Sino-U.S. trade war, which had loomed after Washington slapped $19 million in penalties on Chinese imports last September, accusing Beijing of shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China had threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but delayed the action to allow time for further talks.
After the signing of the textile accord, Beijing announced it was calling off its retaliatory measures, but U.S. negotiator Hayes said Washington's penalties remained in force.
"The transshipment charges that were made in September still stand as they did," she said without elaborating.
Access to China's huge and growing markets was also an issue in other Sino-U.S. meetings in Beijing last week.
U.S. trade official Lee Sands held two days of talks in the Chinese capital to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of bilateral friction.
"The agreement is once again proof that China and the United States can settle their trade disputes through negotiations based on equality and mutual benefits," said negotiator Li.

China and the United States reached agreement on Sunday to extend a deal on textiles, averting a multi-billion dollar trade war, an official with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said.
"The two sides will be signing the agreement in a ceremony shortly," the official said by telephone.
The eleventh-hour agreement followed marathon all-night talks between U.S. chief textile negotiator Rita Hayes and a team of Chinese officials on renewal of a 1994 textile accord and resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese textile exports.
Hayes had said on Saturday she was confident of accord in last-ditch talks after extending by a day a January 31 deadline for multi-million dollar penalties on China's exports.
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Hayes said earlier issues at the forefront in the final rounds of talks were two major demands -- the U.S. market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.
Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier.
Washington could have made significant cuts to China's textile quotas if an agreement had not been reached before the deadline.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in the dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries.

China's move at the weekend to make the yuan convertible under the current account is cause for celebration among traders and businessmen, but Beijing's goal of full convertibility is still far off, analysts said on Monday.
News that the yuan had been made convertible under the current account from Sunday was little more than the final seal on a long process of currency liberalisation, but would be welcomed by traders and investors alike, they said.
"This announcement is more symbolic than substantial... because foreign and domestic investors have had easy access to swap centres and foreign exchange banks," said one investment analyst in Shanghai who declined to be identified.
The formalisation of increased convertibility was welcome and was also a vital step in China's long-delayed application for entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), said Adam Williams, chief representative of Jardine Fleming in Beijing.
"It's cause to celebrate," Williams said. "This is not full convertibility, but it's a fair step towards it... It's good for everybody."
State media has quoted central bank governor Dai Xianglong as saying December 1 marked formal Chinese compliance on current account convertibility under the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Article VIII.
Article VIII is an undertaking to refrain from imposing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, or from engaging in discriminatory currency arrangements.
Current account convertibility covers payment for trade in merchandise and services such as shipping, banking and tourism, as well as private transfers -- although analysts said currency conversion by ordinary Chinese remained restricted.
The analysts said China had long since dismantled the main barriers to IMF recognition of current account convertibility, leaving only technical issues to be resolved in recent weeks.
Beijing's move mainly signalled its confidence in the yuan's stability -- with foreign reserves at more than $100 billion -- and in the new-found efficacy of its macro-economic controls, said a Chinese analyst at a foreign bank in Beijing.
The official Xinhua news agency has quoted government experts as predicting stability for the yuan, arguing that the decision to boost convertibility reflected the smooth running of China's new currency exchange system since January 1994.
While China had come a long way in loosening controls on its currency, the final goal of full convertibility was still a distant one, the analysts said.
Central bank governor Dai told Reuters in a recent interview that China still needed a "fairly long period" before making the yuan convertible under the capital account and there was no timetable for doing so.
"The next step is convertibility on the capital account, which I would say is a fair way down the road yet," said one Beijing-based foreign analyst.
Beijing was concerned that large flows of funds could upset financial and stock markets and wanted to avoid a Mexican-style currency crisis, said a Western banker in Shanghai.
"Many capitalist countries in Asia, like Taiwan and South Korea, have foreign exchange controls so it is understandable for China to keep stringent foreign exchange controls," he said.

A World Trade Organisation (WTO) without China is a global trade body with a missing limb, but the world's most populous nation still must meet basic criteria before gaining entry, a British minister said on Thursday.
A robust approach could be taken to Beijing's application for WTO membership, Ian Lang, president of Britain's Board of Trade, told a news conference in the Chinese capital.
"A WTO without China would be a WTO with a limb missing," Lang said in an speech to Chinese and British businessmen that was released to reporters at the news conference.
"We very much support China's application to join the WTO. However, we also believe that China's accession must be on the right terms," Lang said.
"It has to be...on the same terms on which other countries have membership of the WTO," Lang told the news conference. "It is important not to dilute the strength of the WTO."
Beijing has been seeking to join the global trade body with developing country status, but some Western nations maintain that China's economy is too big to warrant such treatment.
"I understand the anxieties that China has, it...still feels it has a considerable way to go in some areas," Lang said.
"There are certain fundamental elements to approaching membership of the WTO that can be approached fairly robustly," he said. He cited trade transparency, market access, tariffs and legal structures as areas that needed further exploration.
A WTO working group will meet later this year in Geneva to try to negotiate a deal that would allow China's accession, but China said last month its prospects appeared bleak.
Lang said China and Britain were expected to sign a memorandum of understanding next month that would let Chinese companies list on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
Many cash-strapped Chinese companies are keen to apply for listing on overseas markets, but Chinese securities officials say agreement with the LSE has been long delayed by disputes between London and Beijing over Hong Kong.
Some 20 Chinese companies are listed in Hong Kong while a handful are traded in New York.
Lang said Sino-British ties were continuing to warm following high-level exchanges this year.
Relations between Beijing and London have been tested in recent years by disputes over the mid-1997 return of Hong Kong, now a British colony, to Chinese rule.

A ministerial conference of Mekong River nations on Friday agreed to push forward cross-border cooperation to build a prosperous future for the once war-torn region.
Growing trust among the six nations of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) would allow huge investment in what was being dubbed the "last frontier of economic development", said Bong-Suh Lee, Asian Development Bank (ADB) vice president.
"We can expect such investment to grow rapidly and reach a target of at least $1.3 billion by the turn of the century," Lee told a news conference after the meeting in China's southwestern Kunming city.
Ministers of Burma, Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam agreed at the conference to pursue development of infrastructure projects aimed at knitting together a region long divided by bitter distrust and war.
The ministers approved work to map out strategies for the next 25 years of development along the mighty Mekong River.
The ADB, which backs the GMS programmes, had prepared $300 million in loans ready for investment in the region over the next three years, Lee told the conference.
Far greater sums would be needed to finance crucial projects such as a road connecting Bangkok to Phnom Penh and Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, said Gunther Hecker of the ADB's transport and communication department.
"The $300 million is the trigger element for others to follow," Hecker told Reuters. "We lay the seeds."
Lee said at least $9 billion would be needed to finance transport and telecommunications projects in the region, home to around 230 million people, and added that the private sector was appearing more willing to contribute.
"I have heard from many private investors that probably the GMS is the last frontier of economic development," he said.
Investor enthusiasm is relatively new to much of the Mekong River region, which was riven for decades by conflicts over ideology and borderlines.
China and Vietnam clashed repeatedly in the 1980s after a bloody border conflict in 1979.
Vietnamese troops fought Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia through the late 1980s while fighting was far from rare among many of the region's other borders.
GMS meetings had been vital in building trust in the region, conference participants said.
Priority GMS projects include a Kunming-to-Bangkok highway, a fibre-optic cable telecommunications loop through Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia and action to curb deforestation on the Mekong's upper reaches.
Ministers at the conference said the ADB should continue its role as organiser of regional projects but agreed on the need for closer coordination with other potential investors from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other nations.
How coordination would be organised was not decided in detail, but observer Finn Nielsen of the World Bank said huge funding requirement in the region meant there was little chance of a turf war breaking out among development investors.
"There are more projects here than the ADB, the World Bank or anyone can handle, so that isn't a problem," Nielsen said.

Britain's final departure next year from its colony of Hong Kong will be sealed with a handshake, a British minister said on Tuesday, confirming the two countries would share one final last symbolic embrace.
Beijing's top Hong Kong policymaker had indicated he was willing to join the British territory's last imperial governor at a ceremony to mark its return to China, said Jeremy Hanley, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Chinese official Lu Ping's willingness to join Britain's Governor Chris Patten in the limelight appeared to signal new willingness to set aside differences in the run-up to the colony's return to Beijing rule on July 1, 1997.
"I had confirmation from Lu Ping this morning that he is looking forward to shaking the governor's hand at the handover ceremony," Hanley told a news conference in Beijing.
London and Beijing have long bickered over the arrangements for Hong Kong's mid-1997 transition to Chinese rule after more than 150 years, with disagreement over the handover ceremony once so entrenched that the prospects for a joint event seemed doubtful.
Beijing, infuriated by Patten's drive to expand democracy in the colony ahead of its return, has tried to limit Britain's role, while London is keen to leave in imperial style.
Britain in March signaled that a joint ceremony was in doubt, with diplomatic sources reporting that the main hurdle in talks was China's insistence that Patten should not attend.
Hong Kong government radio reported late last month that Chinese and British negotiators could reach an outline agreement on the ceremony by the end of September, just nine months before the end of London's rule.
A willingness to share the podium with the governor could reflect a muting of Chinese anger at Patten, who has long been the butt of scathing editorials in the Beijing media.
Lu Ping has frequently shown reluctance to meet Patten during visits to the colony, although he has often had conferences with other British and Hong Kong officials.
Hanley said differences remained to be settled on handover arrangements, but added progress had been made.
"We've had very useful discussions," he said.
"On the handover ceremony, the Chinese government agree that it should be grand, solemn and dignified, and fitting to the historical importance of the event," Hanley said.
Britain and China say relations have warmed in recent months, boosted by high-level exchanges and a May trade visit to Beijing by British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine.
Differences remained over China's determination to scrap Hong Kong's elected legislature, known as Legco, Hanley said.
"It is unnecessary for Legco, which has been duly elected, to be replaced before the end of its term in 1999," he said.
While Hanley called for urgency to resolve outstanding disagreements before the 1997 handover, China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Lu Ping as saying "minor differences" did not necessarily have to be ironed out before the day arrived.
"We will try our best to solve minor differences before the first of July, 1997. If some of the differences cannot be solved by that day, it doesn't matter," Lu said. "They can be resolved gradually by the Hong Kong people themselves."

China's jailing of leading dissident Wang Dan is clear evidence of the kind of abuse that this week led a U.S. report to condemn Beijing for its rights record, the former student leader's father said on Friday.
All nations had the right and responsibility to concern themselves with human rights in other countries, said Wang Xianzeng, whose son was last year sentenced to 11 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.
"In Wang Dan's case, I know... the human rights situation is very bad," Wang Xiangzeng told Reuters by telephone.
"If (the United States) is seeking the truth in its concern with the Chinese human rights situation, then that is as it ought to be," he said.
In an annual human rights report on 193 countries released on Thursday, the United States accused China of effectively silencing public dissent against the government by detaining, jailing or driving into exile all known dissidents.
This year's hard-hitting report was released amid a dramatic improvement in Sino-U.S. ties that have long been rocked by disputes over issues ranging from rights to trade to Taiwan.
Analysts say Beijing, which stayed silent on the U.S. report on Friday and has recently reacted with uncharacteristic mildness to U.S. concerns over human rights and Hong Kong, is eager to keep up the positive momentum in cross-Pacific ties.
The recent Sino-U.S. rapprochement last October survived Wang Dan's jailing after a four-hour trial that was denounced by human rights activists as a politically-orchestrated sham.
Wang Xianzeng said his son, a former leader of 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the army, had done nothing to justify the harsh sentence meted out by judges of the Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court.
"Nothing Wang Dan did...offended against the laws of China, as his parents we cannot agree with such a heavy sentence and we cannot accept the verdict," Wang Xianzeng said.
He said both he and Wang Dan's mother, 61-year-old museum researcher Wang Lingyun, planned to visit their son next month at his prison in Jinzhou city in China's Liaoning province.
Wang, who served four years in jail for his role in the 1989 protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, was still suffering from numerous medical complaints that could not be treated at his draughty jail in China's frigid northeast, his father said.
"(Wang Dan) suffers many illnesses...they can't cope with serious complaints although they can deal with small problems or colds," he said.
Wang Dan was one of China's most articulate political dissenters between his parole from the 1989 sentence until he vanished into detention in May 1995.
His jailing and the later dismissal of his appeal were part of a series of hammer blows last year that all but silenced China's tiny band of pro-democracy activists.
U.S. officials have said human rights remain an important influence on Sino-U.S. relations, but have made clear that no one issue will be allowed to derail warming ties with Beijing.
China was not the only target of the U.S. State Department report, which also found problems with the rights records of allies Turkey, South Korea and Germany as well as Russia, Indonesia, Haiti and Nigeria.
Wang Xianzeng said it was only right for the international community to take an interest in the human rights records of different nations -- adding such interest could be mutual.
"China can also concern itself with human rights in the United States, can it not?" he said.

More than 250 Chinese citizens have called on Beijing's top military leaders to take tough action in a dispute with Tokyo over a group of islands in the East China Sea, a petition organiser said on Sunday.
Beijing should send Chinese forces to the disputed Diaoyu Islands, known in Japan as the Senkakus, to destroy a makeshift lighthouse built there by a right-wing Japanese group in July, organiser Tong Zeng said in a telephone interview.
"We are calling for troops to be sent to get rid of the Japanese lighthouse," Tong said. "Japan has violated our territorial integrity...we are very angry."
The rare petition was addressed to Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and chairman of the Central State Military Commission, and to other top military leaders. It had been signed by 257 ordinary citizens, Tong said.
Petitioners included officials, retired servicemen, workers and students, he said.
Tong is a leading anti-Japanese campaigner in China whose high-profile approach led authorities to confiscate his passport and order him to leave Beijing temporarily during last year's 50th anniversary of the Japanese surrender.
Beijing and its arch-rival, Chinese Nationalist-ruled Taipei, both claim the Diaoyu Islands, which are located about 300 km (190 miles) west of Okinawa and 200 km (125 miles) east of Taiwan.
Tokyo says the uninhabited group has always been part of Japan.
The dispute over the islands' ownership flared in July after the Nihon Seinen-sha (Japan Youth Federation) moved to buttress Japan's claims by building an aluminium lighthouse on one of them, prompting howls of protest from China's state media.
"The Chinese side must take strong and concrete action to protect our nation's territorial integrity," the Chinese petitioners wrote in their appeal to Beijing.
The military should immediately remove the five-metre (16-ft) Japanese lighthouse, or at least should send warships to protect any Taiwanese or Hong Kong groups who attempted to destroy it, they said.
While China's Communist Party-controlled media quickly condemns any perceived signs of resurgent Japanese militarism, Beijing has in the past suppressed unofficial protests against Tokyo and campaigns for Japanese compensation for war victims.
Petitions to parliament judged hostile to the government have often prompted the detention of signatories, but Tong said the Diaoyu petition was a private move by ordinary people that would be welcomed by the Beijing leadership.
"There is nothing wrong with this action, this is to protect China," he said. "I think the government could not but welcome it."

China and the United States made progress Thursday in talks on a new textile accord but negotiations could stretch late into the night on the last day before a deadline for agreement, a U.S. trade official said.
"We hope to complete the talks tonight," chief negotiator Rita Hayes said after talks Thursday morning with officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
Progress had been made on market access, she said. But the two sides still had a long way to go on the third day of talks to renew a 1994 textile accord and resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports, she said.
Washington could make significant cuts in China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the Jan. 31 deadline, Hayes said.
"We still have a lot of issues, so that means a lot of work today, probably late into the night," she said. "We are not going to give China another extension because we have already given them another month."
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on Dec. 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries. The United States has threatened multi-million dollar penalties and raised the specter of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue.
"I am always optimistic and I am in hopes that we will complete the round today ... but that is something both sides have to work very hard on," Hayes said.
If an agreement was not reached in time, past practice showed that the United States could cut China's textile import quota significantly until a deal was struck, she said.
"I am in hopes that it won't come to that. China doesn't want it to come to that -- and certainly the States doesn't," she said.
In Washington, acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Wednesday that the talks were proceeding fairly well.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Textiles are just one of a range of issues dogging the Sino-U.S. relationship, which has long been strained by disputes over topics ranging from trade to human rights to Taiwan.
A U.S. delegation arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for talks on human rights with Chinese officials, after a year in which almost all remaining members of the nation's tiny pro-democracy movement have been either imprisoned or driven into exile.
U.S. trade official Lee Sands began talks in Beijing on Thursday to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation, long a source of cross-Pacific friction.
Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry.
Hayes said a key U.S. requirement was further opening of China's protected markets. "What we are asking China for is upfront market access, before they join the WTO. We are still working out those differences."

General Motors Corp. said Tuesday its fourth quarter earnings fell by more than half as labour strife in the second half of the year cost it $700 million in profits.
The world's largest automaker earned $786 million, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $1.59 billion, or $1.95 a share, in the 1995 fourth quarter. All figures exclude results from Electronic Data Systems Corp., which was spun off last June.
Revenues fell to $40.95 billion from $41.35 billion.
For all of 1996, GM earned $4.95 billion, or $6.06 a share, down from $6.03 billion, or $7.14 a share. Revenues for the year rose to $164.1 billion from $160.3 billion.
Workers from the United Auto Workers union and Canadian Auto Workers union struck GM last fall after talks broke down on a new three-year contract. In March 1996, a UAW strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants crippled GM's North American production for more than two weeks.
All told, GM said work stoppages in the United States and Canada reduced its full-year earnings by $1.2 billion on an after-tax basis.
"Clearly our 1996 fourth-quarter and calendar-year results were impacted by the strike-related production losses in the United States and Canada and are not indicative of GM's potential for continued profit improvement," GM Chairman John Smith said.
The strikes also took a bite out of the 1996 profit sharing checks for GM's union workers. GM said 282,000 represented workers in the United States will receive about $300 each -- less than half of the $800 each received last year.
GM said 76,000 eligible salaried workers will receive 1996 incentive payments, with payments rising with the level of pay and responsibility. By comparison, Chrysler Corp. announced last week its U.S. workers will each receive an average of $7,900 in profit sharing.
GM's 1996 fourth quarter results included several one-time accounting items, including a $157 million loss on the sale of four Delphi parts plants to Peregrine Inc. and a $167 million charge for lump sum payments to UAW members as part of its new labour contract.
Including the strike-related effects, the one-time items brought down GM's fourth quarter earnings by $762 million, or 99 cents a share. However, the fourth quarter also included a separate, favourable tax gain of $262 million.
GM's North American operations, its core automotive group in the United States, had a net loss of $124 million vs. a profit of $603 million in the year-ago quarter. For the year, the North American unit, which includes Delphi Automotive Systems, earned $1.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion.
The automaker's international operations reported net income of $353 million for the quarter, down from $498 million a year ago. For all of 1996, GM's international profits were $1.5 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 1995.
Worldwide car and truck deliveries from GM dealers for the quarter were 1.9 million units vs. 2.02 million a year earlier. That reduced the automaker's worldwide market share to 15.5 percent for the quarter from 17.3 percent.
GM's U.S. market share also fell, to 30.2 percent in the fourth quarter from 33.5 percent a year ago. Unit deliveries in the United States were 1.08 million down from 1.20 million.
In his statement, Smith also blamed the lower 1996 results on production changeovers, higher advertising and "consumer-influence" expenses related to new-product launches. The average U.S. retail incentive for the fourth quarter was $739 a vehicle, up from $518.
"We have more new cars and trucks going into the market now than any time in the last 15 years," he said. "In fact, about 20 percent of the 1997 production will be for the new models launched in 1996. Those new cars and trucks are key to our plans to aggressively increase market share in the United States this year."
GM stock was down $1 at $60.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Ford Motor Co's long-shot bid to sit down first with the United Auto Workers union paid off, but analysts wondered Wednesday what the automaker had to give up in exchange for being the Big Three's lead-off negotiator.
"Everyone wants to be first, and that's obviously a plus for Ford in that regard," said J.P. Morgan analyst David Bradley. "The question is, what price did they have to pay to be first?"  
Since January, analysts and other auto industry observers believed Chrysler Corp would be the UAW's choice to start contract talks, although last month some thought General Motors Corp had a good shot.
Union officials acknowledged Tuesday that Ford was selected, but they declined to comment beyond that. Ford executives also declined to comment other than to say the automaker is "encouraged" by the tone of the talks.
Analysts speculated Ford may have expressed some willingness to help union organizing efforts among its supply base.  
That would address job security issues that are crucial to the UAW as the union faces a shrinking membership base.
In return, the union may have agreed to consider a contract that spans more than the traditional three years.
"I think (Ford) would love to have a five or six year agreement," said Michael Ward, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. "It strengthens Ford's position with the UAW."
A big unknown is how willing Ford is to limit the number of components it buys from outside suppliers, a process known as outsourcing.  
But James Harbour, president of Troy, Mich.-based industry consultant Harbour and Associates Inc, said Ford does not have the breadth of engineering talent to bring large numbers of parts in-house.
"I think probably the biggest thing they could give them is to say we'll work with suppliers and ask them to join the union," said Harbour.  "Membership is the issue this year."
Not being the lead-off company has in the past been bad news for the two automakers not selected because of the pattern style of bargaining that imposed terms on them.
But analysts said that is not necessarily the case this time.  
Unlike prior years, negotiations are continuing with GM and Chrysler.  And there are signs the traditional pattern process is no longer as firm as it used to be.
Bradley noted that by holding out, GM has also not lost any negotiating power. "For now, GM is powder-dry.  They haven't given up any leverage, which they would have had to do to be first," he said.
In picking Ford, which employs about 104,000 UAW members, the union starts with a company that is recognized as having the best labor relations among the Detroit's Big Three.
Analysts said the relative labor peace has given Ford better work rules and allows it more flexibility to use overtime to increase production.  It also has spared the company costly strikes that have hit GM and Chrysler.
The downside, according to Wall Street analysts, is that Ford has not been as aggressive in farming out work to less expensive outside suppliers -- something GM is focusing on.

Ford Motor Co. halted light truck assembly lines at three plants Friday as planned because of a strike at a seat supplier, but signed up another company to help it clear out the backlog of 7,700 Expeditions built without proper seats.
Following an appeal from Ford Chairman Alex Trotman, Lear Corp. Chairman Kenneth Way agreed to have his company make seats for Ford's Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle once the walkout is settled, according to sources in the supply industry.
Under the arrangement, Lear, which already is a large Ford supplier, would make second and third row seats for the Expedition, said Donna Parolini, president of International Business Development Corp., a consulting firm in Troy, Mich.
Front seats for the vehicles are being made by Ford's Chesterfield, Mich., trim plant, Ford officials have said. Ford spokesman Bert Serre said the plant has been making a limited number of seats, less than 20 an hour.
Ford suspended all production at its Michigan Assembly in Wayne, which makes the Expedition and F-Series pickup trucks, after the United Auto Workers and Johnson Controls Inc. failed to settle a strike, which entered its 11th day Friday.
Ohio plants affected were the Econoline and Club Wagon full-size van assembly line in Lorain and a frame production line at Ohio Assembly in Avon Lake. About 6,800 workers were idled as a result of the action.
Industry analysts said the strike has Ford in a huge bind. The Expedition is one of its most profitable and popular vehicles, earning Ford an estimated pre-tax profit of $10,000 each. Under normal production, it makes 840 vehicles at day Michigan Truck, the only plant where the Expedition is made.
But to avoid angering its own UAW workers, Ford refused to accept seats made by non-union replacement workers. It had been making the vehicles with temporary seats. But after making about 14,800 Expeditions and Econolines without proper seats, Ford decided to shut production down completely.
"To interrupt Expedition production for any extended period of time would hurt Ford financially in North America," said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich.
Because Ford and Lear do not want to provoke the UAW, Lear, which has unionized plants, would not start producing seats until the strike is over, said Parolini. Another issue prohibiting Lear from making seats immediately is the fact that it buys seat frames from the same Johnson Controls facility that assembles seats for Ford.
Shutting down Expedition production means an extension of the three- to six-month wait that many consumers already face. Introduced last fall, the Expedition has been a huge hit with buyers looking for a sleek, larger sport utility.
"The reception of this vehicle has been the highest of anything I've seen since the original Mustang," said Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the largest Ford dealers in the country.
About 500 UAW members struck Johnson Controls seat plants January 28 in Plymouth, Mich., and Oberlin, Ohio, when talks broke down on a new contract.
Jeff Steiner, a spokesman for Johnson Controls' automotive unit, said no talks occurred Friday after they broke off late Thursday. No new negotiations were scheduled for the weekend.
Steiner declined to characterize the discussions, which have restarted and collapsed several times since the strike began over terms for a new contract.

Investigators fought frigid, wind-blown snow on Friday trying to recover the remains of 28 adults and one infant killed when a commuter plane crashed into a field and left a blackened crater.
John Hammerschmidt, senior member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters the cockpit voice and flight recorders had not been recovered but that he was sure they would eventually be found.
The devices usually provide investigators with detailed information on the final seconds before a crash.
Hampering the search for both human and aircraft remains were temperatures falling to near zero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius) and ground blizzards that created near white-out conditions. Workers were able to stay in the wooded field for no more than 15 to 20 minutes at a time, he said.
"There is a crater out there" hiding some of the wreckage, he said, including propellers, engines and engine assemblies from the 30-seat, Brazilan-built Embraer 120 operated by Delta Comair.
In addition, eight-foot (2.5 metre) high brush covered with snow from the storm during which the plane crashed on Thursday made recovery efforts difficult, Hammerschmidt said.
"There are remains just all around the entire scene," he said. Local police had removed some of the remains to a morgue and families of some of the victims were taken to a nearby motel, where teams of counsellors were on hand.
Hammerschmidt said the 28 adults and one "babe in arms" aboard the twin-engine propjet lifted off from Cincinnati at 2:53 p.m. EST, and the plane crashed and 3:52 p.m. during its approach to Detroit's Metropolitan Airport.
He said the pilot, Dann Carlsen, 43, of Williamstown, Kentucky, was very experienced and was a flight instructor. He also said the plane was equipped with de-icing systems for the wings, the leading edge of the propellers and for the engines.
Hammerschmidt refused to speculate on whether ice was a factor in the crash. USA Today said a pilot in the vicinity reported icing conditions at about the same altitude the doomed plane was flying minutes before it crashed.
The Cincinnati Post quoted an unidentified Comair pilot on Friday as saying the Embraer 120 can suffer wing icing problems despite a system designed to break up ice through a pneumatic rubber strip on the wing that is inflated and deflated in bad weather.
Michael Bragg, a professor of aeronautical and astronautical engineering at the University of Illinois in Champaign, told Reuters that some eyewitness accounts of the crash point to a "classic horizontal tail stall."
Such stalls have long been considered a problem with smaller propjet planes, he said. Ice on the the horizontal part of the tale can disrupt the airflow that keeps a plane flying level. When flaps are deployed in such a situation, Bragg said, the plane stalls and dives.

Workers striking two Johnson Control Inc. seat assembly plants Tuesday scored a major victory when Ford Motor Co. said it would refuse to accept non-union made seats until the dispute is resolved.
"We had a huge, huge victory here today," Bob King, director of United Auto Worker Region 1A, told a boisterous crowd of strikers and supporters outside of the plant in Plymouth, Mich., a suburb west of Detroit.
More than 300 workers at the plant walked off the job at 6 a.m. Tuesday after talks on a new contract broke down late Monday. The strike drew hundreds of other chanting supporters.
About 200 employees of a Johnson Controls seat plant in Oberlin, Ohio, also struck the company when their talks collapsed. Workers at both plants agreed last fall to be represented by the UAW in a new labour contract.
The Plymouth plant provides final assembly for seats that go into Ford's hot-selling Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, which is made at the nearby Michigan Truck plant in Wayne, Mich. The Ohio plant makes seats for Ford's Econoline full-size vans.
Johnson Controls officials did not return telephone calls. In a statement, the company said it will make "every effort" to continue seat production at both plants, including hiring temporary and permanent replacement workers, if necessary.
Representatives from Ford said they had to consider their own union workforces when they were affected by supplier disputes. Ford is generally regarded as having the best labour relations of Detroit's Big Three.
"We're not accepting seats made by the non-union employees of Johnson Controls," said Ford spokesman Bill Carroll.
As of midday Tuesday, no new talks were scheduled.
UAW spokesman Karl Mantyla said the union was seeking wage parity with other seat suppliers, such as Lear Corp. which pays hourly wages of $14 to $16. Mantyla would not say what Johnson offered, but said the company "did not get close to that."
The UAW is also pressing for resolution of unfair labour practice claims. After workers agreed to be represented by the UAW, Mantyla said Johnson dropped its entry pay rate to $9 an hour from $9.50, cut out a 401(k) retirement plan, and barred union supporters from displaying UAW buttons at company meetings.
In its statement, the company said the UAW rejected what Johnson termed a reasonable and fair offer.

If Miss Manners, the nation's arbiter of proper taste and decorum, can find good things to say about car dealers, then the industry must be doing something right.
That was the message John Peterson, outgoing president of the National Automobile Dealers Association, delivered on Saturday in a speech that railed against the media and others who say traditional car dealerships are on the way out.
"It's time we stood up for what our industry is doing right out there," said Peterson. "So, to our friends in the media, I say take a tip from one of your own, Miss Manners, and park that old stereotype of fast-talking salesmen in plaid coats and white bucks."
According to Peterson, Miss Manners, whose real name is Judith Martin, wrote a column in 1996 after she shopped for a new car in which she said she was "astonished" at the "dignified courtesy" she found at a dozen dealerships she visted.
Peterson spoke at the opening day of the NADA's 80th annual convention and equipment exposition.
In his remarks, Peterson acknowledged the traditional dealer franchise system is facing numerous challenges from the explosive growth of used car superstores such as CarMax and AutoNation USA.
But he said traditional franchised dealers will remain the dominant system for selling new cars and trucks. In a year when the superstores grew rapidly, Peterson said franchised dealers boosted sales by three percent, increased profits by 25 percent, and finished the year with 23,000 dealerships in operation.
Of the approximately 15 million new light vehicles expected to be sold in 1997, 14.5 million will be sold by the current franchise system.
Peterson also took issue with critics who say car dealers do not respond to customers, saying a recent survey by the Newspaper Association of America indicated that more than 90 percent of new-vehicle buyers are satisified or very satisfied.
"No business is more poked at, picked at, anaylzed, written about and castigated for failing to live up to performance standards that no other business in the country is expected to meet," said Peterson.
In the NADA's keynote speech, Toyota Motor Corp's top executive in the U.S. told the audience that franchised new-car dealers will continue to be the cornerstone of the U.S. automotive retailing industry.
Yale Gieszel, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc, said consumers -- and not auto superstores -- are driving the changes rocking the business.
"Large retail chains or automobile department stores are not the answer to the challenges we face. The current franchise system will not only survive, it will flourish," he said.
At a news conference afterward, Gieszel said he does not believe the large superstore chains can reap enough economies of scale that they can outperform local franchises. Gieszel also said Toyota is not convinced the large superstores can offer the close customer attention that individual dealers can.

Investigators of Thursday's Delta Comair crash were trying to determine on Saturday the nature of what they called "an unexplained event" shortly before the plane plummeted to the ground killing 29 people.
"Approximately one minute after leveling off at 4,000 ft (1,200 m) an unexplained event took place, normal operations ceased and the airplane crashed shortly thereafter," John Hammerschmidt, the National Transportation Safety Board chief spokesman told a news conference.
"At this juncture, it is an event we are trying to understand," he added.
NTSB investigators said they had determined something happened from listening to the "black box" cockpit voice recorder, but they refused to tell reporters what the pilots said.
Investigators were still reviewing the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder boxes at their laboratory in Washington D.C., said Hammerschmidt, who added that nothing had been ruled out in trying to determine the cause.
"The cockpit voice recorder indicated an uneventful routine orderly businesslike flight," he added.
Flight 3272 was enroute to Detroit from Cincinnati when it went down about 25 miles (40 kms) south of the airport in rural Monroe County in southeast Michigan on Thursday, killing 28 adults and one infant.
Hammerschmidt said eye-witnesses reported seeing the plane's wings rock (corrects from "lock") before it plunged out of the sky.
He said there was apparently a large amount of wing rocking (corrects from "locking") after which the plane briefly stabilised.
"They all indicated that the airplane stabilised, then the nose of the aircraft abruptly pitched down and descended vertically to the ground," he said.
Hammerschmidt said the NTSB had learned that 20 minutes after the crash the pilot of a DC3 aircraft reported icing 25 miles southwest of Detroit airport.
He said the previous crew of the doomed plane had on at least two occasions earlier in the day successfully used the entire de-icing system of the plane.
He said there were no strong winds at the time of the accident, cloud cover was at 1500 feet (457.2 metres) and visibility was one to three miles (1.6 to 4.8 km).
(Corrects cloud cover figures from 15,000 feet (4,570 metres).)
Capt. Dann Carlsen had a total of 5,329 flight hours and his co-pilot Ken Reece 2,582 hours, Hammerschmidt said, adding both "were reported to be very good pilots."
Both engines of the plane showed they were rotating and working on impact and all eight power blades showed damage consistent with fact they were rotating on impact.
Some observers had suggested the crash could have been caused by broken propeller blades. Propeller problems have been blamed for two previous fatal crashes involving the Brasilia model.
the Monroe county medical examiner said there were still remains to be removed and that the identification process was expected to begin on Saturday.

Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday that its profit jumped 82 percent to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as it rebounded from product launches that held profits down a year earlier.
Ford, the last of the Big Three Detroit automakers to report fourth-quarter results, said it earned $1 a share. The results included a $132 million charge for one-time items.
A year earlier, Ford earned $660 million, or 49 cents a share. For all of 1996, Ford's net income rose 7 percent to $4.45 billion, or $3.64 a share.
Fourth-quarter revenues were $38.8 billion vs. $34.6 billion. Revenues for the year climbed to $147.0 billion from $137.1 billion in 1995.
"We have successfully completed our highest-volume launches in North America and Europe," Ford Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Trotman said in a statement.
"We're starting 1997 in a much stronger competitive position," he said. "We expect automotive earnings to improve in 1997."
Ford's core U.S. automotive operations, which contribute about 65 percent of total automotive revenues, reported profit of $628 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $168 million a year ago.
Ford continues to benefit from strong sales of F-Series pickup trucks, Explorer sport/utility vehicles, and its new Expedition full-size sport/utility.
About 55 percent of Ford's U.S. automotive sales in 1996 were light truck products, the segment that includes pickups, minivans and sport/utilities.
But Ford continued to have problems overseas. The company's non-U.S. automotive operations lost $238 million in the quarter, up from a loss of $152 million, due primarily to losses in Europe and South America.
Ford's European loss for the quarter rose to $88 million from $48 million a year ago. But it was less than the $472 million it lost in the third quarter.
In South America, where Ford has struggled in the Brazilian market, the fourth quarter loss was $287 million, compared with $112 million a year ago.
Trotman said Ford expects better results for all of 1997 in Europe, where the company has launched several cost-cutting moves.
He also predicted improving results for Brazil and Argentina and said Ford is expecting smaller losses in South America for all of 1997, and is targeted to break even in 1998.
"We have the right plans in Brazil and Argentina to restore our strength and profitabilty, although we know it will take some time as we introduce new products, build a new organization and restore the dealer body," he said. "Overall, we are on track."
Ford's stock lost 25 cents to $32.25 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

General Motors Corp. said Tuesday its fourth quarter earnings fell by more than half as labour strife slashed production and took a $700 million bite out of profits.
The world's largest automaker earned $786 million, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $1.6 billion, or $1.95 a share, in the 1995 fourth quarter. All figures exclude results from Electronic Data Systems Corp., which was spun off last June.
GM's fourth quarter revenues fell to $40.95 billion from $41.35 billion.
For all of 1996, GM earned $4.95 billion, or $6.06 a share, down from $6.03 billion, or $7.14 a share. Revenues for the year rose to $164.1 billion from $160.3 billion.
U.S. and Canadian auto workers struck GM plants in October and November, while a United Auto Workers strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants crippled GM's North American production for more than two weeks.
The strikes cut GM's full-year earnings by $1.2 billion and were largely responsible for a fourth quarter loss of $124 million in GM's core North American automotive operations. A year earlier, GM earned $603 million in North America.
"Clearly our 1996 fourth-quarter and calendar-year results were impacted by the strike-related production losses in the United States and Canada and are not indicative of GM's potential for continued profit improvement," GM Chairman John Smith said.
Smith also blamed GM's disappointing 1996 results on factory changeovers for new models and higher expenses for incentives and advertising.
GM's fourth quarter also included several extraordinary items that brought down earnings by $762 million, or 99 cents a share, including the $700 million in strike costs, a $157 million loss on the sale of four parts plants a $167 million charge related to GM's new UAW contract.
In addition, the fourth quarter also included a separate, favourable tax gain of $262 million.
The strikes also ate into 1996 profit-sharing checks for GM's union workers. GM said U.S. 282,000 represented workers in the United States will receive about $300 each -- less than half of the $800 they recived last year and a pittance of the $7,900 that Chrysler Corp. workers will get this year.
GM said 76,000 eligible salaried workers also will receive 1996 profit-sharing checks based on their level of pay and responsibility.
GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh promised that the 15 new car and truck models that GM is now introducing would bring long-awaited gains in North American market share and profitability in 1997.
GM's U.S. car and truck market share fell to 31 percent in 1996 from 32.4 in 1995.
"As we look forward to 1997, GM will get the bulk of its improvements here in North America, and we do expect to improve year-to-year," Losh told reporters.
The automaker will need the gains to offset a worsening picture in its international operations. GM officials told analysts not to expect increases in international profits for 1997 because of the slumping car market in Europe and spending for new plants in Poland, Argentina, Thailand and China.
GM's fourth quarter international profits fell to $353 million from $498 million a year ago. For the 1996 full year, they fell to $1.5 billion from $1.6 billion in 1995.
In Europe, GM's fourth quarter profits fell 60 percent to $99 million as retail incentive soared to $580 per car from $326 a year earlier.
GM's worldwide wholesale vehicle sales fell 7.1 percent to 1.99 million cars and trucks, with North American shipments off 11.4 percent and international shipments up 0.5 percent.
Analysts said the results were disappointing, but contained a few bright spots, including an increase in GM's year-end cash reserve to $17 billion from $10.2 billion at the end of 1995 and $14.5 billion on September 30, 1996.
"It's a good news, bad news quarter," said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. "It suggests that if 1997 is normal and largely free of strikes, it ought to be another good year for cash generation."
Cash beyond GM's $13 billion reserve goal may be used to boost stock repurchases, analysts said. Losh said GM wanted to move quickly on the $2.5 billion buyback plan announced Monday. GM stock closed down $1.125 at $60.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Federal investigators said on Sunday an examination of engine wreckage from the Delta Comair crash showed the crew tried to shut off the right engine and activate a fire extinguisher system.
Although the pilots took three steps to cut the engine, investigators said they had found no indication there was a fire on the plane when it slammed into a snowy field in rural south-east Michigan late on Thursday afternoon.
"There is no indication of an in-flight fire," National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) official John Hammerschmidt told reporters at a briefing.
Hammerschmidt said the cockpit voice recorder showed the pilot began a 30-degree banking turn to the left and after three seconds of a stable turn the angle increased.
"Over the next eight-second period of time, the angle of bank increased to approximately 40 degrees. At that point the aircraft departed controlled flight. All data ended approximately 17 seconds after it departed controlled flight," he added.
Hammerschmidt, and the lead NTSB investigator on the scene Richard Rodriguez, did not offer an explanation for the plane's left turn and apparent right engine problems.
Hammerschmidt said that on Monday investigators would begin decontaminating the wreckage and moving it to a building at the local fairgounds where it would be subject to further examination. NTSB officials said they expected to wrap up most on-site work by the end of the week.
Also on Monday investigators in Washington D.C. will resume their study of the "black box" cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder that were recovered from the wreckage of the Brasilia aircraft, built by Embraer of Brazil.
A local church held a packed memorial service on Sunday attended by relatives of the victims, some of whom visited the scene where a simple memorial had been made from bales of hay.
A blue and white sign perched on a hay bale said, "In memory of the passengers and crew of Comair Flight 3272, from the community of Monroe County and southeast Michigan."
Investigators braved below-zero windchills for the third day in a row on Sunday, retreiving body parts and continuing their probe into the crash, which occurred as the plane was on approach to Detroit Metropolitan Airport from Cincinnati.
Monroe County Medical Examiner David Lieberman said work crews were making good progress in identifying the remains of the 26 passengers and three crew members killed when the plane nosedived to the ground from about 4,000 feet (1,200 metres).

The Czech Republic has recorded its first budget deficit despite last ditch efforts by the government, which has staked its reputation on fiscal responsibility, to achieve a fourth consecutive surplus.
The Finance Ministry said on Friday that definitive data showed the budget ending 1996 with a deficit of 1.56 billion Czech crowns ($57.28 million).
Modest though the budget may be by Western standards, it was the first shortfall since the Czech Republic became a sovereign nation in 1993 following the demise of Czechoslovakia.
The centre-right government made a final effort to balance the books in December when the budget seemed to be heading for a deficit of more than five billion crowns.
It postponed some spending until 1997, and required early repayment of credit granted to a deposit insurance fund.
Finance Ministry spokeswoman Ludmila Nutilova said revenues for 1996 totalled 482.8 billion crowns, while expenditures were 484.3 billion.
Ministry officials have said the deficit might edge up even further since more bills might be delivered after the deadline.
The budget has been hampered continually by lower than expected tax revenue and delayed repayment of credits to Russia.
The original 1996 budget was balanced with spending and revenue at 497.6 billion crowns, but an autumn round of cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns.
Parliamentary budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner, a member of the opposition Social Democrats, said the 1996 deficit was not troublesome. But he was concerned about the effects that government payment adjustments might have on the 1997 budget.
Part of the December stop-gap measures included postponing payment of 800 million crowns in state subsidies for housing loans which had been due to the partially-privatised banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the "alpha and omega" of his government, hailed initial reports of a 1996 budget surplus made by the finance ministry soon after the New Year, as a sign of continued fiscal responsibility.
Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.
But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996.
Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep a much larger deficit at bay.

A wave of high-yielding Czech crown Eurobonds that has flooded the debt market since the beginning of the year has begun to ebb, as interest rates ease and arbitrage opportunities decline, analysts said on Tuesday.
"The Euro-madness is definitely over. We may see a couple more issues but those will be mainly by issuers who are active in the Czech Republic," Ota Otepka, chief bond trader at ING Barings, told Reuters.
Since the start of the year, issuers have rushed to take advantage of a stable, strong currency and interest rates above 11 percent, flooding the market with nearly 30 billion crowns ($1.1 billion) worth of Eurobonds in just over four weeks.
Dealers said that with interest rates so high, and a crown that is 65 percent linked to the mark but yielding seven to eight percentage points above it, the appetite for crown Eurobonds had appeared insatiable.
But interest rates have eased some 60-70 basis points since the start of the year and yields have dropped, spoiling the appetite for many investors.
"Maybe lead managers were overly optimistic about the potential placing capabilities and appetite of foreign investors," said Jan Pudil of WoodCommerz.
"Of course this hunger has been filled quite substantially. At this stage we are at the level where these investors are now satisfied," he added.
More than 20 bond issues were launched in crowns by a host of top-rated, retail-friendly names, lured by its reputation as one of Europe's most stable currencies.
German media group Bertelsmann AG launched on Tuesday a one billion crown one-year bond with a 10.5 percent coupon, but the rate of issuance has slowed.
Analysts estimate about 90 percent of the crown bonds were bought by retail investors from Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland.
Investors saw a great chance of picking up high-yield, low-risk paper but issuers and managers were presented with an easy arbitrage opportunity since rates were so high.
But Pudil said that issuers, once awash in opportunities for currency swaps, were now hard pressed to find advantageous rates allowing many to place bonds with coupons above 10 percent, a psychological minimum level.
"You have a three-year swap now at 10.25 percent and if you were to bring a cross-currency swapped three-year Eurobond, you get a coupon below 10 percent and you can't sell something to west European retail investors at below 10 percent," he said.
Another trader added: "A lot of the issues were swap driven, but swap prices have fallen below the Eurobond yields and this has stopped the arbitrage possibility."
"We also may see declining interest in buying Czech Eurobonds because the crown is so strong that its security is declining," he added.
The crown was fixed at a record high against its dollar/mark basket on Tuesday at 5.51 percent above the parity midpoint, some three percentage points higher than at the beginning of the year.
Traders added that two and three-year bonds are almost impossible to launch now, given the lack of arbitrage options. Most issuers had preferred short-dated bonds anyway due to an inverted yield curve which meant higher coupons are available at shorter maturities.

The Czech Republic recorded its first budget deficit, despite last ditch efforts by its fiscally-hawkish government to achieve its fourth consecutive surplus.
The government a final effort in December when the budget looked headed for a more than five billion crown deficit, by freezing some outlays until 1997, and requiring early repayment on credit granted to a deposit insurance fund.
But the measures were not enough and the Finance Ministry announced on Friday that definitive results show the budget ending 1996 with a deficit of 1.562 billion crowns.

The Prague Stock Exchange slipped on Monday from last week's year high on a round of profit taking, but analysts said sentiment remains bullish for the coming weeks.
After a strong rise last week, market heavyweights SPT Telecom, CEZ and Komercni Banka, which together account for almost half of the PX50 index, all fell to drag the index down 0.77 percent to 595.1 points.
"The market has corrected a little bit, but there seems to be good support at this level," Marco Anderegg of Patria Finance told Reuters.
"Foreign investor interest remains solid and towards the end of last week broader issues were gaining interest so it looks solid for a lot of the market," he added.
SPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, closed down 75 crowns at 3,700, while power company CEZ, which accounts for 14 percent, was off 28 crowns to 1,202 and commercial bank Komercni (11 percent) lost 25 crowns to 2,620.
"We saw some of the blue chips such as Komercni and SPT rebound in late deals, which could show that the market's weakness will be short-lived. I expect to see prices begin rising again soon," said one local trader.
The PSE has been climbing steadily since a slump in the fourth quarter 1996 took 25 percent off the index. Analysts blamed a lack of government commitment to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency for the dive.
The index has gained nearly 10 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors.
Bram Buring of Brno Broker Group said the correction could last for several weeks as lower than expected company results began to flood in, possibly taking as much as five percent from the index before it rebounds.
But he added: "Foreign investors are definitely interested and kick starting the market...We expect that to continue but things have overheated a little at the moment."
Analysts added that the recent strong performance of the crown should also boost the equities market since investors are shielded from wide currency fluctuations.
The crown has gained over three percent against its dollar/mark basket since the beginning of the year, and analysts have predicted it will hold its value or strengthen further in the coming weeks.
In late afternoon trading on Monday it was holding steady at 5.32 percent above its basket mid-point, up slightly from the central bank's daily fixing at 5.28 percent over the mid-point. The crown was fixed on Friday at 5.23 percent above the mid-point.

The United States on Tuesday raised the stakes in a battle to supply NATO aspirants in central Europe with advanced fighter aircraft by offering the Czechs free use of seven Navy Hornet aircraft for five years.
Representatives of the U.S. Navy on behalf of the U.S. government offered to lease the Czech Republic seven McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 "Hornet" fighter planes under a no-cost, five-year agreement, McDonnell Douglas said in a statement.
"The offer (to the Czech government) is for the no-cost, five-year leasing of six single-seat F/A-18A and one two-seat F/A-18B aircraft," said the statement, issued by the Prague representative of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
The offer included the supply, at cost, of replacement parts, pilot and ground personnel training programmes and support equipment.
Also competing for post-Cold War business in central Europe are U.S. Lockheed Martin, which makes F-16's primarily for the U.S. airforce, the Anglo-Swedish consortium of SAAB and British Aerospace, which makes the "Gripen", and France's Dassault Aviation makers of the "Mirage".
The Czech government, seeking to prepare for eventual membership in NATO, has been debating decisions on buying any aircraft as proposed cuts in defence spending have clouded the debate over the upgrading of the fleet.
The Czechs, along with Poland and Hungary, are seen as leading candidates for early NATO membership, when the western security alliance expands.
Czech defence officials have said they have the will but not the wallet to buy brand new western-made advanced fighters, but are keeping their options open as a battle over the long-term military budget goes on.
They have said they would need about 24 fighters to replace their ageing Soviet made MiG-21s to be more compatible with NATO, but at more than $20 million per fighter, new western planes are too pricey.
It was not yet clear whether the aircraft in the U.S. offer would be used or new, and the Prague spokesman for McDonnell Douglas was not immediately available for further comment.
"Supply and service costs will be the subject of further discussions," the statement said.
Czech pilots could begin training in the planes in six months, with delivery of the aircraft 18 months after the contract is signed, the statement said.
To strengthen its bid, McDonnell Douglas also said that it is preparing to locate production of components for the Hornet at Czech light jet maker Aero Vodochody a.s. "regardless of whether new or leased aircraft are chosen to re-equip the Czech Air Force".
Cooperation could also include Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s., it added.

The Prague Stock Exchange continued to gain ground on Thursday, but analysts said they were not convinced the beleaguered bourse's fortunes had turned around, attributing the rise to thin domestic buying.
The bourse has showed signs of rebounding recently -- gaining in 15 of the past 16 sessions. But analysts saw little change in market sentiment amid mostly domestic trading as investment funds settled positions before the end of the year.
"This doesn't really look like a rebound to me. (Mainly) there's a bit of domestic buying and some of the local brokers are just bidding up the market," Alex Angell of the brokerage Wood and Company said.
The PX50 index closed up 0.56 percent at 521.1 at its daily price fixing on Thursday, putting the bourse about nine percent higher than its low in mid-November.
The PSE stumbled through most of the autumn, losing close to 20 percent as key investors sold positions, tired of a market characterised as unregulated and murky.
Although eastern Europe's most-capitalised bourse, the Czech market has long been plagued by poor legislation that investors say fails to provide protection for minority shareholders.
Under the Czech Republic's Securities Act, devised to handle the logistics of the government's massive voucher privatisation scheme, the Securities Registry (SCP) is bound by law to provide services such as moving securities to and from client accounts.
Since the SCP does not reveal any details of transactions, including prices and volumes, local brokers have taken to the SCP because of its privacy and faster settlement process.
But this has restrained activity on the PSE which sees on average $4-6 million of stock turnover each day, compared with $15 million in Warsaw, a much smaller market.
"There are clearly investors who have decided to stay away from this market because of its opaqueness and are still on the sidelines," said one international trader.
"This is the case especially at the end of the year when a lot of local funds push prices all over the place in order to get a desired result on their books for the year," he added.
But many analysts said that hope is not lost for the bourse.
They expected investors to buy back into the market as the downtrend bottoms out, although maybe not before the end of the year.
"I expect most of the buying to come in the New Year, but I think it means that investors already familiar with the market should do something now," said Danial Gladis, head of the brokerage Atlantik Financni Trhy.
Market officials have also begun taking steps to correct the problems which should slowly lure back disenchanted investors.
In April, parliament approved a series of market reforms to compel companies and fund managers to be more open and accountable. A key element tackles the chronic problem of slow and irregular reporting of company earnings and actions.
The PSE itself has taken several steps to brings more transparency to the market, stressing in particular the need for the early creation of an independent watchdog, though analysts said a lack of political will to establish the body remains.

Markets across Eastern Europe remained mired in an autumn slump this week, with analysts seeing little on the horizon to break the bearish trend.
Stock Exchanges in Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest, Zagreb and Ljubljana all lost ground on the week. Budapest bucked the trend, rising slightly, although it appeared to lose steam by the end of the week.
PRAGUE
Not even a strong showing by the centre-right governing coalition in Senate elections at the weekend could break the Prague Stock Exchange out of its current slump, as the PX50 index dipped 0.8 points on the week to close on Thursday at 509.3.
Analysts said that while the coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus may feel heartened by the showing which gave him a majority to the Czech upper house, which will have little power, investors remain put off by poor market regulation.
"I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring changes to the market," said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka.
"I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic."
Investors have long complained that market regulation and legislation in the Czech Republic is weak, providing little protection for minority shareholders.
WARSAW
The Warsaw Stock Exchange stayed virtually flat this week and analysts were divided over the market's direction.
Some said the bourse could extend its three-week sideways trend as no fresh signals were in sight. "We are still in a horizontal trend and...I see no factors which could help create a clear direction for the market," said Mateusz Andrzejewski, an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage.
Others saw the generally positive economic climate as a strong enough impulse that it could help the bourse climb above 14,000 points next week.
Analysts said a senior central bank official's comment on Tuesday about a possible rise in interest rates next year was bringing some uncertainty to the bourse but was unlikely to signficantly hurt prices.
BUDAPEST
Hungarian shares started off the weekend strongly, boosted by a government decision to hike energy prices, but they ran out of steam by the middle of the week.
Oil and gas company MOL led the charge, but dealers said its weakening on Thursday could be a harbinger.
"MOL turned around today (on Thursday), that is a warning sign," said New York Broker's Kalman Schuszter. "Sellers are stronger now." The BUX index closed on Thursday at 3,674.61, up 3.1 percent from Monday's open.
BRATISLAVA
Slovak share prices continued their freefall on the Bratislava Stock Exchange which has lost about 25 percent since the end of August.
The 12-share SAX index fell 12.49 points on the week to close at 161.82 on Thursday.
Dealers said the silver lining to the bourse's woes may be that prices are becoming so cheap that foreign investors will soon be lured back.
BUCHAREST
Scant demand kept volumes modest at both weekly sessions in Bucharest, with turnover low and most prices edging down or staying flat.
The unofficial VAB index inched down from the previous session by 1.1 percent to 294.2 points, while the BIG index eased 1.07 percent to 293.41.
Fertiliser maker Azomures SA dominated trading, while newcomer, an oilfield equipment maker, put on a poor show.
ZAGREB
Croatian stocks were mostly lower in dwindling trade and analysts said they could see no end to the bearish period as big buyers continue to shy away from the market because of political developments.
Croatia has been shaken by a wave of strikes, and last week Zagreb saw its biggest protest in years.
LJUBLJANA
Political concerns were also apparent in Ljubljana this week, with investors waiting for a new prime minister to be named, probably in the second half of December.
"The market will be uneasy until it is clear who will form the new government," one trader said. The SBI index fell 6,7 points from Monday's open to close on Thursday at 1,145.5.
Although the Liberal Democrats of current Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek were the strongest single party in the general election, winning 25 out of 90 parliamentary seats, they are facing a loose alliance of rightist "Spring" parties, who got 45 seats.

The Prague Stock Exchange, boosted by strong blue chip gains, hit a year-high on Thursday, but analysts said any strong bullish sentiment was tempered by a lack of liquidity and low foreign investor interest.
At the heart of the bourse's rise has been a resurgence of the market's two most-capitalised issues -- SPT Telecom and CEZ -- which account for over one-third of the PX50 index.
Both hits 52-week highs at the daily price fixing on Thursday to push the index 1.1 percent higher to 586.5, but analysts cautioned that the market was still plagued by a lack of liquidity, which was distorting price movements.
"Volumes are very thin, when you come to the market looking for a bigger parcel of shares it doesn't take much interest to move the prices. But the truth is, not a lot of foreign money is flowing in," said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company.
SPT Telecom shares, which account for 20 percent of the PSE's market capitalisation, jumped 85 crowns to 3,660, while CEZ, which account for 14 percent, rose 34 crowns to 1,193.
Dealers said they did not see any fundamental reasons for SPT shares to rise much further, but that CEZ could climb another two or three percent.
The PSE has recently showed signs of life after a fourth quarter 1996 slump took 25 percent off the index after a lack of commitment on the part of government officials to strengthen minority shareholder rights and increase market transparency undermined the market.
The index has gained a modest 8.7 percent so far in 1997, and a new commitment from Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and bourse officials to clean up the market is slowly luring back many disgruntled foreign investors.
Though it may not be a panacea to the market woes, most analysts agree that the oversight commission could be the most important step the PSE could take in 1997.
"Foreign investors have definitely been heartened by official movement on cleaning up the market," said one foreign broker.
"The market will probably edge up slightly with such low liquidity. Hopefully when 1996 earnings begin to come in the bourse will have a new impetus," he added. Company results are expected to begin flowing in at the beginning of March.
Factors outside the bourse floor are also contributing to the market's rise.
Radek Vavra of Citicorp Securities in Prague said that given the current strength of the currency, the crown, and several other technical factors, the market should continue firming.
He added that he was seeing strong foreign investor interest, giving the rally potential "to continue over the next week before it levels off in two to three weeks".
The crown has gained some three percent against its dollar/mark basket since the beginning of the year, and analysts have predicted it will hold its value or strengthen further in the coming weeks.
At midday on Thursday it was trading at 5.16 percent above its basket mid-point, upslightly from the central bank's daily fixing at +5.12 percent.

The Czech December trade deficit should rise to 16 billion crowns from 14.3 billion in the last month of 1995, ending the worst Czech trading year on another sour note, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Friday.
Czech 1996 trade figures are to be released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Monday.
Most economists surveyed said they expect steady growth in the deficit but few surprises.
"I expect that the figures will be in-line with the development throughout 1996," Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance told Reuters.
Whatever the December deficit, the full-year trade gap is guaranteed to be a record given that the January-November figure reached 140.1 billion crowns, already far beyond 1995's record total shortfall of 95.7 billion crowns.
Most analysts agreed a 15-17 billion crown December gap, after a 16.6 billion crown shortfall in November, would match prevailing trends and the concensus forecast of a 1996 deficit of 155-165 billion crowns.
The foreign exchange and money markets are expected to show little reaction over the figures -- as the worsening Czech trade balance has been long built into crown rates -- as long as the results do not vary greatly from the estimates.
Analysts say the trade balance has been hurt by a downturn in western European economies. Effects of a recovery in demand have yet to make an impact on Czech exports.
CSU figures consistently show the rate of import growth exceeding export growth, though the gap has narrowed in recent months.
Czech exporters told the CSU in a survey released earlier this month that, among other suggestions, they would want a 20 to 25 percent devalution of the crown against a mark/dollar basket to help boost lagging exports in 1997.
In comments to the CSU survey, the exporters said that if there would not be a devaluation of the still strong Czech currency, then they expect the governmnet to adopt administrative measures such as higher tariffs and surcharges to regulate imports.
The government and central bank, however, have repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to boost exports.
Analysts point to mid-1997 as a crucial time in which the import wave -- which is aimed at modernising industries -- must show results in productivity growth and competitiveness.
"There are concerns of the effect this has on the current account deficit," said one London-based economist.
"There is a question of the sustainability of the current account deficit. If you have a significantly higher figure than 15 or 16 billion crowns for December, I think people will get a little bit edgy," he added.
The current account stood at a deficit of $3.1 billion for the first three quarters of the year, in the latest available figures, spurred by the spiralling trade deficit which stood at the time at $4.1 billion.
Economists have said the current account deficit for 1996, forecast at roughly seven percent of gross domestic product, could be financed in the short to medium term through the capital account surplus and strong central bank reserves.
However, the deficit might start putting pressure on reserves in the second half of 1997.

Czech consumer inflation continued its gradual downtrend in January, but analysts said they do not expect a loosening of the central bank's tight monetary policy in the short-term.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday said January inflation, month-on-month, was 1.2 percent, putting the year-on-year rate at 7.4 percent, down from 8.6 percent the previous month.
The key sliding average inflation figure, which uses 1993 as a base, edged down to 8.7 percent from 8.8 percent in December, and was down from 9.1 percent in January 1996.
"The January number is very good, about one percentage point lower than a year ago," Kamil Janacek, cheif economist at Komercni Banka told Reuters.
"If prices and some deregulations develop accoridng to plan in the next months, and thanks to producer prices being under five percent...there is a high probability that 1997 inflation could end at around, or just under, eight percent," he added.
The CSU said in a report that the biggest influences on the January inflation rate were food, drinks and tobacco products which rose 1.3 percent in the month, transportation which rose 3.6 percent and housing which rose by 1.3 percent.
It added that of the 1.2 percent month-on-month rate, seasonal influences accounted for 0.23 percent, putting the seasonally-adjusted monthly rate at 0.97 percent.
CSU figures show price deregulation influenced the seasonally-adjusted rate by 0.63 percent, while seasonally-adjusted core inflation was 0.34 percent.
Despite the downtrend, most analysts agreed that there seems little chance the Czech National Bank (CNB), the central bank, will ease its tight monetary policy in the near future despite the sustained downtrend in CPI.
Curbing inflation has been at the heart of almost all of the CNB's policies, and both CNB and government officials have said they expect rates to remain high, at least over the near term.
"The month-on-month rate appears favourable," Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings, said.
"While there may be some room for it, I doubt the central bank will lower rates immediately -- maybe in the second quarter at the earliest," he added.
Last summer the CNB raised its key discount rate one percentage point to 10.5 percent, and hiked minimum reserve requirements to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent of deposits to squeeze off surging domestic demand.
The moves have appeared to signficantly slow growth in the money supply, which is now at the lower end of the central bank's 13 to 17 percent growth target.
But central bank officials have warned that wage growth -- which was up 21.2 percent in nominal terms in December according to preliminary figures -- and its influence on inflation is a growing concern.
"The government has to somehow limit wage growth. It's just too high and this must be addressed before the central bank will move rates," said one London-based economist.
Foreign exchange traders said the crown was unaffected by January's CPI figures since they were in line with forecasts.
The crown was fixed by the central bank on Monday at 5.28 percent above its dollar/mark basket midpoint, slightly stronger than its +5.14 percent fixing from last Friday.

China and Hong Kong headed for a showdown on Tuesday as the leader of Hong Kong's democrats said he would fight in court Beijing's plan to ram through laws against civil rights before this year's sovereignty change.
A new row was also brewing between London and Beijing after Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen called for a rewrite of textbooks in Hong Kong schools to conform with China's principles and history.
Hong Kong was prised from China by Britain in the 19th century opium wars and reverts to Beijing on July 1.
Pro-China politician Chung Sze-yuen, mentor and adviser to Hong Kong's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, told reporters late on Monday the China-appointed shadow legislature could pass laws before midnight on June 30.
The legislature will replace Hong Kong's elected chamber after the handover.
Other pro-China politicians promptly contradicted earlier remarks and said the legislature should adopt "vital laws" before the sovereignty transfer, including the budget law and those reducing civil liberties.
Martin Lee, chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party said on Tuesday his party would immediately take the handover legislature to court if it went ahead and made laws.
"We will act according to the provisional legislature's decision," Lee told reporters.
"One way is for somebody to go to the court as soon as they have begun to purport to legislate," Lee said.
Britain, the pro-democracy camp and major law organisations oppose the provisional body as an institution designed to snuff out democracy. They say Hong Kong's constitution allows only one legislature, the current Legislative Council, to operate.
Lee and fellow lawyers argue it would be illegal if the provisional body passes laws, holds meetings or opens offices in Hong Kong before July 1. So far, it has only met in China.
An influential independent Hong Kong business newspaper also warned the provisional legislature was about to set a dangerous example.
The Economic Journal said on Tuesday the body was about to "set the precedent of making law without upholding to the law, with a great effect on the future reputation of Hong Kong".
It said minister Qian had broken a promise he made last April that the body would pass no laws before the handover.
The leader of Hong Kong's biggest pro-China party, Tsang Yok-sing, said China's parliament had now given the green light for the shadow legislature to pass laws before handover, but he said it should use this power sparingly.
"The provisional legislature must be able to do so but it will only use the power when it is absolutely necessary. It will pass bills before July 1 if it is necessary," Tsang said.
Colonial governor Chris Patten lashed out on Monday at China after Qian said in Beijing that schoolbooks should be revised.
Patten said the proposal was out of line with the treaty on Hong Kong's handover and its post-colonial constitution, the Sino-British Declaration and the Basic law.
"The Joint Declaration and the Basic Law guarantee Hong Kong's autonomy in educational matters after 1997," he said.
"They are clear that educational policies are to be set by the (Hong Kong government), and not to be vetted for political correctness by Chinese officials," Patten said.
Qian had said Hong Kong schoolbooks did not conform with the "one country two systems" policy for reunifying China.
"The contents of some textbooks currently used in Hong Kong do not accord with history or reality, are not suited to the changes after 1997...and must be revised," Qian said.
Patten countered: "Naturally, schoolchildren need to be taught after 1997 about their new sovereign power... This has already begun... But if Mr Qian is suggesting more than this, his statement raises some disturbing questions."

Britain and China moved ahead on Wednesday to resolve outstanding details of Beijing's recovery of sovereignty over Hong Kong this year.
Just a day after they had agreed on a budget to straddle the handover, the two sides announced a breakthrough allowing Hong Kong a free hand to organise media coverage of the historic event on June 30 without China's interference.
And Britain's chief diplomatic negotiator said he thought there would soon be an agreement on one of the last burning issues -- the right of abode in the territory.
The latest progress comes just four months before Britain ends a century and a half of colonial rule and hands the territory of 6.4 million people back to communist-ruled China.
But a possible political bombshell lurked in the background as a prominent pro-democracy legislator prepared to ask the government to press China on the role of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong after the change of flag.
On the media accord in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), Britain's negotiator Hugh Davies said: "We very much look forward to as many as possible of the international press, the local press being interested in participating and recording and reporting on the handover ceremony."
Human rights and democracy activists had voiced fears that China would not consent to a media invasion without the right to vet which journalists come to the event.
"The two sides have agreed to entrust the Hong Kong government to receive and process applications from journalists, as well as handle and arrange other matters relating to media coverage of the handover ceremony," the two sides said.
"There will be no criteria applied...provided you don't turn out to be a terrorist," Davies told reporters.
It was the second positive turn in the JLG talks in as many days. On Tuesday Britain and China struck a deal on Hong Kong's 1997/98 fiscal year, starting April 1 and covering the handover year. Finance Secretary Donald Tsang will read the budget to the legislature on March 12.
"We are convinced it will be welcomed by society," said Chinese representative Chen Zuo'er, adding that the budget would stick to Hong Kong's "prudent and moderate" tradition.
Davies said after that deal that he was hopeful a deal could soon be done on right of abode, covering who would have residence rights in Hong Kong and on what terms.
"I hope major progress can be made on those matters which are not yet resolved," his Chinese counterpart Zhao Juhua said. The two sides also still have to work out an agreement on details of the People's Liberation Army garrison that China plans to install in Hong Kong, as well as a guest list for the handover ceremony, and a string of air services agreements.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's post-colonial leader-to-be Tung Chee-hwa saw his fortunes climb in the opinion polls as the latest survey showed more than three quarters of people felt confident he would do a good job as Hong Kong's Chief Executive.
But Tung remained under pressure from Hong Kong critics and foreign governments concerned about his support for Beijing's plan to roll back democratic freedoms in the territory.
The United States, European parliament members, as well as newsaper editorial writer, have urged Tung and China this week to realise that political and economic freedoms go hand in hand, and that a cut in basic rights could hurt the economy.
A group called the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature, on Wednesday condemned the opening of a liaison office for the shadow legislature that China plans to install on July 1, dissolving the present elected Legislative Council. It urged the Hong Kong government to seek a court injunction against the move.

A page of history is set to turn when Chinese troops enter Hong Kong on Monday to prepare for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) after Britain marches out of the territory in July.
The 40-strong advance party led by Major-General Zhou Borong will arrive in the colony on British Queen Elizabeth's birthday. They will drive into Hong Kong from China's Shenzhen region in full uniform but unarmed.
The PLA advance guard will be the first Chinese troops ever to be stationed on Hong Kong island.
Eight PLA staff cars and trucks will enter at the Lok Ma Chau land crossing at around lunchtime (0500 GMT).
They will drive the 30 km (19 miles) to the Prince of Wales Barracks in downtown Hong Kong, arriving soon after British troops fire a 21-gun salute marking the Queen's birthday.
The advance party will be the first of up to 10,000 PLA troops who will form the Hong Kong garrison after Britain returns its last Asian colony -- a bustling capitalist outpost of 6.4 million people -- to Communist-ruled China at midnight on June 30.
Up to 200 advance troops are expected to arrive before the handover. By that day, Britain will have phased out its garrison forces, which were once 10,000-strong in the territory.
The last of the famed "Black Watch" highlanders regiment will depart just after the midnight flag change.
"This is an historic event," Edward Ho, a legislator of the relatively pro-China Liberal Party, told reporters.
But the anti-Communist Democratic Party, which received the largest number of votes in the 1995 elections, disagreed.
"This entry has little significance or excitement. The soldiers will keep a very low profile," said the party's security spokesman James To.
It will be the first quasi-sovereign presence China has been allowed in the transition towards handover.
Beijing is currently represented in Hong Kong by its Xinhua News Agency, by a diplomatic establishment known as the Joint Liaison Group, and by a large array of mainland companies.
British authorities said the PLA group will get no special treatment at the frontier. They will go through normal customs and immigration controls and then find their own way from the border to the Prince of Wales Barracks, where 28 of them will be billeted. Twelve will stay on nearby Stonecutters Island, where Britain recently closed its Tamar Naval base.
"The soldiers will be unarmed and are here to carry out practical preparations for the PLA to take over responsibility for the defence of Hong Kong on July 1," British armed forces spokesman Roger Goodwin told Reuters.
General Zhou will be greeted at the barracks by British garrison commander, Major-General Bryan Dutton.
"They will be greeted with normal courtesies, handshakes and salutes," Goodwin said.
"It is in the best long-term interests of the people of Hong Kong that there should be a smooth transfer of defence responsibilities to the PLA," he said.
"The British garrison looks forward to working with the advance party to help ensure a successful transfer. The future PLA garrison inherits a proud tradition from the British Hong Kong garrison, a success story which we will do everything to help them continue."
Many of Hong Kong's people are disturbed by the imminent arrival of an army whose tanks crushed the student-led democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
China has gone to pains in recent months to soothe those anxieties with a PLA campaign at their interim base over the border in Shenzhen, parading elite troops and stressing their qualities of virtue, discipline and high education.

China plans to abolish a raft of Hong Kong laws that allowed for democratic elections and shielded human rights in the British colony, which is set to revert to communist-ruled Beijing's control on July 1.
A legal panel of the China-controlled Preparatory Committee, meeting in Beijing, on Sunday decided to repeal or amend 25 laws and articles, some the product of recent reforms and others the outdated trappings of the colonial era.
Listing the planned changes, China's official Xinhua news agency said recent reforms in Hong Kong had been an attempt to apply British constitutional principles in violation of the 1984 Sino-British treaty and the 1990 Basic Law governing the territory's handover.
Pro-democracy groups and the colonial government described the Preparatory Committee's move as a blow to democracy and human rights that would dent international confidence in post-1997 Hong Kong.
"These recommendations are sadly predictable and a retrograde step which will deal a body blow to human rights protection in Hong Kong," a government spokesman said.
The territory, under the British flag for more than 150 years, is being handed back to China at midnight on June 30.
The handover treaty promises the territory of 6.3 million people a high degree of autonomy and allows it to retain its freewheeling capitalist system.
But China has long indicated it will dismantle the reforms of British Governor Chris Patten, who expanded democracy in Hong Kong against China's wishes after he took office in 1992.
Beijing has already appointed a provisional legislature to supplant the elected Legislative Council on July 1.
It is that new lawmaking body, which holds its first formal session this Saturday in the Chinese city of Shenzhen just over the border from Hong Kong, that will repeal the laws and introduce new ones.
Many in Hong Kong fear the new laws will be draconian and repressive. China says the changes are necessary because Britain has introduced laws in Hong Kong that clash with the territory's post-1997 mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
Among the laws to be scrapped or amended are Hong Kong's Bill of Rights, the 1992 election law and the Societies Ordinance under which political parties are allowed and the 1995 Public Order Ordinance which allows peaceful demonstrations.
Also to be rolled back are some colonial-era laws such as those regulating the British military, immigration, nationality status, extradition and colonial armorial bearings.
The changes largely echo proposals made two years ago by one of the early China-controlled panels that deliberated on the future political set-up, the Preparatory Working Committee.
The 150-member Preparatory Committee assembles mainland officials and pro-Beijing politicians from Hong Kong and reports to the Chinese central government.
The body, chaired by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, has mapped out the contours of the post-1997 Hong Kong regime.
It elected a Selection Commitee that last month appointed shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as the territory's post-colonial leader and the 60 members of the new legislature.

Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party on Thursday welcomed a pledge from the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, that people would keep their basic freedoms after China takes over on July 1.
But some activists staged a noisy protest disrupting a meeting staged by Tung's aides to tap the public's views on his controversial plan to whittle down civil liberties.
A new opinion poll, meanwhile, indicated nine in 10 of Hong Kong students do not believe China will really allow the territory its promised autonomy after Britain hands it back.
Fears have been rising in Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years and now with 6.4 million people, that the territory will suffer a loss of freedom after the handover.
Tung, set to become Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader, on Wednesday vigorously defended proposed curbs on the right to demonstrate and on foreign funding of political groups, saying laws in the United States were much tougher.
"The majority of cities in North America, including New York, Washington and San Francisco, all require police permission before demonstrations can be held," he said.
"Let me assure you the (future) government has the strongest determination to preserve the freedoms that the people of Hong Kong currently enjoy," Tung said in a dinner speech.
"Peaceful and lawful demonstrations can and must be allowed to continue. I see public demonstration as a way for people to express their views, and public demonstrations are now a part of Hong Kong culture," he said.
Anthony Cheung, vice president of the Democratic Party, which believes China would like to snuff out democracy in Hong Kong, cautiously welcomed Tung's assurances, the first public comment Tung has made on the proposals launched last week.
"We welcome this pledge that the right to protest, the right to demonstrate, the freedom of assembly and association, all of these are people's rights and should be part of Hong Kong's political culture," Cheung told Hong Kong radio.
"But we question a lot of the substance of Mr Tung's proposals on how to amend the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance," he said.
"Some of these proposals have in fact infringed the rights that Mr Tung was talking about."
About 16 pro-democracy councillors waved banners and shouted slogans, disrupting a public consultation on the plan at Hong Kong's Space Museum on Thursday. They then walked out of the meeting, attended by 50 members of local councils.
"We believe this is a fake consultation," said councillor Ng Wing-fai. "The members of the future government already have a basic line and the basic principles will not be changed."
Colonial Governor Chris Patten made clear on Wednesday that Britain would not back down on an issue at the heart of handover quarrels with China -- a shadow legislature that China has appointed to replace the current, elected Legislative Council.
Patten opposed calls to allow the China-appointed body to pass a law on residency rights before the hand-back to China.
"That is our position, our position is not going to change."
His comment followed a row this week after China announced rules on who would qualify for "right of abode" -- permanent residency -- in Hong Kong after the handover.
Beijing plans to submit the bill before June 30 to its Hong Kong provisional legislature.
The government said if the bill were to be handled before July 1 by the interim body it would be legally challenged.

Rights groups and academics warned of threats to freedom in Hong Kong on Tuesday, while a pro-China politician denied that proposed curbs to civil liberties would strangle the territory after Beijing takes over.
Hong Kong's 156 years under the British flag come to an end when the territory reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 and, with 63 days to go, the pace of political debate is quickening.
Human Rights Watch/Asia said changes to China's criminal code had made it easier for Beijing to stifle dissent, and Hong Kong people might even be put on trial in China.
A public consultation on the future of political freedom in the colony ends on Wednesday, and the bustling capitalist outpost's 6.4 million people are sharply divided.
The pulse-taking, launched by Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa, asks members of the public and organisations to submit views on his plan to ban foreign funding of political groups and curb the right to protest in the interests of "national security".
Hong Kong academics waded into the fray on Tuesday by saying the proposed rules on political groups posed a threat to freedom of association, the interpretation of foreign meddling was flawed and too much interpretation was left to authorities.
"This is tantamount to opening the door to abuse in the future," the statement, signed by 150 scholars, said.
Pro-democracy parties, the legal profession, human rights groups, Western-style trade unions and churches have objected to Tung's plan in written submissions, and there has been loud criticism from London and Washington.
But organisations representing industry, commerce, pro-China political parties and pro-Beijing trade unions support the plan, which was forced on Tung by a Chinese parliamentary resolution.
Pro-China politician Maria Tam told a business audience on Tuesday that Tung's proposal to curb civil and political liberties was not an attack on human rights.
"Tung Chee-hwa is not trying to strangle human rights here," Tam told the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in a speech.
Tam, a leading member of China's Preparatory Committee, which is charged with setting up the post-handover political system, said similar restrictions existed in the United States, Canada, Australia and other Western states.
In the latest twist, a powerful pro-Beijing labour group, the Federation of Trade Unions, called for a widening of definitions of political groups covered by the curbs.
But in an unusual move, the federation also called for a ban on funding from China's ruling Communist Party to local political groups to be added to the restrictions. The move would "avoid disputes and criticisms", union boss Cheng Yiu-tong said.
Pro-democracy trade union federation leader Lee Cheuk-yan attacked the bid to widen the net.
"(It) is a step backward, because they want to have more organisations defined as political groups," Lee told Reuters. "They want to pressure these organisations to depoliticise."
Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a report on Tuesday that China's striking of the term "counterrevolution" -- the communist code for subversion -- from the law books in March did not mean easing political controls. Quite the opposite.
"China has merely replaced the term 'counterrevolution' with the equally elastic notion of 'endangering state security' and has, in the process, actually broadened the capacity of the state to suppress dissent," the report said.
Hong Kong people, who China has vowed can keep their legal system and way of life for 50 years, could suffer, it said.
"Despite Hong Kong's separate legal system, Beijing may have the power to bring Hong Kong people to face trial in mainland courts," it said.

Hong Kong's future government has hit a new snag, with a shortage of trained staff forcing it to cancel a sitting of a controversial legislature preparing new laws ahead of the territory's handover to China.
It is the latest in a series of difficulties facing Tung Chee-hwa, the China-backed shipping magnate who will rule Hong Kong after the British pull out at midnight on June 30.
Tung's office said on Wednesday  thatthis Saturday's session of the provisional legislature, which had been scheduled to deal with a draft law on new flags, had been dropped from the diary. Just a briefing would take place.
"The draft bills aren't ready because there aren't enough people," Bob Howlett, a spokesman for Tung's office, told Reuters. He said Tung's coordinator, Michael Suen, concluded the office did not have enough draftsmen to prepare planned laws.
"He doesn't want to see a rushed job done on anything," Howlett said.
British Governor Chris Patten has refused to second more staff to the Tung office from the Hong Kong civil service to help the future government ready itself for the handover.
The office has only two law drafters on its staff.
Communist-ruled China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong, a British colony for the last 156 years, under a 1984 treaty that allows the territory virtual autonomy for another 50 years.
China, angered by democratic reforms introduced by Patten in the twilight years of British rule, set up the provisional legislature in December to replace the democratically elected Legislative Council (Legco).
Many of China's critics consider the interim body unconstitutional.
"I think it's a good thing there's now no legislation going forward this week, and it would be even better if no legislation goes forward at any time, because anything they do handle between now and June 30 is vulnerable to legal challenge after the first of July," said Patten's spokesman, Kerry McGlynn.
"That can't be in anybody's interests. We've always made it perfectly plain, and will continue to do so up to June 30, that we'll do nothing to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the current Legco by providing any kind of assistance to the provisional legislature," McGlynn told Reuters.
A spokesman for the provisional legislature said the body would now organise a briefing on Saturday on the planned civil rights curbs, instead of a full-fledged legislative session, at its base in the Chinese border town of Shenzhen.
Tung's run-up to his new job as Hong Kong chief executive has been a bumpy one.
Sino-British disputes were stoked this month after Tung launched a plan to curb political liberties such as the right to protest and the right of political groups to receive foreign funds. He provoked a domestic and international outcry.
Last week he admitted to the media that he had donated 50,000 stg ($81,500) to the ruling British Conservative Party in 1992, sparking cries of hypocrisy.
"They seem they can't get their act together," a government official said of the latest setback. "Tung's office is finding it nigh impossible to do the drafting, even though they still seem determined to go head with it.
"The Chinese side has painted itself into a corner with the provisional legislature. They've got themselves into a real pickle."

Chinese officials sent out positive signals about Beijing's future handling of Hong Kong on Friday, and diplomats indicated China and Britain had agreed on a VIP guestlist for a grand handover party.
Hong Kong reverts to communist-ruled China at midnight on June 30 after a century and a half as a British colony, and is to retain its separate capitalist system for 50 years.
Chinese officials attending a seminar on the transition sought to assure Hong Kong there will be no influx of mainland Chinese and that the future garrison will not misbehave.
They also tried to ease fears that the economy in the capitalist enclave of 6.4 million people will suffer and stressed the need to allow Hong Kong businessmen to travel.
Wang Fengchao, deputy head of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, dismissed fears that China would open the flood gates to migrants cashing in on Hong Kong's economic miracle.
He said there were strict rules on entry into Hong Kong, and children of illegal immigrants would not be allowed in. "These provisions...will have a deterrent effect," he said.
The general who guards the political purity of China's future Hong Kong garrison said the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would not meddle in local government or business affairs.
"The Hong Kong garrison and government will be independent military and administrative systems with no affiliate relationship and will not interfere with each other," said the garrison's political commissar, Major-General Xiong Zi Ren.
"I can categorically tell you that we resolutely will abide by all regulations set out in the law," Xiong said.
"We have already set a rule that bans involvement in production business," he said.
Tackling another issue worrying Hong Kong emigrants around the world, Wang announced a grace period for them to return to the territory if they want to keep permanent residency rights.
An estimated 750,000 of Hong Kong's 6.4 million people have foreign citizenship. The bulk have made Canada, Australia, Britain or the United States their adopted homes.
If they are abroad for long after July 1 they might lose their Hong Kong permanent residency.
Wang said China was prepared to allow them a grace period, but the length of time would be set by the post-handover Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
"As to the length of time they are allowed to stay outside Hong Kong, this is for the SAR to decide," he said.
Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the future cabinet of Hong Kong Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa, said he believed the period would be up to three years.
Britain, meanwhile, signaled it had agreed with China on the broad outlines of a guest list for the joint celebration of the handover to China three months from now.
A British official told Reuters the two sides would invite a total of about 3,200 guests to the event.
About 400 "international guests" would be included. Some would be government ministers and the heads of international organisations, said the official, who asked not to be named.
But China and Britain did not expect heads of government or heads of state. One diplomat said this was a sign China had won in its efforts not to give Britain too glorious a send-off.
Hong Kong's colonial Chief Secretary Anson Chan, who is keeping her job under Tung, said in Canada on Thursday China was fully committed to granting Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy.
"It is clear the Chinese leaders are fully committed to the faithful implementation of the late Deng Xiaoping's visionary concept of 'one country, two systems' and Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong," Chan said.
"There is a clear appreciation that only in this way can Hong Kong best serve the interests of China," she said.
However, the United States said on the same day that China had sent mixed and sometimes disturbing signals on the future of Hong Kong's legislature, human rights and press freedom after Beijing takes control on July 1.
"Over the past year, developments in Hong Kong have sent mixed signals about some aspects of the change in sovereignty," the State Department said in a report to Congress.
"There have been significant positive developments since March 1996," it said. But "China's actions regarding the future of the legislature and the laws governing human rights and civil liberties in Hong Kong have been disturbing and have caused concern in both Hong Kong and the international community."
China has set in motion plans to replace Hong Kong's elected legislature with an appointed body and to water down liberal laws protecting civil liberties and democracy.

Western countries are geared up to quietly grant asylum in the coming months to around 40 Chinese dissidents and their families who are living in exile in Hong Kong, human rights sources said on Tuesday.
The plan has been worked out by a number of countries which fear the dissidents may face persecution by Beijing's Communist rulers after China takes Hong Kong back from Britain on July 1, the sources said.
The fears of the exiles have grown over the past year as China unveiled plans to roll back democracy and human rights legislation introduced in Hong Kong under British rule and vowed not to allow "anti-constitutional" activities there.
Anxiety has been further stoked by China's renewed crackdown on dissenters, many of whom have been jailed over the past year.
"There is a general feeling of relief because they are going to be resettled. But they won't feel safe until they are on the plane," the source, a well-informed veteran human rights campaigner, told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Hundreds of Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists fled after army tanks thundered into Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989, crushing a student-led democracy movement.
Scores of the fugitives -- the exact number has not been officially made public -- found sanctuary in Hong Kong. A source from a dissident support group said there were between 100 and 200.
A source from a dissident support group, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, said word was circulating among activists that London had secretly promised dissidents they could settle in Britain if no other western country gave them sanctuary before the handover.
He said some dissident families had already been discreetly resettled in Western countries last year.
The territory has been a refuge since the late 19th century for Chinese dissenters and revolutionaries, who often exploited the shield provided by British colonial rule. These included the revolutionaries led by Sun Yat-sen, the founder of China's first republic, who plotted against China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing, and toppled it in 1911.
Many of the present dissidents-in-exile fled to Hong Kong along an elaborately organised secret escape route nicknamed "Operation Yellow Bird", with the help of Hong Kong activists and companies. To Beijing they are "wanted criminals".
Some were were whisked out in speed boats and others were smuggled into Hong Kong in ships or trucks, activists say.
The Hong Kong government has always declined to comment on asylum seekers out of fear of jeopardising their safety by drawing Beijing's attention to their whereabouts or of stirring up a quarrel, Western diplomats said.
The human rights source declined to name the countries involved in the 1997 rescue plan or when the dissident families would be leaving. "We don't know when they will leave. We don't know where they will be going," he said.
Western countries, wary about upsetting Beijing, have remained tightlipped in reaction to Hong Kong newspaper reports about a mass resettlement plan for the dissidents.
A well-known Chinese dissident in Hong Kong, labour activist and Tiananmen veteran Han Dongfang, told Reuters that Hong Kong would be unsafe for many dissidents after the handover.
"I cannot say 100 percent China is going to arrest them. But it is a concern," Han said. But he planned to stay regardless.
"I have to stay here to see what is going to happen," he said. "I may leave if things go wrong."

Kmart Corp. said Monday it may merge its Builders Square stores with Waban Inc.'s HomeBase business in a deal that would create the nation's third largest home improvement chain.
The deal, which reflects consolidation in the highly competitive home improvement retail niche, would also complete Kmart's exit from speciality retailing.
"What this will do is complete (Kmart's) strategy of divesting non-core businesses," Michael Conn, Gruntal &amp; Co. retail analyst, said.
Kmart said if a deal was completed, the Los Angeles-based investment group Leonard Green &amp; Partners L.P. would hold a majority interest in the new company. Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., and Waban, headquartered in Natick, Mass., would each retain minority interests.
The proposed new company would have about 250 stores in 25 states with annual revenues of nearly $4 billion.
"We've been looking for the opportunity to combine Builders Square, a regional business, with another party...in a consolidating industry," Robert Burton, director of Kmart's investor relations, said.
Builders Square's stores are largely in the Midwest and central United States. HomeBase has 84 stores in 10 Western states.
"It makes perfect sense," First of Michigan analyst Daniel Poole said of the combination.
But he added that Home Depot, which operates retail stores for the do-it-yourself customer and home remodeler, still poses stiff competition for the new company that will be formed by combining Builders Square and HomeBase.
Marvin Rich, Kmart's executive vice president of strategic planning, finance and administration, said the proposed transaction was part of his firm's plan for the disposition of Builders Square.
He said Kmart intends to reclassify Builders Square as a "discontinued operation" in its year-end financial statements and record a net loss of $350 million to $400 million from discontinued operations.
Burton said the combination of Builders Square and HomeBase could be completed in Kmart's fiscal first quarter, which ends in April.
"While we are in the preliminary stages of this transaction, all parties are interested in the potential opportunity that could come from combining these similar home improvement operations," Rich said.
"Clearly, there is opportunity here to create a large, financially liquid home improvement business which can be competitive on a national basis," Rich said.
Waban, which operates BJ's Wholesale Clubs as well as the HomeBase chain, said that as a result of its talks with Kmart it was suspending plans to spin off the BJ's unit.
"This (Kmart) transaction has the potential to provide Waban and its shareholders greater value than our previously announced plan to separate our BJ's Wholesale Club and HomeBase divisions through a tax-free spin-off of BJ's," Waban President Herbert J. Zarkin said in a statement.
He said that if a sale of HomeBase was concluded, the company would use the proceeds to retire corporate debt and for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock.
Kmart previously shed its speciality retail concepts, selling off to the public several companies including Borders Group Inc, The Sports Authority Inc. and OfficeMax Inc.
In 1994, Leonard Green &amp; Partners acquired PayLess Drug Stores Northwest Inc. from Kmart and merged it with Thrifty Corp. to form Thrifty Payless Inc. That chain was recently acquired by Rite Aid Corp.
K-Mart stock closed up 12.5 cents at $11.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Dayton Hudson Corp. said Friday its Mervyn's division is pulling out of Florida and Georgia and will close 10 other stores as part of its efforts to turn around that retail division.
The actions to pare a total of 35 outlets from Mervyn's chain of 300 stores are part of an ongoing consolidation of the over-saturated retail market.
"It's no secret that the retail industry is 'over-stored,'" Pamela Rucker, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation, said. "Consolidations are taking place ... Those retailers and those retail establishments that aren't performing are the ones that are going to close."
Mervyn's 25 stores in Florida and Georgia are modestly profitable, but their operating margins were below the chain average, Dayton Hudson spokeswoman Susan Eich said.
"We did have high fixed costs in terms of distribution and advertising (in Florida and Georgia) and limited market penetration," she said. "Given those two realities, it made more sense to exit those markets."
Out of the 300 stores that Mervyn's has currently, 128 are based in California. Dayton Hudson currently has a total of 1,101 stores, including 736 Target discount department stores, its largest division.
Dayton said the actions at Mervyn's will result in a pretax charge of $134 million against its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter, ending in late January.
It said the charge also covers previously announced plans to dispose of four Marshall Field's stores in Texas and close a Marshall Field's store in Park Forest, Ill. Marshall Field's is part of Dayton's Department Store Division.
The Mervyn's and Marshall Field's closings will cut a total of $505 million in annual revenue for Dayton and trim about $30 million in annual operating profit, Eich said. But that reduction in profit is expected to be largely offset by interest savings.
Dayton Hudson's operating profit for fiscal 1995 was $1 billion.
The company said Dillard Department Stores Inc. agreed to buy 10 of 18 Mervyn's locations in Florida and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. agreed to purchase three of seven Georgia locations.
The remaining properties are expected to be sold to a variety of other purchasers, it added.
Dayton said that, as a result of the real estate transactions, it expected to generate about $350 million in cash, which will be used to reduce debt and pursue growth opportunities such as opening more Target units.
Dayton has been trying to turn around its Mervyn's division and profitability has been above plan, Eich said. For the first nine months of fiscal 1996, Mervyn's operating profit was $157 million, up from $37 million a year ago.
But Mervyn's sales for the fiscal year-to-date up to Jan. 4 were down 4.3 percent, below the company's plan to have at least flat sales at stores opened for a year or more, Eich added. The company's fiscal year lasts until the end of January.
"I'm sure Florida and Georgia are the areas where they're missing plan the most," Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Barry said.
Piper Jaffray analyst Saul Yaari said he has been looking for Dayton Hudson to shed all of its Mervyn's division, focusing the company more on its Target division.
"We're looking for a total disposition of Mervyn's over the next few years," he said.
However, Dayton Chairman Robert Ulrich said in a statement that all three retail divisions -- Target, Mervyn's and Department Stores -- are core to the company's overall corporate strategy.
"We remain committed to ... improving the performance of the corporation and believe that this real estate repositioning will help us strengthen our competitive position and achieve our long-term financial goals," Ulrich said.
Dayton Hudson shares were up $1.375 at $38.25 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.

Bagel sales continue to heat up as more restaurants open across the United States, but the number of companies that will be doing most of the baking is expected to narrow.
"It's a consolidating category," said Morgan Stanley analyst Howard Penney.
For now, much of that consolidation in the $2.3 billion industry will involve smaller, regional chains being acquired by the larger, publicly traded firms.
Later on, access to capital is expected to be a key factor in determining which players emerge as dominant, analysts said. That competition appears to favor, in particular, the No. 2 chain, Einstein/Noah Bagel Corp..
"If you were to handicap the race to supremacy on that factor alone (access to capital), it would be hard not to arrive at the conclusion that Einstein is going to be the dominant chain," Piper Jaffray analyst Allan Hickok said.
Einstein/Noah Bagels currently has more than 315 stores in 27 states and the District of Columbia.
"We're now No. 2 in bagels but expect to be No. 1 by the end of 1997," said Einstein spokesman Gary Gerdemann, adding the company planned to open 300 to 350 stores this year.
Bruegger's Bagel Bakeries, a unit of Quality Dining Inc., now ranks No. 1 with 450 units in 37 states. It plans to open a "triple-digit number" of new stores this year, said Chris Romoser, a spokesman for Bruegger's. He did not give an exact figure.
"The category is growing by leaps and bounds," Romoser said. "We believe there is a lot more room for growth."
Jack Grumet, chairman of Manhattan Bagel Co., a chain of about 300 units, said much of that growth comes as small, independent units are gobbled up by the larger players.
"We see a lot of consolidation," Grumet said. "There's a lot of fear in the minds of the smaller guys with two, four, six, eight stores" as the large chains survey their markets.
He added that Manhattan Bagel, which plans to add 120 to 160 units this year through franchisees or area developers, gets offers from independents to purchase their stores.
The expanding industry reflects America's growing appetite for bagels, which date back to the late 17th century.
Sales in 1996 were an estimated $2.3 billion, up from $1.6 billion in 1995 and only $429 million in 1993, according to the Independent Bakers Association, citing industry figures.
"It's really a substitute for bread and for doughnuts," said Michael Evans, chairman of BAB Holdings Inc., which operates Big Apple Bagels.
Evans said BAB hopes open 70 to 80 units this year, expanding its network of 162 stores.
Bagel sales include products sold in grocery stores, which in the aggregate are still the leading outlet. To tap into the popularity of the bagel, breakfast cereal giant Kellogg Co. last year bought Lender's Bagels, a line of frozen grocery store bagels.
Eateries that bake fresh bagels, however, say they do not compete with the grocery stores.
"They are two separate outlets," Evans said, adding consumers often acquire a taste for bagels at the grocery store and then discover hot-from-the-oven products at restaurant chains.
"Lender's has done us a great favor," Evans said. "It has educated the consumer..."

Michael Foods Inc said Wednesday it is considering options for its potato operations, including possibly divesting the business that includes frozen french fries and refrigerated potatoes.
"We're going to be looking over the next couple of quarters as to what we're going to do with that total potato business," Gregg Ostrander, president, said in an interview here.  
The options being explored by the company, whose largest business is extended shelf-life and processed eggs, include potentially divesting the entire potato operation.
"That's one of the things we're going to explore," Ostrander said. "We're going through a lot of options now."
He said no decisions have been made as yet.
Michael Foods was among the companies presenting at an analyst conference here. Its potato product business accounted for 12 percent of the company's operating earnings in 1995.  
Minnesota-based Michael Foods is currently "number seven or eight" in frozen french fries, which continues to operate in the red, Ostrander said.
Its refrigerated potato product business is the leader in both the retail and food service categories, and continues to grow, but at a slower rate than previously, he said.
The company posted an operating profit in 1995 of $35.2 million and net earnings of $17.6 million.
Michael Foods continues to grow its egg products business, which accounted for 59 percent of its operating earnings in 1995. The company will soon close on its acquisition of Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products Inc, extending its product line in food service and retail liquid eggs.
While Papetti's and Michal Foods egg businesses will be run separately, Ostrander said he sees the potential to reap $8 million to $15 million in synergies, starting in the fourth quarter of this year.
The Papetti's deal will give Michael Foods access to East Coast egg processing operations, complementing its existing Midwest operations.

Hershey Foods Corp, already the top U.S. producer of chocolate and other confections, is looking to establish a presence in the cookie and sweet snack market.
"It's a much bigger category," William Christ, chief financial officer, said of the sweet snack category, which reaps about $30 billion annually in U.S. sales.
By contrast, chocolate and other candy has about $11 billion in annual U.S. sales.  
To go after the sweet snack market, Christ said, Hershey will look for acquisitions and develop products on its own -- including some "hybrids" that combine cookies with its trademark candies.
For example, Hershey has launched Reese's Crunchy Cookie Peanut Butter Cup, which combines a chocolate cookie and a peanut butter cup.
"There's a fine line right now between candy bars and cookies," Christ said in an interview here, where the company presented at an analyst conference on Wednesday. "Certainly there are areas that we're interested in" within the sweet snack category.  
Outside the sweet category, the future is less certain for Hershey's dry pasta business, where it is the U.S. leader.
High flour prices coupled with intense price competition have nibbled away at profit margins, although the dry pasta business remains profitable, Christ said.
"There's no plan to say today that we're sellling our pasta operations," Christ said. "As wheat prices go lower, it (dry pasta) could move closer to the growth category."  
Christ said he believes Hershey's dry pasta operations, a business it has participated in for more than 30 years, has the lowest costs in the United States.
"It still performs well," he added. "But it's not a chocolate performer. It doesn't have the same kind of margins."
Pennsylvania-based Hershey, whose products include Hershey's chocolate bars and Twizzlers licorice candies, added to its leading presence in the U.S. candy market with the $437 million acquisition in late 1996 of Leaf North America.  
The Leaf acquisition launched Hershey into the top spot among U.S. non-chocolate confectionary companies. Leaf's, whose products are one-third chocolate and two-thirds non-chocolate, has brands that include Jolly Rancher hard candies.
As the Leaf integration continues, Christ said one of the issues that remains is whether Hershey will keep Leaf's manufacturing and distribution assets in the Midwest. Hershey's manufacturing and distribution are largely concentrated on the East and West Coasts.
Hershey previously said the Leaf acquisition will cause "modest" dilution in 1997, which Christ said will probably amount to $0.05 to $0.10 a share in 1997. Analysts currently peg Hershey's 1997 earnings at $2.25 to $2.30 a share in 1997, before dilution, he added.

McDonald's Corp. Thursday reported a 12 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits, in spite of weaker U.S. results, and said it plans to cut back on its restaurant expansion.
The nation's biggest fast-food restaurant chain said its income rose to $410.0 million, including a $48.7 million after-tax charge, from $366.8 million a year ago.
The charge reflects the company's plans to close about 115 low-volume satellite units across the United States this year. As of Dec. 31, McDonald's had 2,218 satellite units, which typically have a limited menu and are located in non-traditional sites like shopping malls.
"These are really the sites that didn't pan out," said McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Mike Conley.
In 1997, McDonald's said it plans to open fewer satellite restaurants, while emphasizing full-scale units. As a result, McDonald's is trimming its overall restaurant opening plan for 1997 to between 2,400 and 2,800, compared with a previous target of 2,500 to 3,200.
"Going foward we think our emphasis is going to be traditional restaurants," Conley said in an interview.
McDonald's said more than 70 percent of the new restaurants will be outside the United States. In the past, about two-thirds of McDonald's new units have been outside the United States.
The fast-food giant, with more than 21,000 units worldwide, including 12,000 in the United States, said it is working to improve its U.S. results.
In the fourth quarter, McDonald's said its U.S. operating income fell 28 percent, including the charge, to $217.7 million. Excluding the charge, U.S. operating income fell 4 percent.
As analysts had expected, McDonald's said its domestic same store sales -- measuring results from units open at least a year -- were down in the fourth quarter and for all of 1996 compared with a year earlier.
Offsetting the decline domestically was a 14 percent gain in international operating income and an 11 percent rise in sales in the fourth quarter.
In the United States, however, McDonald's performance fell short of its goals, according to Jack Greenburg, company vice chairman and chairman-U.S.A. "In 1997, our focus will be squarely on improving sales at existing restaurants through improvements in marketing, service and menu," he said in a statement.
Conley said McDonald's will continue to be aggressive on pricing in the face of competition, but declined to give any specifics.
"We want to provide the best value to our customers ... and a big part of it is price," he said. "You'll see us being aggressive on price-value as we always have been."
Schroder Wertheim analyst Wayne Daniels said he expects McDonald's to launch more national price promotions in 1997, as opposed to its current practice of giving franchisees the option to offer local promotions.
"(McDonald's) average ticket did climb during 1996," when it launched higher-priced premium sandwiches such as the Arch Deluxe, Daniels said. "I do think that they will reverse that somewhat as they are a little more aggressive on national price promotions."
Conley said McDonald's will continue to work on food taste, but said changes would be "evolutionary and not revolutionary."
"So don't expect a spate of new products," he said. "That's really unlikely."
McDonald's stock gained $1.125 to $46.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The stock of Kellogg Co. fell Thursday after it warned about lower earnings this year and sparked concerns that it could resort to increased promotions to protect its leading market share, analysts said.
The leading producer in the $9 billion U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market said late Wednesday that its third-quarter earnings would be about 20 percent below the $1.05 a share it earned a year earlier, when it posted net income of $230 million.
Kellogg also said that, while it expected earnings will increase in the fourth quarter, its full-year profits for 1996 will be less than the $3.48 a year it earned in 1995. For all of 1995, Kellogg posted net income of $761.6 million before one-time charges.
Kellogg's stock was off $1.125 to $67.375 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.
Kellogg made the announcement just after the close of trading on the NYSE Wednesday and in after-hours electronic trading its stock had fallen as low as $66.125.
The Battle Creek, Mich.-based company blamed competitive promotions by others in the cereal category for the decline in its third-quarter profits.
Earlier this year Kellogg and other leading cereal makers cut retail cereal prices. At the same time, Kellogg reduced promotional spending, such as offering special discounts in supermarkets.
Kellogg said it has cut back on promotional spending for more than two years.
"We will continue to direct our efforts away from deep price promotion; however, we are unwilling to see our leadership position comprised," Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement issued late Wednesday.
Analysts interpreted that as a warning that Kellogg might cut prices further or increase its own promotional spending if competitors continue their promotional practices in an effort to gain market share.
Kellogg accounts for nearly one-third of the U.S. cereal market, followed by General Mills Inc. with about one-quarter of U.S. sales. Third-place Post Cereals, including its Nabisco brands, accounts for about 17 percent of the U.S. market.
"It appears that Kellogg will be forced to deviate from its strategy of reducing promotions and will increase promotions to defend its market share," BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said.
On Thursday O'Neil reduced his estimate for Kellogg's 1996 earnings to $3.10 a share from $3.30 and his 1997 estimate to $3.60 a share from $3.70.
"If competitors do not scale back their promotional spending, (Kellogg) may reaccelerate its own spending or resort to another price cut," Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez wrote in a report.
Earlier this year Kellogg had predicted its earnings for 1996 would match the $3.48 a share it earned in 1995.
While many analysts at the time questioned Kellogg's ability to meet that target, the magnitude of the drop in the current earnings outlook took the market by surprise.

McDonald's Corp.'s plan to offer deep discounts on its fast food, including 55-cent sandwiches, is a risky promotion that could hurt profits and sour relations with franchisees, analysts said Thursday.
"I think that (price promotion) strategy is flawed, to put it bluntly," said analyst Roger Lipton of Lipton Financial Services.
Instead of cutting prices, Lipton added, McDonald's needs to focus on "higher-quality products and better service."
McDonald's, which beefed up its menu offerings last year with a new "Deluxe" line of sandwiches, defends its products with its sales figures.
"We're a global leader. We serve 35 million customers around the world each day," said McDonald's spokeswoman Anna Rozenich. "Certainly we're doing something right."
Under the proposed promotion plan, the fast-food giant would feature one sandwich -- such as its Big Mac -- for 55 cents when a customer also buys french fries and a drink.
Short term, that will bring more customers into McDonald's, said Josh Rosen, an analyst at ABN AMRO Chicago Corp.
But longer term, the 55-cent promotion, which is expected to apply to a different sandwich each month, could backfire. "By selling a Big Mac at 55 cents, you are telegraphing to consumers that's what it's worth," said Rosen.
However, Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes applauded the 55-cent promotion, which he said will help McDonald's build incremental customer traffic. He said the promotion is akin to McDonald's "extra value meals," which were launched six years ago and became McDonald's most successful item in the last 10 years.
Some franchisees are concerned, however, that the promotion, which could run about 12 months, may hurt profit margins.
"McDonald's is intent on raising top line sales and showing (positive) U.S. (same store) sales," said Dick Adams, head of the Consortium, a group of independent McDonald's franchisees. "Franchisees are interested in top line sales, but only as it relates to bottom line profits."
McDonald's, which has not commented on the details of its planned promotion, said its interests are aligned with those of its more than 2,700 franchisees in the United States.
"When our franchisees are doing well, we're doing well," McDonald's Rozenich said. About 80 percent of McDonald's U.S. restaurants are franchises.
Many of McDonald's U.S. franchisees have been upset by lower U.S. same-store sales trends, which some have blamed on the fast-food giant's rapid expansion, franchise sources said.
"Cannibalization (when a new unit draws sales away from an existing one) is a big issue with a lot of people," said one franchisee, who asked not to be named.
While competitors such as Wendy's International Inc. and Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, said they will not follow with price cuts, McDonald's promotion likely will draw some customers away.
"They're going to take some business from people. There is a segment of the population that will gravitate to McDonald's to buy Big Macs at 55 cents," said Sid Feltenstein, chairman of A&amp;W Restaurants Inc., a chain of 800 units.
However, based on current menu prices at a downtown Chicago McDonald's, a customer would pay $3.01 for a 55-cent Big Mac along with a medium-sized french fries and medium-sized drink. That would be a savings of 48 cents compared with the $3.49 Big Mac extra value meal at the same McDonald's.
Asked Feltenstein: "Are people to go out of their way to save (48 cents)?"

Kellogg Co, whose profits for 1996 are under pressure from price cuts and promotions, threw down the gauntlet that it will take the necessary steps to preserve its category leadership, which may mean further discounts, analysts said.
"They (Kellogg) might cut prices again or increase promotions again," said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette analyst William Leach.
On Wednesday, Chairman Arnold Langbo said Kellogg will direct its efforts away from deep price promotion.  
"..However, we are unwilling to see our leadership position compromised," Langbo added in a statement.
Earlier this year, Kellogg, General Mills Inc and the Post Cereal division of Philip Morris Cos Inc cut retail prices in an effort to spark a sluggish category.
"On balance consumers want lower prices still," Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz said. "They'll either get that in the form of lower list prices or extraordinarily high levels of promotion."  
While many analysts had expected Kellogg to report earnings below last year's $3.48 a share, the magnitude of the potential decline did come as a surprise for some.
"Their guidance has been much different," added Leach, who had been projecting full-year earnings of $3.15 a share.
In July, analysts said Kellogg was still guiding them that earnings for 1996 would match 1995 levels.
According to First Call, the consensus for 1996 earnings has been $3.35 a share, with a range of $3.15 to $3.50.  
Kellogg said it now believes earnings for the third quarter will be about 20 percent below the $1.05 per share earned in the 1995 period. It added that while earnings per share will grow in the fourth quarter, results for the full year will be less than $3.48 a share.
Kellogg said its results for the third quarter were hurt by competitive promotions in the U.S. cereal category.
In a report issued in late August, BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said there had been a disparity in promotional spending among major cereal manufacturers. Post, he said, continued some discounting and General Mills maintained an Olympics-themed promotion while Kellogg reduced promotion efforts after cutting prices.
"The impact was a loss of market share" for Kellogg, O'Neil wrote.

Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche Holding AG agreed on Wednesday to acquire Tastemaker, an international manufacturer of food flavorings, from two U.S. chemical companies in a deal worth about $1.1 billion.
St. Louis-based Mallinckrodt Inc., which also makes drugs and other medical products, and Hercules Inc. of Wilmington, Del., each said they expected to net $550 million from the transaction.
Tastemaker, a Cincinnati-based company that makes flavoring and citrus specialities used in foods and beverages, has about 1,280 employees in the United States, Holland, England, Mexico, Australia and Japan. It had 1996 sales of about $320 million.
Roche said Tastemaker will be strategic fit with its Givaudan-Roure unit, an international fragrances, flavors and aroma chemicals business. Givaudan-Roure had consolidated sales of 1.4 billion Swiss francs ($981 million) in 1996.
Roche's other core businesses include pharmaceuticals, vitamins and fine chemicals, and diagnostics.
For Mallinckrodt and Hercules, the deal enables the two companies to shed a venture that they formed in 1992 by combining their smaller food ingredient and flavors businesses.
"We've said that we would look for the best way to create value (from the Tastemaker venture)," Hercules spokeswoman Amy Binder said.
She added that Hercules, a speciality chemical company, will use its cash proceeds to repurchase shares. Hercules shares gained 62.5 cents to $47 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
Mallinckrodt said it expected to use part of its proceeds to buy back up to $250 million in stock over the next 18 months and also will look for acquisitions to build its human health care business.
Mallinckrodt's $550 million deal with Roche includes the Swiss company assuming about $500 million of Mallinckrodt debt. That, analysts said, puts Mallinckrodt in a better position to make acquisitions.
Last August, Mallinckrodt said it would seek a buyer for its Tastemaker venture and would "explore options" for its animal health division while focusing on its core businesses of speciality chemicals and human health care.
"We have said explicitly that we expect to use proceeds from (Tastemaker) and from our animal health business ... for strategic acquisitions," said Cole Lannum, director of investor relations for Mallinckrodt.
Asked if a potential sale of the animal health business was pending, Lannum said it was "certainly possible that we'll have a deal by the end of the fiscal year" which ends in June.
Future acquisitions for Mallinckrodt likely would be in the hospital supply area, which includes pharmaceuticals. Mallinckrodt makes analgesic drugs, diagnostic imaging agents, medical devices and other pharmaceutical products.
"Mallinckrodt gets the liquidity that they're looking for to reinvest in their core business, especially on the medical side," A.G. Edwards analyst Gary Stevenson said of the deal.
Mallincrkrodt's stock fell 25 cents to $40.25 in late afternoon after trading as high as $41.50 earlier in the day on the New York Stock Exchange.
Roche is a worldwide research-based health care group with 50,000 employees in more than 100 countries. It recorded 1996 sales of about 16 billion Swiss francs ($11.2 billion).

An investigation by Japan's securities watchdog into possibly illegal deals at Nomura Securities Co Ltd is unlikely to be concluded quickly, a government source said on Tuesday.
The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) has been investigating since last September and the probe is now centred on whether and how Nomura provided profits to a corporate customer, the source told Reuters.
The source said the investigation is likely to take at least a few more weeks, and urged Nomura to cooperate fully.  
"To complete the investigation as soon as possible, extraordinary cooperation is needed from Nomura," he said, adding that until recently Nomura was not as cooperative as the authorities might have hoped.
Under the Securities and Exchange Law, the SESC could advise the finance minister to hand down administrative punishment if it finds evidence of illegal activity. The heaviest penalty would be revocation of brokerage licences and suspension of business for up to six months.
Under the law, the SESC could also pass the case to prosecutors to pursue legal action.  
Nomura said last week that two of its directors made deals suspected to be "discretionary" transactions, meaning they were done without the client's knowledge, and moved profits raised from Nomura's own funds into a corporate client's account, practices banned under Japan's securities law. Media reports have linked the firm with a former "sokaiya" racketeer.
Nomura Securities has said it could not confirm the media reports that the corporate client was run by a relative of a "sokaiya".
Sokaiya are people who extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting, or by offering to prevent a disruption of the proceedings. Japanese commercial law has prohibited paying off racketeers since 1982.
A Nomura spokesman said the company did not know how long it would take for the SESC to complete its investigation.
"We must make utmost efforts to restore people's trust... But we are now at a halfway stage (as the SESC investigation has not yet finished)," he said.
He said two company executives involved in the irregular dealings scandal resigned as managing directors as of Monday, but said they would stay at the company to help its in-house investigation into the deals.  
Industry sources said that the longer the SESC investigation lasts, the greater will be the damage to Nomura's business and reputation.
An executive at a life insurance company said: "I was very shocked at the news as Nomura, a leading company in Japan's securities industry, seems to have repeated its wrong-doing after similar scandals (in 1991)."
Several Japanese investment management companies have suspended business dealings with Nomura in light of the scandal.
"Such business suspensions will continue at least until the SESC completes its investigation and official actions are decided upon," the insurance executive said.

Japanese life insurers, already unhappy at having to help out ailing Nippon Credit Bank, are angry at the Finance Ministry which they say has ignored trouble at failed insurer Nissan Mutual Life for years.
"The responsibility of the Finance Ministry is heavy," a life insurance company official, who declined to be named, said on Friday.
"The ministry has not taken any appropriate action to inform Nissan insurance's policy holders of the company's troubles.
"Nissan's annual reports (over the past two years) did not give any hint that liabilities of the company would exceed its assets by 200 billion yen ($1.58 billion)," he said.
On Friday, Japan suffered the first failure of a life insurance firm in its post-war history when Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co was ordered by the Finance Ministry to start shutting down its business.
The president of the medium-sized insurer, Hiroshi Yonemoto, said at a news conference that the company had been suffering from excessive liabilities for the last three to four years, stemming from the bursting of Japan's "bubble era" of inflated real estate and stock prices in the late 1980s.
"We sharply increased our assets during the bubble economy period, but the bubble burst and low interest rates have continued."
He said that the company had taken restructuring steps, but gave up such efforts and continuation of its business due to a loss in the last business year ended March 31.
The Finance Ministry, for its part, pointed the finger of blame for the firm's failure at the management of Nissan Life.
The financial situation of Nissan Life is "abnormal" and management responsibility is "heavy", Makoto Fukuda, a senior Finance Ministry official, told reporters.
He said that the ministry had found that Nissan Life's financial condition was substantially worse then when it conducted an inspection of the company in September 1995.
But he added: "In September 1995, we did not think its business was in a crisis."
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka pledged to protect Nissan Life's policy holders and the Life Insurance Association of Japan, an industry body representing life insurers, said it would work out a liquidation scheme.
Kenjiro Hata, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan, said that a scheme to wind up Nissan Life was expected to be ready in two to three weeks.
Hata told reporters that the insurance body wants to seek capital contributions from major clients of of Nissan Life, such as Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Hitachi Ltd if a new company is set up to take over Nissan Life's business.
The insurer also owns shares in Nissan Motor and Hitachi.
However, industry sources said that it would take some time for the association to work out the scheme.
And even if a company is set up to take over Nissan Life's business, those life insurers who take over the policies of Nissan Life would have to bear a financial burden for a long time since nearly half of Nissan Life's assets are individual pension policies that have guaranteed high returns.
Normally, such high-yield policies account for only seven percent of a life insurer's assets. Protecting policy holders would mean guaranteeing the returns that have been promised until the policies mature, they said.
However, they said that members of the body, now totalling 44, would agree to cough up a total of 200 billion yen ($1.58 billion) to a new company to make up for the estimated excessive liabilities to protect Nissan Life's policy holders.
Earlier this month, ailing Nippon Credit Bank asked both life and non-life insurers to buy a total of 97 billion yen ($769 million) worth of ordinary shares to be newly issued under a radical restructuring plan which was supported by the Finance Ministry.

The criminal complaint filed against Nomura Securities Co Ltd on Tuesday reveals a widening circle of players in a pay-off scandal that has rocked the firm, dashing its hopes for a quick end to the affair.
Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors alleging that Nomura, two former executives and a former general manager compensated a client for investment losses, government sources said.
The sources said what was unusual about the latest scandal were revelations that company executives had asked junior staff to conduct illegal deals to compensate clients for stock trading losses for a long time.
But the securities watchdog decided not to take action against the junior staffers involved in the illegal deals, the sources said.
"The SESC decided not file a complaint against Nomura staff who had been actually involved in the transactions," a government source said.
Besides the brokerage, the SESC took action against former Nomura directors Shimpei Matsuki and Nobutaka Fujikura, both of whom resigned on March 10 as directors after Nomura's internal probe found they had made discretionary deals banned under Japanese securities law and funnelled profits to the corporate client.
The other was former general manager Osamu Fujita, who made the transactions under Fujikura's orders, the sources said.
They also said that Nomura continued the practice of making illegal compensation payments even after it was involved in an industry-wide loss compensation scandal in 1991.
Since the scandal was revealed by Nomura itself on March 6, the company's executives, including then president Hideo Sakamaki, insisted that they believed only the two former directors were involved in the pay-offs.
Sakamaki has since been forced to step down to take responsibility for the scandal.
With the SESC's latest move, the focus has now shifted to when the Finance Minister will impose penalties on Nomura and how severe they will be.
Analysts said that Nomura's business results for 1997/98 will depend on when and how hard the Ministry of Finance (MOF) comes down on Nomura.
If administrative penalties are severe and the ramifications extend into the second half of 1997/98, Nomura may be forced to post losses in 1997/98, they said.
The Japanese watchdog lacks the right to take punitive action itself but can recommend that the finance minister mete out administrative punishment and can ask prosecutors to take legal action against possible criminal violations.
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka has said that the ministry would impose strict penalties against Nomura if the SESC were to propose that administrative action be taken against the company.
The sources said the securities watchdog would start drawing up its recommendations for penalties against Japan's top brokerage now that it had filed a complaint with prosecutors.
However, they said it was too early to say how long it would take the SESC to present its proposals to MOF.
A senior Finance Ministry official said after the scandal was revealed that MOF was focusing on whether Nomura had violated the commercial code, rather than the securities law. If the SESC investigation finds that pay-offs were made to a racketeer, the ministry will impose severe administrative penalties against Nomura, he said.
However, the client at the centre of the latest Nomura scandal was not included in the complaints, as the SESC could not confirm the role of the client.
In late March, prosecutors said that the client was linked to a "sokaiya" racketeer. Sokaiya extort money from a company by threatening to disturb a shareholders' meeting, and Japan's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to racketeers since 1982.

Japan's deposit insurance system is expected to seek loans from banks through a tender later this year for the first time, financial sources say.
They said the move could fuel fears that funds available in the system may not be enough to protect depositors.
The tender would be aimed at repaying stopgap loans provided by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to the semi-governmental Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC).
The DIC borrowed 500 billion yen ($4.13 billion) from the central bank last month to pay 1.03 trillion yen ($8.5 billion) to a liquidation scheme for failed credit union Kizu Shinyo Kumiai.
The tender would take place after June, when financial institutions make half-yearly payments of deposit insurance premiums, which will cover part of the BOJ loans, they said.
In the tender, which would not be mandatory, banks would indicate interest rates on loans and the DIC would select those with lower rates.
"After such a huge amount of money was used for the Kizu scheme, we are increasingly worried about whether and how the DIC will protect depositors' money in the event of any large bank failure in future," said a bank official.
The deposit insurance system, set up in 1971, is designed to help prevent a financial crisis and protect depositors from any financial failures.
The DIC was dormant until 1992, but it has used a total of 2.05 trillion yen ($16.9 billion) in the past five years to bail out troubled financial institutions and cover losses stemming from a series of financial failures since 1995.
In addition, the DIC must provide funds to help wind up already failed regional bank Hanwa Bank and small credit union Sanpuku Shinyo Kumiai, the sources said.
Finance Ministry officials also said recently that bank debentures issued by long-term credit banks may be covered by the deposit insurance system until March 31, 2001, in order to protect creditors holding the debentures.
An official of the DIC said, however, that it had sufficient funds to deal with possible future problems at financial institutions.
Under financial bills passed by parliament last June aimed at solving Japan's problem loan mess, the DIC boosted the insurance premiums which financial institutions pay by seven times, to 0.084 percent of total deposits from 0.012 percent.
This means the DIC will get 500 billion yen ($4.13 billion) in premiums a year until 2001, the official said. Under the financial bills, it can also borrow a total of two trillion yen ($16.5 billion) from the central bank as stopgap funds.
But analysts and even influential politicians are not optimistic.
Takeo Nishioka, secretary-general of Japan's main opposition New Frontier Party, said in a television programme last weekend that the present deposit insurance system could not cope with bank failures.
At the end of September, Japan's deposit-taking financial institutions had 29.23 trillion yen ($239 billion) of problem loans, of which 7.3 trillion yen ($59.8 billion) had not been covered by loan-loss provisions and collateral, Finance Ministry data shows.
Analysts say the actual amount of problem loans must be more than double the official figure. If regulators want to deal with insolvent financial firms seriously, there are potentially three measures they can take, analysts say.
The first is to boost deposit insurance premiums and the second is the use of loans provided by the Bank of Japan.
But the central bank is unwilling to have its money used to bail out financial institutions, and it is difficult to keep on increasing the premiums that institutions must pay the DIC.
"So the final source is public money, and politicians are beginning to try to establish measures to cope with the situation," said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Center.
But it is no easy task to establish such measures after a storm of public criticism that blew up last year over the use of 685 billion yen ($5.66 billion) in taxpayers' money to help resolve bad loans held at collapsed housing loan companies.
"The key is whether the authorities can avoid emotional reactions from the public," said Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. "While we believe public money is needed to ensure the stability of Japan's financial system, it may take a long time to reach a decision." ($1=122 yen)

Despite the pressures caused by a weak Tokyo stock market, Japan's top 20 banks will stick to their plans to dispose of 4.5 trillion to 5.0 trillion yen worth of problem loans for the 1996/97 year to March 31, banking analysts said on Thursday.
In the first half of 1996/97, the 20 banks had already unloaded problem loans worth 2.37 trillion yen by loan loss provisions and other measures.
"Though stock prices are weaker, (big) banks are moving ahead to dispose of problem loans as they had planned," said Yukiko Ohara, UBS Securities Co Ltd.
On Thursday, the 225-share Nikkei average ended up 30.64 points, or 0.16 percent, at 19,021.56.
A spokeswoman at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd said that the bank had not changed its plans to dispose of about 330 billion yen of problem loans in 1996/97.
A spokesman at Yasuda &amp; Banking Co Ltd also said it will go ahead with its plan to dispose of about 300 billion yen in problem loans for 1996/97.
As of the end of September, the 20 banks had 17.4 trillion yen in problem loans, the Finance Ministry said.
But many analysts have said that the actual amount is more than double that because of falling land prices and the huge exposure to construction and non-bank financial sectors.
Some of the stronger banks, such as Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd, will set additional loan loss reserves for the bad loans sold to the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co Ltd (CCPC) in the latter half of 1996/97, analysts said.
The CCPC was set up in 1993 to buy problem loans and recover those loans. Between March 1993 and September 1996, it bought 9,075 problem loans for 5.23 trillion yen against a total book value of 12.92 trillion yen.
But banks will need to fill the gap between the sale price to CCPC and the current low value of the loan's collateralized land, because land prices have dropped about 70 to 80 percent from the peak levels, analysts said.
Merrill Lynch Japan Inc analyst Yoshinobu Yamada said that many of the top 20 are able to cut the amount of their publicly-known problem loans to manageable levels in 1996/97 or in the next business year, if stock prices do not fall sharply from current levels at the end of March.
Shares in the banking sector  O#BNK.T weakened on Thursday on renewed selling spurred by a growing belief that the shares had already reached their upward limits, brokers said.
Sentiment was still bearish for the banking sector on worries over the bad loans.
But bank shares will not recover from a simple disclosure and a write-off of their bad loans, unless each bank shows a strong will to boost profitability and to cope with Tokyo's "Big Bang" financial deregulation, Ohara said.
Yamada said he expects low interest rates in the latter half of the current business year would increase operating profits at the 20 banks by about 10 percent from 4.07 trillion yen projected last November by the banks for 1996/97.
But Japan's economic recovery is slow, so new problem loans may emerge, he said.
"For bank shares to recover, authorities must ensure the stability of the financial system, even if by injecting public money into it, and also give their assurance that the economic recovery will not falter," he added.

Dozens of Japanese banks may close their foreign operations in the next few years as their huge problem loans make it hard to meet new capital requirements, analysts say.
Two of Japan's top 20 banks have already announced they will shut down their overseas branches, and some analysts say many others should follow suit, delivering possible boosts to profitability.
"Japanese banks must cut unprofitable assets overseas to boost return on equity," said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president of Smith Barney International Inc.
"All that many of them are doing overseas is providing services to Japanese customers, rather than doing business with local customers in host countries. They are doing Japanese business even in overseas markets."
He said that over the next few years, the number of Japanese banks operating abroad could fall to about a third of the current 85. There are a total of 149 banks in Japan.
Earlier this month, two of Japan's most troubled banks, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB) and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd announced restructuring plans that included pulling out of overseas operations. Hokkaido also said it would merge with regional bank Hokkaido Bank Ltd.
Hokkaido Bank closed its overseas offices last year, saying they were not profitable.
Financial authorities, worried that Japan's banking problems could destabilise global financial markets, do not object to Japanese banks closing overseas.
Sei Nakai, senior deputy director-general of the Finance Ministry's banking bureau, recently told Reuters the ministry had proposed the step to NCB and Hokkaido Takushoku to avoid the possibility of Japanese banks troubling foreign creditors.
He also said the ministry might tell other Japanese banks to retreat "quietly" from their overseas operations if they were in trouble.
Analysts say tougher capital adequacy requirements scheduled to be introduced from the end of March 1998 under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) could encourage Japanese banks to close their international operations.
James Fiorillo, a financial analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd, said some Japanese banks were expected to try to boost their capital to meet the BIS requirements. But others would likely take a second look at continuing internationally.
Under BIS capital adequacy requirements set in the late 1980s, Japanese banks operating internationally need capital equivalent to a minimum of 8.0 percent of risk-weighted assets.
In 1995, the BIS set second-stage guidelines that factor in market risk when determining capital requirements. This means Japanese banks operating abroad will have to take into account risks from activities such as foreign exchange transactions and swaps when calculating adequacy ratios from this fiscal year.
Some analysts calculate that the introduction of these second-stage guidelines could cut international capital adequacy ratios of Japanese banks by up to 0.3 percent.
Katsuhiro Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Center, said major commercial, trust and long-term credit banks and big regional banks would not abandon overseas operations.
But smaller regional banks burdened by problem loans would do so as their low credit ratings had made it increasingly expensive for them to raise capital, he said.
Sasajima said some Japanese banks would likely seek foreign partners in order to maintain their services abroad.
Earlier this month, NCB said it would tie up with Bankers Trust New York Corp to help turn some of its loans into cash and to maintain services to overseas customers.

Japan's securities watchdog filed complaints with prosecutors Tuesday alleging that Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Japan's biggest brokerage, and three former executives made illegal to payments to a client.
While the regulators did not identify the client, he is believed to be one of Japan's "sokaiya" racketeers, who extort money from corporations by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings.
Japan's commercial law has prohibited payoffs to such racketeers since 1982.
Government sources said the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission complaints allege that Nomura and the employees made illegal payments to the client totalling 49.7 million yen ($417,600).
It was the first time that regulators have charged that the company was itself involved in the scandal. Nomura has repeatedly denied any participation in the scam, saying it was the work of three former executives.
It is now up to prosecutors to determine if there is enough evidence to file charges in the case.
In a sign that the probe may have a sweeping impact on Nomura, the SESC said that some of the improper orders were handled by more junior employees, which could bring more names into the scandal.
Nomura issued a statement apologising for the scandal.
"We deeply apologise for the inconvenience the scandal has caused to our customers and the public," it said.
"We are taking the complaints seriously...We will make a 'fresh start' to prevent a recurrence of such events."
The government sources said the SESC would start drawing up proposals for civil penalties against Nomura immediately. But they added that it was too early to say how long it would take the SESC to present the proposals to the Finance Ministry.
Market sources say the Finance Ministry may suspend part of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as punishment for the scandal.
That would be the heaviest ever penalty imposed on a securities firm in Japan.
The scandal has already casted a long shadow over Nomura's business and prompted many clients to shun the financial powerhouse.
In March alone, Nomura's current profit dropped to about half the usual monthly levels due to the scandal, which cut its brokerage commissions and its share of the underwriting market, a company executive said in April.
Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo bourse fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it had held since February 1992.
In the first fallout from the SEC action, the Ministry of Finance said late Tuesday that Nomura was being suspended from taking part in Japanese Government Bond auctions and underwriting activities.
Nomura's admission in March that two of its directors were involved in transferring Nomura money into the account of a corporate client linked to a sokaiya racketeer was a major blow to the image of the Japanese brokering industry.
In 1991, Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were found to be paying improper compensation to favoured clients. Top executives at Nomura resigned that year over payments and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters.
Nomura made a sweeping reshuffle of its top management late last month in an effort to win back public trust in the wake of the scandal.

Japan's securities industry reacted cooly on Thursday to draft proposals by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to speed up the implementation of the government's "Big Bang" reform plan.
According to a draft report obtained by Reuters, the LDP's administrative reform panel proposes deregulating 19 financial areas from April, 1998, including abolishing the securities transactions tax and liberalising brokerage commissions on stock transactions.
The proposals also call for allowing banks' securities subsidiaries to engage in stock broking business in 1998/99; enabling banks to sell investment trust funds through their branch networks in the same year, and allowing leasing and credit firms to issue commercial paper from 1997/98.
"The financial areas in the report cover most areas in which deregulation must be considered," said Takashi Kanasaki, a managing director at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd.
"But we don't think all the steps and the time tables to implement Big Bang reforms will be decided by the LDP alone as the Finance Ministry is also working out realistic steps to do so," he said.
Last November, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto unveiled a five-year plan to liberalise Japan's financial markets and catch up with reforms carried out more than a decade ago in Europe and North America.
A special committee of an advisory panel to the Finance Ministry is currently working out measures to realise the Big Bang" reforms. It will finalise its proposals by June.
Industry sources said that the ministry would come up with necessary changes in financial laws by early next year.
A LDP source said that the report will be a blueprint for discussion among panel members in order to help the government finalise a broader deregulation package by the end of March.
Kanasaki said that he expected brokerage commissions on stock transactions and the securities transaction tax to be deregulated in 1998 as stated in the LDP's draft proposals.
"Unless Japan tries to cut trading costs by deregulating such areas as securities transactions tax and commissions next year, we will see a hollowing out of Tokyo financial markets because Japan will liberalise the foreign exchange control system next year," he said. "Local investors will place orders for local stock transactions abroad if costs are cheaper there."
The cabinet submitted a bill revising the foreign exchange control law to parliament earlier this week. It enables freer cross-border capital transactions and settlements by individuals and corporations from April, 1998.
Yasuyuki Fujita, a senior economist at Nomura Research Institute, said some of the LDP's draft proposals were not realistic.
He said discussions would be needed on how to allow banks' securities arms to join the stock broking business, as banks, major holders of Japanese stocks, can influence the corporate decision-making process.
Analysts said that it is still difficult to predict who would be the winners after Big Bang, although top commercial banks and brokers are likely candidates.
"All financial sectors agree on the general gist of the Big Bang reforms but they expect harsh problems in their business if specific issues are implemented," said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre.

Scandal-tainted Japanese brokerage Nomura Securities Co plunged into the red on a net basis last business year after incurring a hefty special loss due to a cash injection to a troubled subsidiary.
But the nation's biggest brokerage said on Thursday it enjoyed a healthy jump in its current profit in the year to March, helped by income from bond trading and underwriting.
Nomura, mired in controversy over a scandal linking it with "sokaiya" racketeers, said it posted a parent net loss 271.51 billion yen ($2.15 billion) in 1996/97 against a profit of 23.1 billion yen ($183 million) in 1995/96.
This largely reflects a special loss of 371 billion yen ($2.94 billion) resulting from Nomura's aid to its troubled financial affiliate Nomura Finance Co.
The brokerage meanwhile recorded a parent current profit of 124.19 billion yen ($985 million) in the year, up 35.7 percent year-on-year and the highest in six years. Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains and losses made on investments.
On a group basis, Nomura said it posted a net loss of 91.07 billion yen ($722 million) in 1996/97 after a profit of 81.27 billion yen ($645 million) the year before under U.S. accounting rules.
Japan's securities industry suffered a major setback last month when Nomura said two of its directors were involved in suspected illegal deals in which substantial sums of Nomura money were moved to the account of a corporate customer who was linked to a sokaiya.
The outlook for Nomura's business remains gloomy. It has already been hit hard by the scandal, which has led many clients to refrain from trading with it.
In March alone, Nomura's current profit dropped to about half the usual monthly levels due to the scandal, which cut its brokerage commissions and its share of the underwriting market, a company executive said on Thursday.
"As one might expect, the scandal has had an effect (on our profits)," Nomura director Takamichi Arata told reporters. But he added it was hard to calculate the extent of the impact.
Arata said the brokerage hopes to post a parent current profit this month and in succeeding months by cutting operating costs.
Nomura was cutting its monthly operating expenditures to between 20.2 billion and 20.3 billion yen (about $161 million) per month in April, down two billion yen ($15.8 million) from March, he said. That would be 22 percent below the peak of 26 billion yen ($206 million) five years ago, Arata said.
Nomura's share of trading volume on the Tokyo bourse fell to 9.2 percent in March from 11.4 percent in February, toppling it from the top spot it had held since February 1992.
Analysts said the fate of Nomura's business this financial year hinges on how hard the Ministry of Finance comes down on the brokerage after regulators complete their investigation.
Japanese media reports say the authorities could suspend some of Nomura's operations, including stock dealing on its own account, for about three months as a penalty for the scandal.
Such a penalty would be the heaviest ever imposed on a securities firm in Japan.
Nomura on Monday announced that its president and 15 board members will resign on May 1 to take responsibility for the scandal. ($1=126 yen)

Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday raided the country's biggest brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, in a dramatic sign of a widening probe into payments to a client linked to racketeers.
The late afternoon raid on Nomura headquarters in central Tokyo was by both prosecutors and officials of the nation's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC).
The highly public raids, preceded by tipoffs to the media that they were imminent, appeared to signal that the action against Nomura could become a showcase as Japan seeks to clean up business practices and deregulate its economy.
Coinciding with the headquarters raid, another 90 officials swooped on 10 other locations and for the first time formally spelled out the suspicions in detail.
Deputy chief prosecutor Kunihiro Matsuo told reporters the raids were to investigate a Nomura director's illegal payment of 38 million yen ($309,000) to a company run by a relative of a racketeer to avoid disruption of a Nomura annual meeting.
Matsuo said the other raids included searches of the homes of the racketeer or "sokaiya" and the Nomura director involved in the scandal, Shimpei Matsuki.
The scandal surfaced on March 6 and Matsuki and fellow director Nobutaka Fujikura resigned on March 10 after internal probes found they made discretionary deals banned under Japanese law and funnelled profits to a front company for the racketeer.
Sokaiya, often linked to "yakuza" crime syndicates, extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called "sokai" in Japanese.
Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down on March 14 to atone for the scandal. He became an adviser to the company, and chairman Masashi Suzuki took over his position while retaining the chairmanship.
Nomura, one of the world's most powerful financial institutions, is involved in bond and share trading.
It exerts a powerful influence on every business in the yen bond market and is also Japan's top foreign bond seller.
The company has seen key foreign and domestic clients suspend business with it since the scandal broke.
Nomura has been a key player in Japanese financial markets for most of this century, underwriting firms such as Sony Corp, which were part of Japan's postwar economic miracle.
In a scene akin to a Japanese film, 90 officials in business suits, led by a man with a briefcase, marched military-style through the front doors of Nomura's modernistic headquarters.
They firmly locked the doors, shutting out journalists gathered for a raid designed to have maximum publicity value.
Reports that the raids were imminent hit Nomura's share price, which ended the day down 20 yen (16 cents) at 1,440 ($11.70).
But brokers said the impact of the news was limited as the market had expected such a development.
"What the market is more concerned about is any punitive measures which will be taken against the brokerage," said Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities Co Ltd general manager.
"The punishment will probably have an effect on the firm's business and could have an impact on the whole brokerage industry as well," Ueki said.
The investigation comes six years after Nomura and other leading Japanese brokerages were hit by a scandal over improper compensation to favoured clients.
Top executives at Nomura resigned in 1991 over the improper compensation and revelations that affiliates had done deals with gangsters.

The United States appears to be getting sucked ever deeper into Colombia's drug war, where the lines between counternarcotics and counterinsurgency are increasingly blurred, political analysts say.
U.S. officials, who will announce this week whether to "certify" Colombia as a trustworthy ally in the anti-drug fight, are publicly critical of its failure to crack down hard enough on the twin scourges of cocaine and heroin.
But Western diplomats and analysts say it is not Colombians but a "massive" contingent of U.S. advisers, both military and civilian, who have dictated counternarcotics strategy behind the scenes since the early 1970s.
Those advisers have long known they were battling an elusive enemy of peasant farmers who tend illicit plantations, money-laundering bankers and corrupt politicians as well as the drug kingpins themselves.
Now for the first time Washington appears to be taking seriously claims by Colombian authorities that leftist guerrillas have become major drug traffickers. The guerrillas deny the allegation and say it is being used as a pretext for increasingly direct U.S. intervention on Colombian soil.
"We must recognise the decisive role played by some elements of Colombia's insurgent guerrilla groups," Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard told the U.S. Congress on Feb. 14. "Those groups constitute a real threat to Colombian anti-drug forces deployed to eradicate (drug) fields and the American personnel who support them."
Allegations of rebel ties to the drug trade date back to the late 1980s, when then U.S. envoy Lewis Tambs coined the phrase "narco-guerrillas." It may be no coincidence that U.S. officials are reviving the issue at a time when the Colombian military faces growing criticism over its human rights record.
In an annual report, U.S. President Bill Clinton will announce this week whether Colombia should remain on a list of countries subject to possible economic sanctions because of their perceived failure to fight drugs hard enough.
If Colombia is decertified again diplomats say the move will be directed more at President Ernesto Samper and his allegedly drug-financed election than at Colombia's police and military -- the natural U.S. allies on the frontlines of the drug war. And with or without certification, American counternarcotics aid will not be affected, U.S. officials say.
Gelbard's department has already doubled anti-drug funding for Colombia to $44 million for 1997 and another $37.5 million has been allocated from a separate discretionary fund. In addition Washington has pledged a multimillion-dollar package of material aid including upgraded cropduster aircraft and 24 UH-1 helicopters to spearhead the next phase of the drug war.
Some experts compare the situation in Colombia to Vietnam in the 1960s when the United States became progressively bogged down in a faraway conflict as it shifted from covert involvement to frontline operations.
"To insert the U.S. into this kind of complex conflict is like putting the U.S. into Vietnam. If the U.S. provides aid for the drug war then it is essentially for counterinsurgency purposes too," Florida-based analyst Eduardo Gamarra said.
U.S. officials refuse to say how many advisers and agents are now working in Colombia and are coy about revealing the exact nature of their involvement. But a Western diplomat said 44 U.S. military were stationed at one of three ground-based radar stations manned by U.S. personnel carrying out "essentially frontline intelligence gathering and monitoring."
It is also known that U.S. spy-in-the-sky satellites chart the spread of illicit coca leaf or opium poppy plantations and that shadowy U.S. reconnaissance planes buzz suspicious light aircraft in Colombian airspace. Just last month the first U.S. pilot died in action when his plane crashed during a crop eradication mission over guerrilla-infested jungles.
Bogota-based political analyst Juan Tokatlian believes the prospects of successful U.S. intervention in the drug war are bleak. "The idea of Vietnam creates the idea of a single territory and a single combat. This is much more complex since the drug war is being waged throughout the region. It could be much more dramatic in its effects in the long term than Vietnam," he said.

Colombia's state employees launched a nationwide strike on Tuesday and immediately drew support from the country's leftist rebels, who vowed to back workers' demands for higher pay with armed force.
Union bosses said the indefinite work stoppage -- billed as the biggest in 20 years -- had won the "total" support of an estimated 800,000 public sector employees and severely disrupted the nation's airports, telecommunications, oil production, government administration and all but emergency health services.
Government officials and spokesmen for the state oil company Ecopetrol played down the economic impact of the strike but admitted concern over threatened rebel attacks coinciding with the labour action.
"The strike is total. Workers have observed the call en masse and some social sectors are also joining in," said Hernando Hernandez, head of the oil workers' union USO, known for its combative, fiercely nationalistic stance.
"So far everything is passing off in a peaceful fashion. There are no reports of violence," he added.
Though Hernandez said Ecopetrol had been severely affected by the strike, a senior company official told Reuters there was no effect whatsoever. Administrative employees were filling in for union workers, as part of a strike contingency plan, and production and pumping operations were proceeding normally, the official said.
State workers called the strike to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike. The government, which is struggling to slash its burgeoning fiscal deficit, vowed to hold workers' to a weighted 13.5 percent increase. The strike began at midnight Monday (0500 GMT on Tuesday) and is to last indefinitely.
A communique issued by National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, just hours after the strike began, underscored what authorities had already described as the threat of imminent rebel attacks.
"We support our union comrades. But simply making demands (through a strike) is not sufficient," the communique said. "These actions must go hand in hand with effective pressure tactics and expressions of violence and grassroots disobedience as the only method to resolve the real problems of the nation."
It said its backing of the strike was a preamble to what it termed a "national armed strike." In the past, the ELN has used so-called "armed strikes" to shut down vast regions of the country, blockading major highways, setting fire to vehicles and threatening people who show up for work.
The ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in the mid-1960s, specialises in economic sabotage and attacks on multinational companies.
Even before the ELN communique was made public, tight security was clamped on the capital of Bogota, where a ban on alcohol was declared late on Monday by Mayor Antanas Mockus and a lack of public transportation prevented thousands of people from getting to work on Tuesday morning.
State-run schools and universities across the country were shut down by the government as a security measure.
Heavy detachments of riot police and army troops stood guard outside public offices in the downtown area, and police helicopters hovered over Plaza de Bolivar, the city's main square, where an estimated 20,000 strikers gathered to protest outside Congress on Tuesday afternoon.
Francisco Hernandez, a spokesman for Bogota's El Dorado international airport, said operations were "more or less normal" early on Tuesday. Some carriers, including Continental and American Airlines, suspended all operations in and out of Colombia since airport firemen had threatened to disrupt operations.
A spokesman for the National Exporters Association said vast shipments of cut flowers to the United States, in preparation for this week's St. Valentine's Day holiday, had not been affected because they were flown out of Colombia on domestic carriers.

Throngs of people flocked on Wednesday to a trade fare unveiling the latest personal security gadgets in a country where kidnapping and drug gangs are rampant.
The entry fee for the two-day Expo Seguridad fair was $285. But there was no shortage of takers in Colombia, which has the highest kidnap rate in the world, three guerrilla forces specialising in extortion and attacks on multinationals and drug gangs armed to the teeth.
Industrialists, government officials, defence experts and the worried wealthy were among those who descended on a downtown Bogota convention centre for the thrill of meeting shadowy people like an ex-spy from Israel offering the Sting-2, a $7 million dollar, remote-controlled plane able to start a one-man war or just monitor traffic.
Many hi-tech security gadgets like the Sting-2 are so secret that they are only be sold to hand-picked clients.
William Silva, a saleman with A1A Security, a Colombian firm headquartered in Miami, was offering a $600 wristwatch that is really a camera, or a video camera so small that it can be concealed in the end of a neck tie.
"My speciality is espionage and counter-espionage. I have given advice and provided equipment for the Colombian army and the security services," Silva said. "I look on myself as a Colombian James Bond or a character from Mission Impossible."
Another popular service for those with a bunker mentality is armour-plating. The price tag for fitting a Range Rover with sophisticated alloys, tough enough to resist a bazooka, missile or bomb attack, was around $150,000.
"Colombia is certainly the market leader in Latin America and probably in the world for sales of armour-plated vehicles. There's such a huge problem of terrorism against the government and of kidnap by the guerrilla," Silva said.
For those more interested in surrounding themselves with a human shield rather than a ring of steel, Luis Enrique La Rotta, director of Sicurex, boasted he can provide bodyguards trained in methods learned from the Chinese, Incas and Aztecs.
"Becoming a bodyguard is like entering a religion. Once you're in you must keep practicing the faith," he said. "We don't want Rambos, our escorts are intelligent, intuitive and astute. They smell danger but don't look for a fight. They only use guns as a last resort."
The Israeli connection at the fair is strong. One company is offering two-week training sessions in the Middle East. Another specialist Benny Manel, a former adviser to the Israeli government, gives a conference on industrial espionage and sabotage.

A fresh wave of political violence swept across Colombia leaving at least 24 people dead and dozens injured in massacres and guerrilla raids within a 48-hour period, authorities said on Monday.
One of the bloodiest incidents occurred in the notoriously violent northwest banana-growing region of Uraba, where suspected leftist guerrillas massacred nine civilians late on Sunday in what a local police chief called "acts of desperation."
Marxist rebels also launched bloody attacks in central Cundinamarca and eastern Meta provinces in what army commanders said was a bid to relieve pressure on other fronts, particularly a "strategic corridor" from the eastern plains to the capital.
"This massacre was a terrorist act. The guerrillas are carrying out these acts of desperation because they know they haven't got the support of the local community," Uraba police chief Col. Anatolio Correa told Reuters.
He said a 20-strong gang of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels stormed into Currulao, near the port of Turbo on the Gulf of Uraba, and opened fire on villagers on the main street, in an ice-cream parlour and in a bar.
The dead included a 14-year-old student, a local funeral parlour owner, a butcher and peasant farmers. Six people were wounded. Two weeks ago a massive car bomb ripped through nearby Apartado, killing 11 people and injuring more than 50 in an attack that also was blamed on FARC guerrillas.
Rebels and right-wing paramilitaries have killed with impunity in Uraba for a decade. Some political analysts attribute the violence to a struggle for control of lucrative arms and drug smuggling routes, while others say it surged after right-wing death squads and the military struck a covert pact to drive rebels and leftist sympathisers out of the area.
Heavy fighting flared earlier on Sunday around the town of Uribe in Meta, formerly the site of the FARC's national headquarters. Five soldiers were killed and 12 wounded in a day-long battle. In Puerto Gaitan in the same province, two soldiers were killed in separate clashes with the FARC.
The fighting in Meta was preceded by two guerrilla raids on Saturday night on the mountain towns of Une, 15 miles (25 km) south of Bogota, and Gutierrez, 25 miles (40 km) from the capital. One policeman died in Gutierrez as more than 200 FARC fighters stormed the town.
"There was heavy fog but I could see the guerrillas running all through the town," said parish priest Victor Moreno. "One even climbed into the bell tower of the church to fire at the police post."
"These attacks are part of a tactic to get publicity and to relieve pressure on other fronts," regional army commander Gen. Euclides Sanchez told Reuters. The army has been carrying out operations in the area since 16 soldiers were killed in five days of fighting in San Juanito, Meta, in February.
Unidentified gunmen killed four people in San Pedro de los Milagros, in Antioquia province, late on Sunday, and a bomb exploded early on Monday in Monteria, the capital of Cordoba province, injuring five people, police said.
Three soldiers died over the weekend when National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels ambushed a light tank near the town of Saravena in northeast Arauca province.
Government estimates put the combined strength of the FARC and ELN at about 12,000, but analysts say the real figure may be much higher. The FARC was formed as a pro-Soviet guerrilla force in 1964 while the Cuban-inspired ELN was set up shortly afterward by radical Roman Catholic priests.

Union leaders restarted talks with government ministers on Thursday morning in a bid to end a strike by public sector workers, now in its third day.
Interior Minister Horacio Serpa said he hoped for "serene and sincere" negotiations but admitted the government, battling to rein in a burgeoning fiscal deficit, did not have much room for manoeuvre.
Union representatives expressed mild optimism but insisted the strike by an estimated 800,000 state workers would not be lifted until there was firm agreement on demands, including a 21.5 percent pay hike and an end to the planned privatisation of regional and national industries.
"We hope these talks will be serene and sincere. We will look into workers' demands in the broadest and most generous form but they must understand we have problems," Serpa tolds reporters.
The last round of negotiations broke up without agreement last Sunday when the government stuck to its original weighted 13.5 percent pay offer and refused to budge on privatisation plans.
Hernando Hernandez, leader of the main oil workers' union known for its combative and fiercely nationalistic stance, feared there was little chance of a rapid breakthrough.
Unitary Workers' Confederation leader, Luis Eduardo Garzon, meanwhiile, said state workers may bend on some of their demands if the government was prepared to compromise.
"I think there's a positive atmosphere. We're ready to look for alternatives if the government is prepared to do the same," he said.
There have been conflicting reports on the impact of the industrial action. President Ernesto Samper said just 10 percent of state workers had heeded the strike call while unions said they had severely disrupted key economic and social sectors, including oil, telecommunications, education and all but emergency health care and long-distance road freight.
In parallel with talks, unions are scheduled to stage the biggest protest marches of the strike so far in Colombia's five largest cities.
A demonstration on Tuesday ended in running battles between riot police and a 200-strong group of protesters hurling bricks and bottles.
About 40 buses bringing demonstrators from Colombia's eastern plains region to the capital were detained early on Tuesday morning at a military roadblock near Villavicencio, about 60 miles (100 km) east of Bogota. An army spokesman said the convoy was later allowed to continue.
The spokesman said a strong security presence would be maintained throughout the country as long as the labour action lasted.
Despite threats from National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels and government warnings that leftist guerrillas were trying to infiltrate the strike movement, no serious violence has been reported since the start of the work stoppage at midnight on Monday.

A former justice minister said on Monday that Colombia's moves to lift a six-year extradition ban were a smokescreen designed to appease the United States while protecting the country's drug barons.
"This government has no real desire to push extradition through but it wants to give the impression that it does ... We must not underestimate (President Ernesto) Samper's bad faith and capacity for trickery," former justice minister Enrique Parejo told Reuters.
Samper reiterated on Monday his commitment to seeing an end to the constitutional ban on sending Colombians to stand trial abroad, saying "it forms part of our policies in the international struggle against drugs".
But Parejo believes Samper is merely paying lip service to the idea of extradition to placate the United States, which blacklisted Colombia for a second consecutive year for its perceived failure to crack down on drug trafficking.
A Senate committee is due to re-open a government- sponsored debate on extradition on Tuesday following a confusing session last week, which ended in a hung vote and left legislators and ministers arguing over congressional rules.
Even if one of three extradition proposals due for debate clears all congressional hurdles and makes it onto the statute books, Parejo believes it would be so complex as to be unworkable.
The alternatives range from the simple abrogation of Article 35 from the constitution -- the one banning extradition of Colombian nationals -- to one that includes widespread restrictions on when extradition could be applied.
"This is all part of a manoeuvre by the government. Even if some form of extradition is passed then it will really amount to nothing because there will be so many regulations that these would frustrate the whole process," Parejo said.
Extradition was banned in 1991 after Pablo Escobar, the late head of the notorious Medellin drug cartel, launched a spate of bombings and kidnappings against the state.
When Samper took office in August 1994, amid allegations that he financed his election campaign with donations from the Cali drug mob, he said restoration of extradition was not on his political agenda.
Samper and his top ministers have reversed that position in the face of increasing pressure from the United States, which has consistently pressed for extradition of the jailed Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, former chiefs of the notorious Cali cartel.
But Parejo believes Samper is now giving verbal backing to the restoration of extradition safe in the knowledge that Colombian law makes it virtually impossible to apply new legislation retroactively.

Colombian union leaders representing 800,000 state workers launched a nationwide strike on Tuesday but its impact on vital economic sectors was not immediately clear apart from disruption in public transport.
Labor leaders said the strike of 800,000 public sector workers, which could be the biggest in Colombia since September 1977, would disrupt air traffic, oil production, telecommunications and all non-emergency health services.  
But early morning reports on national radio said, that apart from dire shortages of public transportation, everything appeared to be running at or close to normal.
Apart from the pre-dawn torching of a bus outside the central city of Ibague there were no immediate reports of violence or serious acts of vandalism by "the dark forces of chaos" that President Ernesto Samper warned of in a national television and radio address on Monday night.  
Ismael Enrique Arenas, a senior official with the state oil company Ecopetrol, said there was no immediate effect on exploration or production activity since administrative employeees were filling in for union workers joining in the work stoppage.
Private oil companies working under association contracts with Ecopetrol were also unaffected, he told Reuters.
Francisco Hernandez, a spokesman for Bogota's El Dorado international airport, said operations were "more or less normal" early Tuesday. "I only hope we'll be able to say the same by this evening,"  he told Caracol news radio.  
Some carriers, including Continental Airlines Inc and AMR Corp's American Airlines, suspended all operations in and out of Colombia as a security precaution since firemen had threatened to disrupt operations at the airport. But Hernandez said most airlines were operating normally.
State workers called the strike, which began at midnight local time/0500 GMT Tuesday and is to last indefinitely, to press for a 21.5 percent wage hike.
The government, which is struggling to slash its burgeoning fiscal deficit, has vowed to hold workers' to a weighted 13.5 percent increase.  
Bogota police chief General Teodoro Campo stressed "absolute normalcy" in the capital in an interview with national radio.
But the city's streets, which were free of traffic, looked more like they do on a quiet Sunday afternoon than they do on a normal traffic-choked weekday. Buses were especially scarce.
Police helicopters clattered over the north end of Bogota, apparently on the lookout for urban rebel commandos, and a column of four light tanks and two armoured personnel carriers was spotted by a Reuter television cameraman heading for the southern gateway to the capital.  
Army officer Lieutenant Pedro Jimenez, in charge of the column, said he was under strict orders to prevent any strike-related violence.
"The aim of this operation is to prevent the outbreak of violence. We will ensure that this strike proceeds in a climate of complete calm," he said.
"All commanders have been given orders to make sure that there are no attempts to commit terrorist acts by subversive groups," said armed forces chief Gen. Harold Bedoya.  
Heavy detachments of riot police and army troops stood guard outside public offices in the city center -- where workers were to stage protest marches late Tuesday -- and police manned checkpoints along key roads in the capital.
All state-run universities and schools were closed and long lines of people could be seen stranded at bus stops in working- class districts on the south end of the capital.
"There's very little transportation this morning," said a woman waiting for a bus in the suburb of Soacha to take her to a cleaning job in the north end of the city.
"I've been waiting here for 1-1/2 hours and I'm afraid i'll lose my job over this. The bosses just don't understand," she said.
Elizabeth Fuentes, a union leader manning a picket line outside a Bogota adminsitrative building, said the strike would last indefinitely -- until the government bowed to demands for the 21.5 percent wage hike and cancelled plans for the privatization of national and regional industries.
"This strike is a protest against Samper's economic policy," she told Reuters. "Those policies are anti-popular, they're policies against workers and against the Colombian people."

Oil giant British Petroleum Co Plc is involved in a "conspiracy of silence" over human rights abuses in eastern Colombia, European legislator Richard Howitt alleged on Friday.
But the British Labor Party representative to the Euro- Parliament admitted, after a week-long fact-finding mission to the country, that he had no evidence directly linking the multinational to the deaths of social leaders in Casanare province close to BP's operations.
BP's Colombian subsidiary, British Petroleum Exploration (BPX), has consistently denied charges of links to rights abuses committed by right-wing paramilitaries and the army. In a statement issued on Friday, it "energetically" condemned all violations carried out against civic leaders in the area.
"BP is involved in a conspiracy of silence and should take a more active stance in favor of human rights ... it may be that BP staff have a direct liability in these actions or it may not be the case," Howitt, a member of the Euro-Parliament South American affairs delegation, told a news conference.
"But I find it impossible to believe that BP managers are not aware of these human rights abuses committed in their name if not by them directly," he added.
The claims against BP were fueled by a series of articles in the British press in the last year based on a multi-agency report drawn up in 1995. That report documented the murders of seven peasant or social leaders, most of whom had protested against BP's operations in the area since they began in 1991.
BP is not mentioned by name in the report's conclusions, and the killings were attributed to paramilitaries and the army.
A statement issued by BP Thursday said: "BP rejects energetically human rights abuses from whatever quarter and has publicly condemned the deaths of civic leaders and others in Casanare."
"BP categorically rejects the accusations made by Howitt. He has a great responsibility to make sure that these claims are fully founded," it added.
BPX head John Doust asked Colombia's Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso to investigate the claims fully to show it had nothing to hide. Valdivieso opened an inquiry last month but told Doust in a letter that he had no grounds to suspect any wrongdoing by the British company.
Howitt also accused BP of failing to spend enough on the local community in Casanare. BP figures show it spent more than $17 million between 1991 and 1996 on social, education, education, environmental and infrastructure programs.

Hundreds more families are continuing to flee violence through the jungles of northwest Colombia, adding to a burgeoning refugee crisis in the town of Mutata, its mayor said on Tuesday.
At least 2,500 people arrived in a village close to Mutata in the violence-torn Uraba region over Easter, and Mayor Luis Renteria said another 1,500 mostly women and children were expected to arrive in the next few days.
In the first international response to the drama, a British embassy official said on Tuesday that Britain's Overseas Development Agency had approved an $80,000 emergency aid package of tents and food supplies, due to be sent to the region before the weekend.
The army has accused Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas of ordering the peasants to abandon their homes in the Rio Salaqui basin of neighbouring Choco province in order to create "social disorder" in the main towns of Uraba.
But a FARC spokeswoman said the people had fled in the face of "indiscriminate" aerial bombardments by the army and threats from right-wing paramilitary groups.
"These people say they will not return home until they have guarantees from the government that paramilitary groups will be forced out of their communities," Renteria said.
He said one-third of the refugees in Pavarando, in the municipality of Mutata, were children, and that more than 80 women who spent up to four weeks walking from their homes along treacherous jungle tracks were pregnant.
A British embassy official said tents and food would be purchased locally and channelled to the refugees via the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The human tide of refugees has drawn an angry response from army commander Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett, who said: "The guerrilla strategy is to force these people to move out and occupy towns to create a huge social problem."
But a FARC spokeswoman told Reuters: "We have been in contact with our people in the area and they say there has been intense fighting with the army. Because the army has not been able to wipe out the guerrilla it has staged indiscriminate aerial bombardments of the area."
Interior Minister Horacio Serpa and provincial governor Alvaro Uribe are scheduled to visit the refugees in Mutata on Wednesday.
Uraba, which covers parts of Choco, Antioquia and Cordoba provinces, is the scene of bitter conflict between the army and the guerrillas. The army says it is a key arms and drug smuggling route for the rebels, while the guerrillas say right-wing forces are trying to force peasants out of the strategically important, resource-rich region close to the border with Panama.
There are an estimated 7,000 internal refugees spread across Uraba and more than 900,000 people have been displaced in the last decade by Colombia's long-running guerrilla war.

Police and military forces were recalled to barracks on Sunday and all school and university classes canceled as Colombia prepared for a threatened national strike on Tuesday that promised to be the largest in 20 years, the authorities said.
Talks between union chiefs and government ministers aimed at averting the indefinite stoppage by more than 800,000 state workers broke down in the early hours on Sunday.
Armed forces chiefs issued repeated warnings that leftist guerrillas were trying to infiltrate the strike and planning a wave of attacks to coincide with the labor action. Labor leaders said they feared the government was using the claim of rebel assaults as a pretext for a violent crackdown on striking workers.
State workers declared the strike to press for a 21.5 percent pay hike, compared to the weighted 13.5 percent government pay offer, and are protesting at what they call the whittling away of labor rights and government plans for the privatization of state-run industries.
The government issued a communique on Sunday saying: "The salary demands far exceed the government's current financial capacity ... The suspension of national and regional privatization processes would affect the improvement of efficiency of public services."
The unions began drawing up last-minute plans for the nationwide shutdown that could paralyze all but essential public services.
As part of the beefed-up security measures to curb radical protest and what they say is the possibility of Marxist rebel action, army and police began roadside checkpoints across the country and at key entry points into the capital.
"All leave has been canceled and all forces have been ordered to report to barracks. This is a grade one alert," said a Bogota police spokesman.
Education Minister Jaime Nino, meanwhile, canceled all classes for one week to "prevent any risk that could face children or teachers." As state employees, most teachers may be out on strike.
Wilson Borja, head of the main public sector union FENALTRASE, warned the tough security measures could be the prelude to a clampdown on the protest.
"Because of the arbitrary behavior of the police and the military, we believe the security forces will try and stir up trouble against the workers," he said.
The last major national strike took place in September 1977. In that strike, 20 workers were killed in a single day of violent street protests in Bogota.
Newspaper columnists drew tentative parallels on Sunday between the Colombian strike call and Ecuador's political crisis, which began with a 48-hour general strike and ended with the ouster of President Abdala Bucaram.
"I don't think anything similar to Ecuador will happen here. It would be strange that citizens who have not mobilized in two years of political crisis did so now ... but one cannot completely rule out the possibility that the union protest could be the detonator for the ill-feeling that has built up in many sectors of society," wrote Enrique Santos in Colombia's leading El Tiempo newspaper.

Regent Pacific, the Hong-Kong based fund which last month took a three percent stake in Britain's Hambros, said it was reassured by a meeting with chief executive Sir Chips Keswick that its profits would improve.
"It was useful to sit down and spend a little time with them. I left with the impression that the company's profits will improve," Julian Mayo, director of Regent Pacific Corporate Finance in London told Reuters.
A spokesman for British investment bank Hambros Plc declined to comment on the meeting but Mayo said it was "friendly, business-like and constructive."
Regent, often called a "vulture fund," received widespread attention last month when it made the Hambros buy.
Its chief Jim Mellon was widely quoted as saying the bank, one the last few British independent investment banks, was undervalued and undermanaged. He was also reported to have said the bank's shares had been "diabolical" over the last 10 years.
This attack got a cool response from Hambros, which said it would meet Regent but would not otherwise comment on its new shareholder or its intentions.
Mayo said he had gone into the meeting wanting to hear what Hambros' strategy was going forward, how the bank was planning to coninue its policy of rationalisation and restructuring and when shareholders would see the fruits of it.
Asked if he was happy with the answers he received, Mayo said "Yes, in broad terms."
But he was less clear about Regent Pacific's long term aims in buying into Hambros, which like other British merchant banks has been the subject of takeover speculation in the past.
"Our motives are to make a good return from this investment, whether it is short or long term remains to be seen," Mayo said, adding that the group liked to have good relations with a company in which it invests and this was not a one-off meeting.
"We were left with the impression that the door is always open," Mayo said.
Regent Pacific's action had, he said highlighted what a number of analysts had been saying for some time about Hambros' performance. Undervaluation of the shares and discussions with analysts had prompted the decision to buy into Hambros, he said.
He said some analysts thought the bank's shares could rise to between 300 and 325 pence, closer to its potential value.
Hambros shares closed at 260.5 pence on Tuesday, up a penny. There was speculative buying late in August after Regent Pacific's holding became public with the share price reaching a year high of 280 pence.
But talk of a takeover or a possible break-up of the bank was dismissed by analysts at the time as unlikely in the near term, although some said it had a better break-up value.
Mayo said Regent could not launch a bid for Hambros but said a greater holding in the company was "not out of the question," although it would have to notify both the bank and the stock exchange if it did buy a more significant stake.
"Whether we increase our position is something we will have to decide upon," he said.
In 1995 Hambros' pre-tax profits fell to 20.6 million pounds from 37.1 million the year before. Bad debt provisions grew to 36.2 million from 13.5 million pounds during the period.

Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's dispute with suspended star fund manager Nicola Horlick highlights a "merry-go-round" hiring system started by investment banks, banking sources said on Wednesday.
"One of the industry's failings is that it doesn't bring people up through the system. When a firm needs someone, it steals people from a competitor. This creates a destructive merry-go-round which can't be in anyone's interests," one banker said.
Newspapers said DMG suspended Horlick on Tuesday because she allegedly tried to lure colleagues at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, where she was head of UK pension fund business, to join her in a move to Dutch bank ABN AMRO.
ABN AMRO itself denied reports that the 35-year-old Horlick was poised to lure a team with her and DMG has declined to comment on the details of Horlick's suspension, except to say it centred on a potential breach of contract.
While the term "poaching" is widely used to describe the movement of teams from one firm to another, loyal colleagues following a key player to a new employer is nothing new, the banking sources said.
Most moves involve a significant salary and bonus rise and often swiftly follow payment of bonuses by the firm which an individual is leaving.
Banking sources said U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs, reported to have paid record bonuses last year, had lost a handful of staff since the payments were made.
In suspending Horlick, DMG, the investment banking arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank, has brought back into the open a subject often seen as a normal part of the rough and tumble associated with investment banking -- but which might be relatively new to the more staid world of fund management, the sources said.
"We are surprised to be mentioned in the context of poaching which would, by its nature, imply you are planning to take a whole team, which we are not," ABN AMRO chief spokesman Jules Prast told Reuters.
But he said he preferred not to discuss whether ABN AMRO had talked to or planned to talk to Horlick, who newspaper reports said had earned more than 500,000 pounds ($835,000) a year.
"She (Horlick) had certainly led a number of people in the (MGAM) division to think that she had ABN AMRO lined up," one banking source told Reuters.
But if Horlick was about to take a team of up to 20 fund managers with her to ABN AMRO, which is expanding its fund management activities in London, she might have given DMG a dose of its own medicine.
The investment bank has gained a reputation in recent years for an aggressive hiring spree aimed at top performers at other firms, which led to widespread suggestions that DMG was offering guaranteed bonuses -- some for up to two years -- to ensure that it got the staff it wanted.
This came to a head last July when DMG reached agreement with another Dutch firm, ING Barings, the investment banking division of Internationale Nederlanden Groep, over a separate poaching dispute.
ING Baring's chief executive, Hessel Lindenbergh, said at the time there was "growing resistance and irritation in the industry towards firms which deliberately poach whole teams" and that "poaching teams pushes up pay unduly".
Last year, DMG's global bonds chief Edson Mitchell said the firm had hired around 500 people since he left his previous firm Merrill Lynch. Many of the new staff came from Merrill, while others moved from the then S.G. Warburg arm of SBC Warburg. ($1=.5976 Pound)

Morgan Stanley's surprise merger with Dean Witter Discover will create a more competitive force in the European investment banking market.
"Other banks will look at this and think they have got a stronger competitor than they had before," a banking analyst at one European firm told Reuters on Wednesday.
Earlier the two U.S. firms said they had agreed to form a financial giant called Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co, with a market capitalisation of $21 billion.
Both U.S. and European investment banks have been pushing for more business in continental Europe and Britain, but analysts pointed out the merger would give Morgan Stanley's European aspirations considerable backing.
Not only would it increase the amount of capital at the firm's disposal for building its European presence, Dean Witter's U.S. retail network could also provide an additional distribution network for Morgan Stanley products.
The firms stressed there would be little overlap as a result of the merger, although they did not specify if there would be any staff cuts. A Morgan Stanley spokesman in London said he could not comment on the implications for the firm in Europe.
A Dean Witter official said it was still early days. "We've only just seen the news. It was kept extremely quiet," Graham Elliot, sales manager at Dean Witter International told Reuters.
Elliot said Dean Witter employs about 120 people in London, with around 35 working in institutional equities sales. This business was, he said, consistently profitable and had been expanding. "We talk to over 300 institutions," he said.
The firm already has significant placing power and its European business is extremely focused, he added.
Dean Witter, founded in 1924, has a presence on London futures and options exchange LIFFE, but it was not immediately clear how its operations there would be merged.
In Eurobonds, there will be no immediately obvious gains to Morgan Stanley. It has led 16 international bond issues deals worth $2.5 billion this year, putting it in 14th place in the league table compiled by Capital DATA Bondware.
Dean Witter is not active in the Eurobond market, while in 1996 Morgan Stanley ranked fifth in the league table.
Banking sources said the merger would be largely complementary in London, adding that the firms would have to search fairly hard to find room for cutting staff.
"But they don't usually look to take people on in this sort of situation," one said.
Morgan Stanley, founded in 1935, employs around 2,000 people in its Canary Wharf headquarters in the docklands area in east London and has just over 2,500 employees in Europe as a whole. Dean Witter's London offices are in the Broadgate development to the north of London's financial heartland.
Some said there could be a fall-out of key personnel if there was a significant change in corporate culture or a management restructuring of the European operation.
But the idea of a merger is not new to Morgan Stanley, which in 1994 engaged in unsuccessful talks with British merchant bank S.G. Warburg. Warburgs was later bought by Swiss Bank Corp.
A joint statement by Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter detailed the new senior management structure but gave no indication of the position of Morgan Stanley's executive chairman in Europe Sir David Walker or other senior European personnel.
Morgan Stanley insiders in London said the first they had heard of the merger was an address by Richard Fisher, the firm's chairman, over the internal communications system.

A threatened overhaul of Britain's Securities and Investments Board (SIB) by a future Labour government and news it must find a new chairman will make the next few months uncertain for the top financial watchdog.
The opposition Labour Party has said that if it wins power in elections this year it would streamline London's regulatory bodies, giving the SIB greater responsibility.
But insiders at the SIB, which was set up in 1985 and is charged with ensuring regulatory system works efficiently, said on Friday it was business as usual at the watchdog.
While surprised by chairman Sir Andrew Large's decision on Thursday to give up his post at the end of May, industry sources said they believed his successor would not necessarily be plucked from the ranks of Britain's frontline regulators.
"They will not only have to have the intellect and leadership qualities, but also the gravitas and authority that must accompany the role," one told Reuters.
The SIB supervises the so-called "frontline" regulators which independently authorise firms to conduct investment business in Britain. These self-regulating organisations also monitor firms, handle complaints and punish rule-breakers.
Large said the bulk of the changes he had been charged with overseeing had been completed but pointed out that the main unfinished business was the unsatisfactory rate of progress on a a long-running review of pensions mis-selling.
This saga is likely to bedevil whoever takes over from Large as insurance companies seek to resolve outstanding pensions cases.
Newspapers said the job might go to Phillip Thorpe at the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO), Colette Bowe of the Personal Investment Authority (PIA) or former Securities and Futures Authority head Christopher Sharples.
"It (the job) has not gone to professional regulators before," the first source said.
Given the prospect of a new government, and possibly a new ruling political party, regulatory sources agree the appointment of 54-year-old Large's successor will be particularly significant.
The ruling Conservative Party must call an election by May 22 and opinion polls suggest a Labour victory may be the likely outcome.
A new SIB chairman may be named before the election but he or she will take over the reins in early June.
The choice of a new chairman is made jointly by the Treasury and the head of the Bank of England, but because of the timing of the appointment, the Labour party is also expected to be canvassed for its views on the individuals to be short-listed.
But the Treasury declined to comment on any of the names mentioned or how exactly the vacancy would be filled. "We are not detailing the procedure but at this stage no one is ruled in and no one is ruled out," a Treasury spokesman said.
A factor which could limit those wanting to be considered for the role is money, especially when compared with the sort of salaries paid in the private sector.
While top-quality bankers or financiers can expect large pay packets, the money on offer for the SIB job is expected to be relatively little by comparison. During the year 1995-96, Large was paid just over 175,000 pounds.
"The money could turn out to be the sticking point," one regulatory source said, adding that the selectors would not rush to find a replacement for Large. "Its a big job and its important to get the right person," he said.

A proposed reform of Britain's state pensions system would revolutionise the financial services industry, market participants said on Thursday.
The ruling Conservative government on Wednesday unveiled proposals which aim to prevent huge burdens falling on future taxpayers by making workers take responsibility for providing for their old age.
Roger Taylor, deputy chairman of composite insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, described the plans as "the biggest shift in financial services in the last 50 years".
Taylor said it would encourage other governments to follow suit, adding that if the proposals were enacted they would start to generate additional business in three to four years time.
"For the industry as a whole it is good news," Tony Baker, deputy director general of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), told Reuters.
Prime Minister John Major must call an election by May and the opposition Labour Party is well ahead in the opinion polls.
Labour wants to retain the basic state pension and develop a new range of second pensions for those not already in occupational pension schemes.
But the banking and life insurance industry is gearing up for change whatever the outcome of the election, arguing that demographic changes mean additional pension provisions are essential for economic and social stability beyond 2000.
Banking analyst John Leonard of U.S. investment bank Salomon Brothers agreed that the British government's decision to address the problem was an opportunity for the industry.
"Anything giving rise to privately managed assets must introduce interesting products for banks and the insurance sector," he said.
He said a large additional pool of privately managed money to fund the pensions was a particularly big opportunity for the "large volume, efficiently managed providers with good distribution networks."
But the shift from state to privately held pensions could also spawn a major marketing war between the firms most likely to win business.
This in itself would be costly, at least at the outset. The start of any such scheme would be particularly important as once individuals had chosen a provider with which to invest their pension contributions, it would be difficult for other companies to persuade them to move.
Baker said there would still be plenty of business for existing players in the market which were not able to sell the new scheme, labelled Basic Pension Plus.
He said there would have to be regulations governing matters such as maximum charges, transferability, reporting and investment returns, while not all insurance companies would necessarily be included on the approved list of providers.
While the desirability of involvement for companies would depend on the rules set out by the government, Baker said the scheme could lead to further consolidation in the industry, where only the big, efficient providers could meet the criteria.
He said the scheme could hit smaller players and other elements of the industry, particularly independent financial advisors (IFAs), who could lose out if individuals chose to top up basic contributions with their main pensions provider rather than other companies.
"The need for a middle man might be much less than at the present time," he said.
Baker added that the government had underlined that it wanted simplicity and lower costs to result from the changes, factors which he said would mean individuals "buying" their pensions rather than being sold them.
The importance of the move was underlined by Royal &amp; Sun Alliance's Taylor, who said self-provision would become the biggest single transaction an individual would make.
Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Britain's Halifax Building Society, said earlier this week that the group would target long-term savings products -- life assurance, pensions and investments -- because of their growth potential.
"With an ageing population and governments unable to look after people as they have historically been able to do in retirement, the requirement on the private individual to provide for the long-term future will be accentuated," Blackburn said.

British property group Hammerson Plc's chief executive Ron Spinney said on Monday he expected the British market to perform well over the next two years.
"I think the market will perform well over the next two years," Spinney told Reuters.
Earlier the group announced a 21.3 percent rise in pre-tax profit for 1996 to 70.0 million stg from 1995's 57.7 million stg. Net asset value (NAV) per share rose 3.2 percent to 388 pence from 376 pence.  
Spinney said Hammerson had had "another good year", including turning over 15 percent of the portfolio, investing 50 million stg on improving existing properties and embarking on an 800 million stg development programme.
He said the group would be spending around 115 million stg on its existing portfolio and its developments.
"We have taken steps to ensure growth in the future...The UK market for shopping centres and offices is bouyant," he added.  
Spinney said there were signs the French market was in a similar position to where the British market had been about two years before, adding he was confident there had been rises in values since the end of the year in Britain.
Hammerson's gearing is currently "relatively modest" at 58 percent, Spinney said, adding that the group itended acquiring more properties over the year, this would be split between areas and sectors.
"We are generally happy with it (the split) as it is at the present time," he said.

British hotels and betting group Ladbroke Group Plc announced on Tuesday the closure of its property arm and sale of its remaining properties to allow it to concentrate on core areas.
"The closure of the property division will allow us to focus upon our core businesses of hotels and betting and gaming," said Brian Wallace, Ladbroke's group finance director.
Ladbroke said the cost of the closure would be 52.3 million pounds ($84.4 million) and would mainly cover losses arising on the sale of property and a provision "to write down the remaining portfolio to net realisable value upon an accelerated sale".
The firm said its 1996 accounts, due to be released on Thursday, would also include a non-operating exceptional charge of 17.6 million pounds "mainly representing losses on disposals of investment properties previously announced during 1996".
Analysts said that although the cost was larger than expected, the closure and property sales removed one element of uncertainty for the group during 1997.
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson's Greg Freehely said in a research note that Ladbroke's 1996 results would now include exceptional items totalling more than 100 million pounds, including property disposals and closure of the division.
The investment bank said other exceptional items were the settlement of a rent dispute at the Paris Hilton and a settlement to cover an adjustment on the price of DIY retailer Texas Homecare which Ladbroke sold to J. Sainsbury Plc two years ago.
Ladbroke is expected to report a profit rise of around 30 percent for 1996, with analysts forecasting pre-tax, pre-exceptional profits in the 155-165 million pound range, against 121.3 million pounds a year ago. Net dividend is forecast at between 6.0 and 6.2 pence per share, compared with 6.0 pence.
Freehely said the discount on the sale of properties to Britain's Minerva Plc for 25 million pounds was larger than anticipated. But he adde that "the decision to provide for the closure of the division and take further write downs is the correct one...".
The portfolio of around 10 commercial and residential properties sold to Minerva had a book value of about 34.6 million pounds and were mostly in London and southern England.
Ladbroke said its property arm had also sold a stake in a Boston office building to HN Gorin Inc for $23.0 million in cash, about equal to book value.
It also expects to make a further U.S. property disposal this week for about $13 million and use the proceeds from the sales to pay down debt.
Ladbroke said the net book value of commercial property at January 1, 1996 was 373.4 million pounds. A property analyst at one British firm said it was no great surprise that Ladbroke had finally withdrawn from the property market as it had not performed in this sector for some time.
"They used to be good at what they did in property, but they rather lost their way," he said. "They are retrenching into

Investment banking giant Merrill Lynch on Wednesday took another step in building up its presence in the European equities markets with the purchase of an equities research and sales boutique in Italy.
The U.S. powerhouse's takeover of the Milan-based Carnegie Italia SpA follows a similar but larger move earlier this year in Spain when it bought FG Inversiones, the country's largest independent brokerage, for 3.7 billion pesetas ($29.5 million).
Merrill, which last year bought British equities specialist Smith New Court, said in a statement that the head of Carnegie Italia's team Tony Morrongiello would "spearhead Merrill Lynch's local institutional equity sales presence in Milan".
This would be in partnership with Merrill's existing Italian equity sales, research and trading teams in London, it added.
Paul Roy, Merril's head of equity sales and trading in Europe, said the move would give the firm "tremendous leverage in this important market" and enable better client service.
"We will also be better placed to offer strategic advice to Italian companies on local and international equity markets," Roy said in a statement.
The chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe, Christopher Reeves, said Italy had been identified as a growth area for the firm in equities, debt markets, private and investment banking.
Swedish stockbroker Carnegie said it had agreed to sell Merrill its Italian operations because it needed capital to expand in the Nordic region. It recently sold its operations in Spain and said it would also pull out of Portugal.
Neither party disclosed what Merrill would pay for the Italian operation, although given the small size of the operation the amount was not believed to be large.
Along with other investment banks, Merrill has until now "parachuted" relevant people in from London and New York when it has needed to wrap-up investment banking deals in European countries where it does not have an equity broking presence.
Analysts said that buying small firms in Europe and building local bases rather than employing a top-down approach from one core centre underlined the need for local relationships, particularly in areas such as corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings (IPOs).

A British firm believes it has developed a computer programme which could prevent other financial firms getting into the sort of situation Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) is currently trying to resolve.
Numerous risk management systems already exist, but Frasin Limited says its Windows-based SOFWIN is the first to address operational risk management rather than financial risk.
"We believe it will prompt senior management to ask the right questions, which will create a more disciplined and controlled environment," Frasin's chief executive Philip Martin told Reuters on Tuesday.
MGAM is attempting to unscramble a complicated web of investments in three of its funds. These led to the funds being temporarily suspended last week after it revealed "suspected irregularities" in the them.
A fund manager for two of the funds was suspended at the same time and had his assets frozen by a High Court injunction.
Ironically, Martin says he took the product to show Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank, some months ago with a view to selling it to them.
He says he will still offer it to the firm, freely admitting that his prospects may have been boosted by publicity surrounding MGAM and a recent fine for fund management firms in the Robert Fleming group over so-called "rat-trading" by a fund manager in a Hong Kong joint venture with Jardine Matheson.
"I have to thank Morgan Grenfell and Jardine Fleming because their timing has been impeccable," he says with a grin.
Martin believes the software could also help banks avoid another Barings situation, where so-called "rogue trader" Nick Leeson, was able to run both the front and back offices, effectively monitoring his own trading.
Leeson is currently serving a long jail sentence in Singapore for fraudulent trading which led to losses of around $1.4 billion and culminated in the blue-blooded bank's collapse.
While Martin admits it will never be possible to eradicate rogue individuals, he says closer monitoring by senior management of all an institution's operations is essential.
If a chief executive, chief financial officer or other top official wants to avoid criticism in the event of a problem within the firm, then a programme such as that offered by Frasin, which is part of the HSBC group, should ensure they have adopted every measure possible to avoid such events.
SOFWIN, which costs 12,000 pounds ($18,640) a year and must be signed up to for three years, takes the institution through a detailed questionnaire, with a possible 3,600 different questions.
The collated results, after any subsidiaries or branches have also been through the process, then gives a clear picture of where any potential weaknesses lie, Martin said. It can also compare the standards of different branches and how they each match up with an "ideal" set-up.
Much of the programme is devoted to dealing activities, as this has been found to be a major area of concern.
"The largest part revolves around dealing activities. I have spoken to senior managers who are scared to death about what their traders are up to," he added.
But however thorough the programme, Martin says the buck stops with senior management and they are the main target of his marketing.
"It takes commitment by senior management. If they are not committed to it (assessing the company's organisational risk), then it's a waste of time. But they are opening themselves up to criticism," he said. ($1=.6436 Pound)

Kyriacos Papouis, the trader allegedly linked to NatWest Markets' 50 million pound ($80 million) options loss, has resigned from U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns.
"We have accepted the resignation of Kyriacos Papouis, an interest rate trader in our derivatives department," a Bear Stearns spokeswoman told Reuters.
"We have conducted a thorough review of his open trading positions and are satisfied that they are all booked and valued properly. We have notified the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) of his resignation," she added.
The spokeswoman declined to give any further details of Papouis' resignation.
Earlier this week, Bear Stearns said Papouis was "on leave, pending further information".
Papouis could not be contacted for comment on Friday.
Papouis left NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Britain's National Westminster Bank, late last year and moved to Bear Stearns.
Last week NatWest disclosed mispricing errors in its interest rate options book and said it had suspended a senior trader, named by banking sources as Neil Dodgson, for alleged "failure to supervise". It also reported a former options trader, allegedly Papouis, to financial markets watchdog the SFA.
Options are contracts which give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security at a set price on a set date in the future.
The SFA said it had been notified of the NatWest probe into the loss and had opened a file while the Bank of England has said it is cooperating with the SFA.
The episode was especially embarrassing to NatWest coming only days after it announced its 1996 results.
On Thursday, a senior NatWest Markets official said that compared with the size of losses run up from derivatives trading at some other banks, it had got off relatively lightly.
"If that is all it costs us to learn the value of a tight infrastructure, then it could turn out to be a blessing in disguise," Nick Riley was reported by Britain's Press Association agency as saying.
Riley is administrative officer for NatWest Markets' global foreign exchange business. His comments were made during a conversation at a charitable function on Thursday night, banking sources said.
The PA said Riley had pointed out that other banks such as Barings, which crashed in 1995 owing around $1.4 billion as a result of losses run up by Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson, paid far more to find out that their internal controls were inadequate.
But a NatWest spokeswoman distanced the firm from Riley's comments.
"He is not a spokesman for NatWest and his comments are not therefore attributable to the company. This was a personal view," she told Reuters.

Heavy April rains in Ivorian cocoa areas have favoured mid-crop (May-Sept) pod growth and flowering for early 1997/98 main crop (Oct-April) harvests, weather and crop analyts said on Thursday.
"At the end of March we were at 109 percent of the 10-year average (Jan-Mar) in all but a few areas," said one crop analyst. "I would say April has been about average but the last 10 days will give the overall picture."
National weather centre forecasters said coastal and inland areas, particularly around Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, had received well above average levels in the first 20 days of April. "If rains are heavy for the last 10 days of April you can say the (long) rainy season has begun (usually lasting until August)."
Many crop analysts use private data from undisclosed areas but official weather data for the first 20 days of April showed rains at 10 weather stations averaged 78.85 mm. A total of 95 mm fell in the first 10 days of April and 693.5 in the second.
One crop analyst put overall 1997 rainfall at just below average. Another said rains had risen to 145 mm against his 10-year average figure of 134 mm for 12 stations. Rains in some areas had been between 35-145 percent above normal.
"March and April have been good and recent rains also seem quite heavy," said one. "April could be close to its average."
March rains averaged 111 mm, against crop analysts' long-term averages ranging from 80-90 mm. February rains of 10 mm (against a usual 50 mm average) had threatened mid crop potential until rain fell later, crop analysts said.
Young flowers for 1997/98 main crop harvests where more abundant than at the same time last year but accurate predictions of harvests would not be possible until June onwards, analysts said.
Crop analysts' estimates of the 1996/97 midcrop range between 150,000 tonnes and 200,000 tonnes but rains into May will partly determine harvests. Arrivals stood at 970-980,000 tonnes by mid April.
"Mid-crop assessments are particularly difficult. You need to visit four times as many sites for an accurate indication because of the smaller number of pods involved," one explained.
Mid-crop arrivals, with smaller bean sizes than last year's export grade harvests (up to 105 beans/100 grammes), are expected from early May -- against mid-April last year.
One set of official weather data show rainfall averages for the first three months of 1997 were 34.6, 11.3 and 100 mm respectively -- against 14.2, 50.2 and 64.9 in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 season.
The long-term averages for the same three months (1987-96) were 13.6, 37.4, 83.2. For April, the average was 130.4.
The latest April 1997 data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the first 10 days of April in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days bracketed):
Daloa 0.2 (105.8), Gagnoa 0 (142.8), San Pedro 0 (18.3), Tabou 0.4 (1.0) Man 5.4 (98.7), Dimbokro 18.3 (73.2), Yamoussoukro 22.1 (83.8), Abidjan 0 (128.8), Sassandra 0 (10.6), Adiake 33.7 (64.5), Korhogo 15.1 (14.2).
For the second 10 days of April, the rains were:
Daloa 49.3, Gagnoa 63.7, San Pedro 47.1, Tabou 57.0, Man 29.3, Dimbokro 22.2, Yamoussoukro 107.7, Abidjan 156.5, Sassandra 39.1, Adiake 69.9, Korogho 51.7.

Ivory Coast opened talks with donors on Monday on implementing reform of the cocoa and coffee sector to qualify for the final part of a loan for agricultural restructuring.
Donors said agreement on releasing the final $45 million of a $150 million loan may not be reached until 1998.
"We will mainly discuss cocoa and coffee but some questions will probably not be resolved until the end of the year," said a World Bank official attending the talks, which end on May 7.
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, has declined to release trading data to the World Bank on an export-contract auction set up last May with the help of donor funds. The Bank would like to know volumes, prices and dates of trades at the auctions but Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan has said the figures were commercially confidential.
Industry sources have complained that the auction encourages price speculation and overbidding to win export contracts. They also complain that auction contract rules on shipment dates and bid confirmation are not enforced.
Some exporters have already complained of difficulties in obtaining contracts because larger companies can bid above world market rates because of better access to finance. That threatens the viability of smaller exporters and market competition.
Exporters and the World Bank failed to agree on three proposed changes to auction rules when European Union, IMF and French development agency officials last met for talks on the system in September 1996.
Exporters, the World Bank and European industry officials subsequently proposed changes in auction rules to ensure cocoa quality. The Ivory Coast has not responded directly to those proposals.
Industry delegates are due in Ivory Coast in mid-May for follow-up talks aimed at finding a solution to concerns about the auction and quality.
Coffee sector talks have recently focused on how to liberalise marketing while maintaining adequate quality checks.
A report laying out options for Ivory Coast by British Consultant Landell Mills was expected in January but lack of guidance from Ivory Coast on which options to develop had delayed completion, said one donor.
"They are now in the process of writing it," he added, without indicating a delivery date.
The structural reforms to be funded by the loan also include the rice, sugar and cotton sectors.

A world chocolate industry group meeting Ivorian officals to discuss cocoa quality and supply will meet donors in Washington on Monday to discuss effects of market reforms on bean quality, a spokesman said Friday.
"We know that where there has been liberalisation in the past there has been a drop in quality," said a spokesman for the world industry forum OICCC (Office International du Cacao, du Chocolat et de la Confiserie).
OICCC officials would meet World Bank officials in Washington on Monday, he said.
"You must protect quality and you must protect the forward market," OICCC spokesman Tom Harrison told Ivorian Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze at a meeting with journalists after separate talks with donors and ministers on Friday.
The talks on Friday between OICCC representatives, Ivorian agriculture and commodities ministers and industry delegates, were held against a background of stricter food legislation worldwide and rising demand for quality chocolate in some countries.
World supply has also fallen or stabilised in other producer countries, including Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia, leaving chocolate manufacturers more dependent on Ivorian production.
"Legislators and consumers are putting pressure on us," said one delegate. "There are a lot of factories going up in Eastern Europe and Asia and we cannot afford hiccoughs."
Ivory Coast has closed upcountry cocoa checking stations and liberalised cocoa marketing since 1995 under the terms of a $150 million World Bank farm sector loan.
Industry buyers say cocoa bean quality has dropped as a result. Donors reject the idea and say only a complete liberalisation of marketing prices will provide farmers with enough incentive to improve husbandry.
Ivory Coast also put in place a cocoa export contract auction system but there have been concerns that rules encourage exporters to overbid to win contracts, creating a parallel price above terminal market levels.
"We have particular problems in blending good cocoa with poor cocoa... particularly since the Caisse (state marketing board) stopped upcountry quality checks," said Harrison.
Exporters say poor and good quality beans are often mixed together to meet Ivory Coast's export grade standard of 105 beans per 100 grammes with under 10 percent humidity.
Harrison also called for Ivory Coast to produce more of the high-quality beans that could be used to give chocolate its cocoa flavour.
"We do use some Ivorian beans in our flavour element (for chocolate) but we have to be highly selective," he said. "To make high quality chocolate we need beans with no off-odours," said Harrison.
"Only one country produces the beans which give us the flavour element in our chocolate and that is Ghana," he added.
The size of Ghana's crop is between a third and a quarter of Ivory Coast's annual crop, which in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) hit a record 1.2 million tonnes.
It has kept upcountry checks in place and this week said it would not go ahead with donor-sponsored liberalisation of internal marketing.
Ghanaian cocoa usually attracts a $30 dollars a tonne premium over other origins, including Ivory Coast.
Ivory Coast and the World Bank held discussions in May on further cocoa sector liberalisation but disagreed on policies to increase competitiveness while maintaining quality.

Ivorian port cocoa stocks stand at up to 175,000 tonnes as arrivals trickle in at about 1,000 tonnes a week, but April and brisk May exports will reduce levels, port sources said on Friday.
"The main season (Oct-April) is over so arrivals will be down until early May," said a source. "Some exporters have stock at the margins of (export) quality limits so they will be waiting to mix it with fresh mid-crop (May-Sept)."
Sources put stocks at Abidjan at 100,000 tonnes with 75,000 at the second port of San Pedro.
Exporters' agents said some exporters were short of cocoa for immediate shipment, but others said this represented a temporary commercial squeeze rather than a broader supply problem.
"Smaller exporters may have bought contracts beyond their capacity, the Caisse may have issued too many contacts or maybe a few exporters are holding large stocks," said one shipping manager. "I have people crying out for cocoa," he added.
Another agent said, "We must wait and see if the Caisse renews export licences if contracts are broken."
Latest bean sizes were around 90-105 beans per 100 grams, against an export standard of 105 with up to eight percent humidity, industry buyers said.
"Bean sizes are tailing off now but smaller ones are still up-country," said one.
Exporters are gearing up for mid-crop arrivals after returning from Easter holidays, but crop analysts have not completed up-country pod tallies to give an indication of volumes, they said.
Early estimates range from 100,000 tonnes to well over 160,000, down on 200,000 in the 1995/96 season, crop analysts said.
"If good rains now carry on and cherelles survive through April and May, I see no reason to be pessimistic," said one. "Estimates will be out later in April but most pod counters will be up-country in mid-April."
Some main crop could be held back to mix with mid-crop to reach an overall export standard.
Tree crop and declared mid-crop could vary widely, he said.
Warehouse stocks totalled up to 400,000 tonnes in early 1997 as exporters held back cocoa bought through auction for December contracts from the Caistab marketing body.
Auction prices were out of line with world rates before a rally ahead of March contracts, they said at the time.

Declared cocoa arrivals at Ivorian ports for Ivory Coast's 1996/97 (October-April) main crop totalled 970-980,000 tonnes by April 14, close to record levels seen in the 1995/96 season, exporters and crop analysts said.
The 1995/96 main crop (ending April 30) reached just over a million tonnes.
"Arrivals are now at a trickle compared to last year but it is still possible the total (main crop) will reach a million by the end of the month," said one crop analyst.
Exporters said cocoa was arriving at Ivory Coast's two ports -- Abidjan and San Pedro -- at a total of up to 5,000 tonnes a week, compared to 8,000 tonnes a week in 1995/96.
Little or no main crop cocoa remained on south-western plantations visited by Reuters. "Cocoa is now for the mid-crop (usually smaller, poorer quality beans)," said one coastal area buyer.
Ivory Coast has forecast 950,000 tonnes for the 1996/97 season but some private forecasters upgraded their full-year predictions from that level to around 1.1 million tonnes after large arrivals in early 1997.
Last year, Ivory Coast produced a full-year record of 1.2 million tonnes after a bumper 200,000 tonne mid-crop (May-September).
Sources said Ministry of Agriculture data showed cocoa arrivals to April 4 (from October 24) stood at 940,0000 tonnes -- about six percent down from 1,003,366 last year. Another 40,000 tonnes or so should be added to the 1996/97 figure as the season opened three weeks later than the usual October 1, they said.
Other arrivals data seen by Reuters gave similar figures.
"The latest figures I have from the Caistab (cocoa and coffee marketing board) show arrivals at about 975,000 by April 14 but that is after some downward adjustments for sub-grade (inferior beans)," said one source.
Arrivals to the end of the main crop in 1994/95 were 815,000 tonnes, with weekly arrivals of under 4,000 tonnes.
Trade sources say exporters usually over-estimate arrivals early in the season to help secure bank finance, but square accounts later in the season by under-declaring.
Crop forecasters say declared arrivals in Ivory Coast can exceed tree crop harvests as quantities of cocoa are carried between seasons in the hope of price rises and to mix poor with good quality cocoa.
One cocoa buyer for Ivorian exporter Jean-Abile Gal (JAG) said the latest cocoa bean sizes averaged 98 beans per 100 grammes at San Pedro, and 105 at the main port, Abidjan -- against an export standard of up to 105 with less than eight percent humidity.
Exporters said average humidity levels at both ports were below eight percent.
Up-country buyers' stores in coastal and south-western areas were mostly empty, except for coffee, but larger warehouses at San Pedro, including JAG's, were still well stocked.
"There is nothing left. Some exporters are desperate to meet contracts and cannot get cocoa," said one buyer. "Cocoa harvested now is really for the mid-crop (from May)."
Port forwarders' figures seen by Reuters showed 1996/97 cocoa volumes handled 12 percent down on 1995/96, but managers said warehouse stocks for end-April shipment would close the gap.
"It is very acceptable. We thought the gap could be twice that," said a manager for SAGA, San Pedro's largest forwarder. "Last year, arrivals figures were a lot more available so it has been harder to track."
Cocoa bean shipments rose from 39,637 tonnes in February to 51,981 in March and at least another 10,000 tonnes was due to leave next week.
"Some of what is left in stores will be for local processors (using around 135,000 tonnes of beans a year)," said one crop analyst.
SACO, San Pedro's only factory, had large volumes of produce stored in sheds with bagged cocoa under external awnings. Cocoa product exports totalled around 4,000 tonnes for February and March.
Several new warehouses are planned to increase port cocoa storage capacity. New factories are also in the pipeline.
Exporters are now looking forward to pod counters' mid-crop predictions, expected this month, and further news on Ivory Coast's intention to destroy illegal cocoa plantations in classified forest areas.
The country's Minister for Commodities, Guy-Alain Gauze, said earlier on Friday in the Netherlands that the upcoming mid-crop would be somewhere near 100,000 tonnes.

Heavy late-March rains favoured Ivorian mid-crop cocoa harvest prospects as the month's rainfall total edged up to long-term average levels after a February drought, weather and crop analysts said on Monday.
"The rains have been very satisfactory lately," said a National Weather centre spokesman. "We are back to around average levels and the rains are continuing into April."
Official weather data for the third 10 days of March showed rains at 10 weather stations totalled 742 mm against 208 mm in the previous 10 days. An average of 111 mm fell in March.
Crop analysts said weather data weighted for plantation density and long term productivity suggested the March rains were in line with a 20-year average of around 105 mm.
Rains falling on average on five out of ten days were spread widely over Ivory Coast's cocoa belt but heaviest falls were in central areas around Daloa, Gagnoa, Yamoussoukro and Abidjan.
"Everything now depends on the (mid-crop) pod-count," said one drop analyst.
"We had good January rains, bad February rains and good March rains. I remain an optimist (for midcrop harvest volumes)," he added.
Rains during the second ten days of March were heaviest in less productive eastern border areas.
Otherwise, south-western forest areas, densely planted with productive hybrid trees, have tended to receive the most.
Crop analysts said in early March that regular showers up to April would determine how close this year's mid-crop would be to the bumper 200,000 tonnes in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) harvest season.
The 1996/97 mid-crop could exceed 150,000 tonnes if rains were sufficient, one said, adding that harvest predictions would be reviewed in April when pods on trees gave a better idea of yields.
The data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the third 10 days of March in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days in brackets):
Daloa 105.8 (2.7), Gagnoa 142.8 (20.2), San Pedro 18.3 (12.6), Tabou 1.0 (21) Man 98.7 (2.0), Dimbokro 73.2 (32.3), Yamoussoukro 83.8 (0), Abidjan 128.8 (8.9), Sassandra 10.6 (8.8), Adiake 64.5 (13.9), Korhogo 14.2 (0).

Ivory Coast's power capacity is set to increase by one third but with domestic demand slim export customers will be needed, power engineering firms and distributors said on Wednesday.
"They have about 1,200 megawatts (MW) installed but there are no large industrial users," a West Africa-based manager for Swedish power group Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) told Reuters. "One of the top 10 power consumers is a hotel."
The head of Ivory Coast's privatised power firm Compagnie d'Electricite Ivoirienne (CIE) agreed, and expected exports.
"The (domestic) problem is not so much one of construction. The techniques of construction are not a problem. It's the capacity to absorb the investment, to repay. There must be a market," CIE president Marcel Zadi Kessy said earlier this year.
ABB and five other bidders submitted proposals in April to build a $300 million, 450 MW, gas-fired power plant near the capital Abidjan on build-own-transfer terms.
The plant, at Azito, would start operating within 12 months with an initial capacity of 300 MW, which could be upgraded.
The supplier will be chosen on the basis of competitive bids based on kilowatt/hour charge, with the winner is due to be declared in May.
Plant ownership would pass to Ivory Coast after 20 years.
"Industrial companies would give us some baseload and make us less reliant on (an economy largely dependent on) cocoa and coffee prices," said ABB sub-regional manager Koen Beckers in a recent interview.
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is keen to diversify export earnings away from its rural economy.
Power companies see promising markets in mining and food processing sectors, although domestic consumption is also set to rise, with a plan to supply 7,000 more villages over the next few years.
In the 37 years since independence from France only about 1,000 villages have been connected.
"CIE (Compagnie d'Electricite Ivoirienne) has already invested quite a lot in improving grid quality," said Beckers.
A nickel mine producing 30,000 tonnes a year is planned to open around the year 2002 at Biankouma in western Ivory Coast, which could raise industrial energy consumption by a further 150 MW, he said.
About 24 companies, including many newcomers, are exploring mainly for gold in 55 permits, each of up to 1,000 square kilometres.
Ivory Coast aims to triple cocoa bean processing capacity from about 150,000 tonnes to allow domestic processing of 50 percent of its long-term average yearly cocoa crop.
Three factories are working and a further five are under discussion.
Power exports began with Ghana after Ivory Coast achieved energy self-sufficiency in 1995.
"Now they (Ivorians) are discussing interconnecting Mali," meaning Ivory Coast would be connected to five other countries, said Beckers.
Power deals now link Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Burkina Faso.
Ivory Coast also exports natural gas after using 60 percent of offshore output to feed its own thermal power stations, recently converted from other fuels.
Ivorian mines and energy Minister Lamine Fadika in April urged Ghana to fuel a new 300 MW power station at Takoradi, due on line this year with new Ivorian offshore gas under development by Shell and UMIC, a unit of Houston-based United Meridian Corp.
Ivory Coast's six hydroelectric plants can produce 604 MW and the Vridi thermal plant near Abidjan can produce 300 MW-plus.
Another 210 MW came on stream in April from CIPREL plant, a joint-venture between French firms Bouygues and Electricite de France.
A planned Regional West African Energy Community would "allow countries with excess... gas or electricity, to fulfill the needs of neighbouring countries," said Fadika at a March conference in Accra on "Meeting Africa's Oil and Gas Needs".

Industry and crop analysts are sticking to forecasts of a total Ivorian 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) cocoa crop of well over one million tonnes though the government appears to say it will be less than that figure.
"We raised our forecast to 1.07 million tonnes in January from one million tonnes but really there could be 1.1 million tonnes," said one major buyer of Ivorian cocoa.
Ivorian Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan restated on Wednesday in Paris that Ivory Coast's total 1996/97 crop would be less than one million tonnes -- in line with an earlier Ivorian Caistab marketing board estimate of 950,000 tonnes.
It was not immediately clear whether Kouassi was referring to total arrivals of cocoa at ports, or beans considered to be of sufficient quality for export.
"That would certainly not be the total arrivals figure but it could be the export figure," said one port source.
"Arrivals (of cocoa declared at ports) are already close to 900,000 tonnes (since October 1) so we are really looking at a crop of not much less than last year," said another source.
Sources close to the agriculture ministry said arrivals figures to February 21 (since October 24) stood at around 850,000 tonnes.
Quality inspectors have pointed to generally good bean quality depite humidity problems.
The 1996/97 cocoa season opened on October 24, about three weeks later than usual. Exporters have said 30,000-50,000 tonnes should be added to arrivals figures to give a cumulative arrival figure since October 1.
Crop analysts expect Ivory Coast's main crop (Oct-Sept) alone to match to the Caistab's 950,000 tonnes full-year forecast, but they said predictions of a promising mid-crop (April-Sept) were still premature.
Ivory Coast is estimated to have produced a record 1.2 million tonnes in 1995/96 after a larger than expected 200,000 tonnes mid-crop.
Prospects for this year's mid-crop depend partly on rains over the next few weeks.
Industry sources do not expect rejection of cocoa at port to reduce total exports significantly.
Industry sources said undisclosed amounts of sub-standard cocoa had been declared at ports but rejected as Fair Average Quality (FAQ) -- or unexportable sub-grade.
That would be either mixed in with better quality cocoa and exported, or bought by local factories.
Rejection of cocoa could cut into total crop figures but industry sources say little is likely to go to waste.
"Most is presented again for export. Little goes to waste so it will be sold somehow," said one exporter, referring to humidity problems in early 1997.
One set of figures circulating put arrivals to February 21 at 936,000 tonnes, with close to 150,000 tonnes initially classified as sub-grade, industry sources said.
Ivory Coast has said in the past it would process its lower quality mid-crop cocoa locally to remove lower grades from world markets and add more value to exports.
"Local factories will probably use about 160,000 tonnes this year so a certain proportion will be set aside for that," one source said.
Factory capacity currently stands at around 180,000 tonnes although plans for more factories are reaching final stages.
Foreign buyers recently voiced concern that poorer grades were being mixed in with export quality cocoa rather than being absorbed by local factories.
"The normal crop potential for Ivory Coast is around 1.17 million tonnes," said one port source. "Take off 160,000 tonnes and you are not far off the one million figure," he added.
"The question is how much will be held back for next year to speculate on prices. That depends on how much money traders have to hand," he said.

African coffee ministers meet on Thursday to discuss cutting robusta exports following a January agreement among world producers, but some officials say disease and drought make cuts unnecessary in some countries.
African producers agreed after a January meeting of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries to cut robusta exports by a total of 850,000 60-kilo bags between January and June 1997 in an attempt to force up prices.
Individual country quotas were left to be decided later.
"We shall be looking into the export programme in light of the Rio (de Janeiro) agreement and our objective is to ensure a transparent and effective implementation," said a spokesman for the Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO).
"The ministers will take a decision on how to allocate the share which falls on Africa and how to deal with shortfalls," said IACO chief economist Donald Kaberuka. "We will also discuss the issue of non-member countries."
Eight countries will take part in the talks -- Uganda, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Kenya, Zaire, Tanzania, Madagascar and Ethiopia.
Quotas for individual countries set at the meeting would not be made public.
"Some people have said we will not make any cuts but that is not true," said Kaberuka.
A Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) official said this week that drought and disease had cut into that country's exports, making quotas unnecessary.
Uganda is Africa's largest robusta producer.
It produced around 4,644,397 60-kilo bags in 1996 against 3,079,261 in 1995, according to IACO. Ivory Coast produced 2,526,198 and 2,493,754 over the same periods.
Analysts in Ivory Coast say bean quality problems could mean no more than 130,000-150,000 tonnes will be exported in 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) despite an official forecast of 230,000 tonnes.
Ivorian exports by the end of January totalled little more than 24,000 tonnes. The season opened on November 14.
The Coffee Board of Kenya, also citing drought and disease, has forecast a drop in production and earnings this year.
Zaire's production has been cut by the conflict there since late 1996.

Ivory Coast has received three formal proposals for building new cocoa processing factories but no approvals have yet been notified, Ivorian Commodities Minister Guy Alain-Gauze said on Friday.
"There are projects involving Canatalou, STF-CI and Cargill," Gauze told Reuters after three days of cocoa sector reform talks with International Cocoa Organisation, donor and Ivorian officials. "All have submitted formal proposals to the government which are being considered," he added.
Ivory Coast aims to process annually 50 percent of its cocoa production it wants stabilised at 900,000 tonnes a year.
In 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) an unexpectedly large 200,000 tonne mid-crop (April-Sept) took output to a 1.2 million tonne record.
Total 1996/97 season output is expected to be over a million tonnes and higher, depending on the shape of the mid-crop.
Rumours of factory plans surfaced in late 1996 with many firms said to be interested without deals signed.
French Perpignan-based confectioner Cantalou, which makes CEMOI brands, has submitted proposals for building a 60,000 tonnes of beans a year capcity plant.
An Ivorian firm, STF-CI, and a French partner are discussing building a 15,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes capacity plant for exporting cocoa butter and liquor exports to a Chinese chocolate factory under construction.
U.S-based commodities giant Cargill, in discussions with Ivorian cocoa exporter SICC for construction of a third plant, has also submitted plans to Ivory Coast's government.
Its capacity would be over 50,000 tonnes a year according to industry sources.
SICC told Reuters its first processing project was likely to take shape in early 1997. The firm handles a total of 200,000 tonnes of cocoa in 1996/97 for clients including Cargill's Netherlands processing subsidiary Gherkens.
"We cannot think of handling that much without going into processing. We want to start in 1997 and are now at the decision stages with our partners," Deputy-Director Guillaume Adome told Reuters in an interview.
One European processor industry in Abidjan for cocoa talks said he was surprised that a 25,000 tonne plant would be used for cocoa butter as well as powder production.
"It seems a bit on the small side for that," he said.
Other industry delgates to the cocoa talks said it would be difficult to built plants by the end of 1997 but not impossible.
Philippe Mian, technical advisor to Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, yesterday told Reuters all three plans were firm but that other factory plan proposals also existed.
"Procurement stages are advanced so it would be possible," he said, referring to the end of 1997 date.
Mian presided over of three days of Consultative Committee cocoa reform talks which ended in Abidjan on Friday during which cocoa processing and cocoa quality were discussed.
Gauze told Reuters Ivory Coast would be on target to meet its home processing goal if the plans went ahead.
Ivory Coast currently has three processing factories with capacity for 180,000 tonnes. One is expected to increase capacity by 21,500 tonnes by 1998 taking Ivorian total capacity to 201,500 tonnes.
If all three plant proposals are given government approval capacity would rise top a maximum of around 336,500 tonnes.
Some industry observers have said Ivory Coast's processing target is unattainable.
Local procesing of beans is part of an overall policy to add value to exports while taking low quality mid-crop (April-Sept) beans off the international market.
"Most output would have no effect on this year as it usually takes up to a year to build a normal plant," said one local processing official.

British betting and Hilton hotel company Ladbroke Group Plc on Thursday posted a 34 percent increase in 1996 pretax profits to 163 million pounds ($263 million) before exceptional items and forecast further good progress during 1997.
Chief executive Peter George also made positive remarks about trading since its 1996 year ended on December 31.
"The same trend has continued in the last two months. The businesses are doing well. It does seem to be getting gradually better this year in mainland Europe," George said in an interview. Trading profits from its European hotels fell slightly in 1996.
"In Germany we have seen a few patchy signs of improvement. A few of our properties have actually done better in the first couple of months this year than last year but I would not say that augurs for a recovery this year."
"I think it will take up to another 12 months for Germany to come back."
Revenue per available room (RevPar) in hotels in mainland Europe fell to 50.8 pounds in 1996 from 52.1 pounds. In London it rose to 70.4 pounds from 60.4 and to 37.9 pounds from 33.2 pounds elsewhere in Britain.
"Japan is still tough I must say, Tokyo and particularly for us Osaka where new properties have been opened," George said.
Overall hotel occupancy levels rose slightly to 69.6 percent from 69 percent and group RevPar moved from 48 pounds to 49.3 pounds.
Ladbroke shares put on 10p to reach 235p in morning trade as the company's headline profit figure pipped the consensus forecast from brokers of 160 million pounds.
"The results were a little better than our expectations at both the pretax and the earnings per share level," said Nigel Reed, industry analyst at Paribas Capital Markets. Earnings per share before exceptional items were up 40 percent to 10.44 pence during the period.
Hilton International, which operates Hilton hotels outside the United States, increased trading profits by an underlying 20 percent to 160.2 million, and the betting and gaming division grew profits by 46 percent to 84.9 million.
Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp agreed to reunite the Hilton hotels brand worldwide for the first time in 32 years in January. Previously HHC had the rights to the Hilton name in the United States and Ladbroke owned them elsewhere.
"Betting was much better than we thought and hotels were slightly under what we thought they could do," Reed said.
Ladbroke's retail betting business in Britain showed a marked recovery despite the 8.0 million pound cost associated with jockey Frankie Dettori's unique feat of winning all seven races at an Ascot race meeting last September.
On the casino side, the only disappointment was London's Maxims club, where George said there had been a reduction in high stake gambling and the company had made provisions for outstanding debt.
But a weaker performance from Ladbroke's casino division was more than offset by earnings in retail betting where trading profit rose to 59.8 million in 1996 from 34.1 million.
George said the company, which has decided to close down its property division, was still trying to dispose of two properties in the United States and one in Israel which should make a total gain of about 70 million pounds.
Net debt fell by 315.6 million to 707.7 million, reducing the interest charge by 25.8 million to 70.3 million. At its peak three years ago the company was crippled by debt of 1.6 billion pounds during a deep recession in the property market.
Exceptional items amounted to 103.8 million pounds included 52.3 million arising from the group's exit from commercial property and 15.4 million for the adjustment to the price of DIY retailer Texas Homecare sold to J. Sainsbury two years ago.

British leisure and brewery group Whitbread Plc said on Thursday it had appointed David Thomas as its chief executive designate to take over from Peter Jarvis who is to step down next summer.
Thomas's appointment was viewed by the investment community as a natural progression from the Jarvis era, which saw Whitbread aggressively transform itself from a brewer to a diversified leisure company in less than six years.
Since 1985, Whitbread has changed its business mix. Beer now only accounts for 14 percent of profits, with the rest coming from its managed estates, restaurant and leisure arm.
Analysts expect Thomas to press ahead with Whitbread's expansion into the leisure and restaurant business while retaining its interest in brewing.
"It's just going to be basically more of the same, he's going to continue to take them down the retail, leisure route," said Charles Winston, an analyst at BZW.
A slide in Whitbread shares, down 12.5p at 763p, was attributed more to profit-taking than any disappointment at the new executive appointment.
"It's more of a tribute to Jarvis than a thumbs down for Thomas. They have also had a very good run up of late," said one analyst who declined to be named.
"We knew he was going to leave before retirement age although these announcements are always a bit of a surprise when they come," said John Beaumont, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
But he added: "The appointment of David Thomas seems like a natural progression for the company."
Thomas, who was appointed to the main board in 1991 and took over the restaurant and leisure division in 1992, is credited with accelerating the development of Whitbread's existing brands -- Travel Inn, restaurants TGI Friday's and Beefeater.
He was also the architect of Whitbread's drive into the pub food market through Brewers Fayre.
Jarvis, aged 55, has hinted to reporters at recent news conferences that he would prefer to leave the company before reaching retirement age in order to pursue outside interests. He is currently a non-executive director of Burton, Rank and Barclays Plc.

Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever NV/Plc reported a 15 percent rise in annual profits on Tuesday and put its speciality chemicals units up for sale in a move tipped to raise up to 5 billion British pounds ($8.17 billion).
Pre-tax profit rose to 2.66 billion pounds ($4.4 billion) on a 6 percent rise in revenues to 33.52 billion ($54.7 billion). 2.
Unilever shares surged on the results, which were better than analysts had forecast, and on the planned speciality chemicals sale.
Unilever Plc shares surged 86-1/2 pence to 1,479-1/2 ($24.17) in London as some looked to raise 1997 forecasts.
Chairman Niall FitzGerald said the sale of the speciality chemicals businesses would enable the group to concentrate on achieving growth in its consumer goods operations, particularly in developing and emerging markets.
Analysts said the sale, which could free Unilever up for a major acquisition in its main food, detergents and personal products businesses, was well timed.
FitzGerald said, meanwhile, that the overall economic situation in 1997, as in 1996, was likely to be generally favourable for the group, which is the world's largest producer of both margarine and ice cream, with activities from food to toiletries.
But he saw little reason to believe that conditions in Europe, particularly in France and Germany, would improve.
"We will now seek actively buyers for the totality or the individual (chemicals) businesses and we will then assess those over the next month or two," FitzGerald told Reuters. "We would hope to conclude a sale in the course of the next three to six months."
FitzGerald declined to say how much the businesses, with 15,800 staff in more than 35 countries, might be worth.
Analysts estimate the sale should fetch 4.5 billion to 5 billion pounds ($7.35 billion to 8.17 billion), and FitzGerald told a news conference in the short term it would wipe out the company's net borrowings of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.78 billion).
The funds would also be used for acquisitions in growth areas, FitzGerald told reporters, such as Asia Pacific and South America and in priority categories like detergents, tea, ice cream, yellow fats, personal care products and fragrances.
"We have a carefully defined list of what we may do with (the proceeds), which I am not prepared to discuss," he said. "In China I would like to have a business 10 times the size."
The four units -- National Starch and Chemical Company, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- have combined turnover of 3 billion pounds ($4.9 billion), 9 percent of Unilever's total sales, and showed operating profit of 415 million ($678 million) in 1996, with margins of 14.1 percent.
"These are extremely large and important parts of our businesses but for some time we have been reviewing whether they should be a continuing part of the portfolio -- not because they are poorly performing themselves, they are excellent performers -- but whether we can give them the concentration and the focus that they require," FitzGerald said.
"...if you look at the way this industry is developing we have to take a decision either to significantly improve our presence in these markets, perhaps double it, or to exit and in exiting to concentrate on the other 90 percent of our business which is our mainstream consumer goods business."
Commenting on the overall results, Unilever said its performance in Europe was held back by poor weather hitting ice cream sales and by the impact of the mad cow disease crisis.
But good progress in North American market conditions provided the basis for better results there and the momentum of growth continued strongly in the fast-growing emerging markets.

Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever NV/Plc should report a 10 percent improvement in underlying profits for the full year on Tuesday but the increase will be marred by sterling's surge on foreign exchange markets. 
Analysts also expected Unilever to unveil a hefty charge for reorganising some of its newly acquired businesses like personal products company Helene Curtis and industrial cleaner Diversey.
On average, 24 brokers polled forecast 1996 pretax profits of 2.525 billion stg up from 2.319 billion for the year to December 31, 1995.
The company is expected to take a currency hit of about 50 million stg in the fourth quarter rising to as much as 210 million in 1997.
A restructuring charge of 80 million stg on average for the fourth quarter should bring the total to about 220 million net for the year.
Most of the curency movement took place in the fourth quarter and Unilever operates a currency policy of applying constant exchange rates until the fourth quarter, at the end of which it calculates and applies the average rate for the year.
Sterling has apprectiated by 11.1 percent since October 1, 1996 against the ECU and about 45 percent of Unilever's business is in hard European currency terms.
The real impact of currency movements will come through in the dividend payout, which is set as a percentage of earnings in sterling and Dutch guilder.
Analysts forecast the total dividend in sterling will rise 4.8 percent to 30.8p but by some 8.0 percent in guilders to 8.73 guilders.
In early January, many brokers recommended switching out of Unilever Plc to its NV shares to pick-up the benefit, a factor which has dragged down the company's London share price.
Unilever Plc shares were 7-1/2p lower at 1357p on Friday, but in four out of the last five years the p/e ratio has fallen to 13.5 or 14 times in the early part of the year before climbing steeply ahead of the first half figures.
Brokers' estimated profits for 1997 are dependent on key assumptions about currency rates and the breakdown of income streams by currency -- many are working on the basis of $1.70 average for the year against the pound and 2.65 mark -- but six houses have downgraded their 1997 forecasts over the last month.
"Our reading of the clues so far is to expect a higher gross restructuring than perhaps others," said Michael Bourke, analyst at Panmure Gordon, who is estimating a charge of 110 million in the fourth quarter to give 250 million net for the year.
"The fourth quarter tends to be where they dump the bulk of their charges and their recent acquisitions have needed considerable reorganisation," he said.
Analysts expect to see profits driven by continued sales growth in the emerging markets of South America and a pick up in North America.
However, earnings from Europe and especially Germany are likely to remain depressed.
"North America and Latam are likely to be big the engines for growth whereas Europe remains a difficult market, but we should see the benefits of rationalisation start to come through there," said Nikko analyst Dermott Carr.
Brokers are keen to get a tighter grip on chairman Niall FitzGerald's strategy.
Since taking over as chairman in September, FitzGerald has talked about re-shaping the group to give it a sharper focus.
"I think the market is expecting a bit too much of one man. I don't think FitzGerald will be as radical as many think but it would be interesting to get a clearer view of what he defines as a non-core business," said Carr.
Generally analysts think Unilever will remain a fairly broad church under FitzGerald rather than a pure, branded food company and unlike the single brand focus of a Coca-Cola or Procter &amp; Gamble .

Britain's United Biscuits (Holdings) Plc expects its margins in Europe to remain firm and to move up over the next two to three years, said managing director Eric Nicoli.
"We expect margins to move to 10 percent in all our businesses over a two or three year period," said Nicoli in an interview. UB margins are currently at around 10 percent in Britain and four percent in mainland Europe.
(Corrects to make clear company isn't expecting European margins alone to move by 10 percent over the next two to three years.)
Earlier the company reported a more than doubling in pretax, pre-exceptional annual profits to 109.1 million stg. UB shares were 7-1/2p higher at 246p in early trade.  
UB has now entered a phase of consolidation, after a hectic disposal programme, which means the emphasis is on organic growth, said Nicoli.
Over the last two years the company has sold its American snack operation Keebler, pulled out of Portugal and exited from Spanish snacks. It has also sold one of its Italian snack businesses, withdrawn from Turkey and Brazil and sold Ross Vegetables Products business in Britain.  
"The emphasis on organic growth as we are now in a consolidation phase," said Nicoli.
When asked about the outlook for the company he said, "Our markets continue to be very competitive but we expect another year of good progress."
In Britain, there is a trend among shoppers to switch into higher value lines against a background of improved consumer confidence, said Nicoli.
In mainland Europe, he said the company's businesses will improve but it did not expect any help from the markets.

Food service company Compass Group still has plenty of growth potential to come from the global trend towards contracting out catering, said chief executive Francis Mackay in an interview.
"There is a natural and gradual process of out-sourcing catering, which will continue at least until the year 2000. If you take Europe and the U.S. together, the market is worth about 100 billion pounds, of which only 30 billion is outsourced." "That leaves two-thirds of the market still available, and we are in a very strong position to take advantage of that."

British food manufacturer Dalgety Plc posted an 8.5 percent fall in profits on Monday to 43 million pounds ($70.5 million) in the six months to December 31, 1996 as sales of its beef and animal feeds slid.
The company was hit by evidence showing that the brain wasting disease Bovine Spongiform Encepthalopathy (BSE) in cattle, known as mad-cow disease, could spread to humans who ate infected meat.
The European Union imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports last March and insisted on the slaughter of thousands of British cattle, a cull which has been delayed.
But Dalgety chief executive Richard Clothier said things should improve. "During the second half the continued improvements in Petfoods, new capacity and new products in Food Ingredients and the declining effects of BSE in Dalgety Agriculture are expected to result in a much improved performance," said Clothier.
Analysts had forecast pre-tax profits of 41-45.5 million pounds. Dalgety maintained its dividend at 8.5p in anticipation of a better second half performance.
"The figures are pretty much as flagged in terms of what it tells us about the shape, size and direction of the company," said UBS analyst Charles Mills.
Dalgety shares were up 2p at 341p in early trade, helped by positive remarks from Clothier.
The export ban on British beef affected Dalgety's manufacturing organisation and temporarily resulted in higher costs of outsourcing and distribution.
In Petfoods, Dalgety improved trading profit by eight percent to 17.9 million pounds in the first half, helped by cat food, with sales of the Felix brand up 16 percent across Europe.
Operating profit from the company's agri-business fell 23 percent to 15 million pounds as a direct result of the effects of BSE on British cattle feed.
"Sales volumes of cattle feed for the six months period fell by 30 percent, as the delay in the culling programme resulted in excess milk production which reduced the demand for feed and created intense price competition in the market," said Clothier.
Operating profit from food ingredients was steady at 15.3 million pounds as fears over BSE reduced the sales of meat seasonings in the first quarter. But demand for alternatives had now offset the decline in beef-based foods, Clothier said.
In food distribution, Dalgety's profits fell seven percent to 5.6 million due in part to the strength of sterling against the dollar. Growth in the American fast food market slowed, affecting hamburger chain McDonald's sales, said Clothier.
"The outlook remains tough in the U.S. but McDonald's are responding with vigour and developments in new markets such as Brazil and Mexico provide good opportunities for future growth," he added.
The group's net debt increased to 305 million pounds from 281 million, giving a gearing ratio of 76 percent. ($1=.6097 Pound)

Britain's biggest cider maker H P Bulmer on Wednesday played down the runaway success of so-called "alcopops" -- fruit flavoured alcoholic drinks -- on its business, saying their impact had not been significant.
"It's important to get it into perspective. The total alcopops market is only about 60 percent of sales volume of our Strongbow," said chief executive John Rudgard.
"Yes it's big. Its grown from nowhere very quickly. There is no doubt that people who drink alcopops have taken sales from a wide variety of other drinks but the biggest substition is from lager."
There is some substitution from ciders, but within that category the biggest impact is on fashion type ciders which Bulmer does not have in its brand portfolio, said Rudgard.
"We have strong brands which provides us some insulation against competition. We have not found the same difficulties as Matthew Clarke."
In September Clarke shook the stock market with a profit warning, citing tough competition from alcopops and a flood of cheap cider products. The warning wiped more than 290 million stg off the company's stock market value.
Rudgard said Bulmer's brands, which include Strongbow, White Lightning, Stonehouse and Scrumpy Jack, have proved more resilient while the cider market is still growing despite the introduction of alcopops.
According to the latest National Association of Cider Makers figures the cider market grew by 4.1 percent to 115 million gallons in the 12 months to September 1996. Bulmer sales were up 7.5 percent in the same period, excluding Inch's Cider Company which it acquired for 23 million stg in May.
Inch's made a trading profit of 1.5 million stg. Group trading profit before exceptional items was up 13.7 percent at 19.5 million stg.
Bulmer increased its share of the UK cider market by 3 percent to 53 percent.
Operating margins in the UK fell to 12.6 percent from 12.7 percent due to the marketing investments in its export markets, particularly on Strongbow.
Rudgard said margins will continue to remain lower as investment programme overseas is stepped up.

When China wanted to hide the death of an emperor on the road 2,000 years ago it filled his carriage with fish to disguise the smell.
Now it uses enigmatic language to throw a smokescreen around the state of its leaders' health.
Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who remains China's most powerful leader even though he formally retired from his last official post in 1990, is 92 and frail, and has not been seen in public for more than three years.
China's Communist Party leaders have shrouded Deng and his health in a veil of secrecy, issuing only terse statements saying he is as well as can be expected for a man of his advanced years, or that there has been "no big change".
"This is Chinese culture," said one Western diplomat. "The emperor can't be seen to be dying until he actually dies."
The power struggle on the death of a Chinese emperor -- or communist strongman -- has traditionally been bloody, and analysts say the departure of Deng is unlikely to be an exception.
When China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, died while travelling in the south in 210 BC, his prime minister filled the emperor's carriage with fish for two weeks to hide the smell of the rotting corpse, fearing a power struggle before he could reach the capital.
China's communist leaders will probably not conceal the death of Deng for as long as two weeks -- the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 was announced within 12 hours of his passing.
But they are doing their utmost to prevent hard information on any deterioration in Deng's health from reaching the 1.2 billion Chinese whose fate could hang in the balance.
The instinct for self-preservation and a Chinese abhorrence of any talk of death may be two motivations behind the secrecy of Deng's anointed successor, Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin, and his colleagues.
"There is always a nexus between the health of the nation and its leader," said a Western sinologist who declined to be identified. "In a culture so concerned with life and longevity... death is the ultimate horror."
One Chinese analyst agreed.
"In China's current system, the fate of the nation depends on the fate of the leader," he said.
"They are not only afraid that news that Deng is close to death could spark a really fierce power struggle, but they also worry about public instability," he said.
Deng is not the only powerful communist veteran of Mao's generation who still lives, and any elder who outlives Deng could step into his shoes as kingmaker and force a power struggle around Jiang.
Most diplomats say Jiang has already consolidated his position as Deng's successor in the party, government and military and say major blood-letting is unlikely after Deng's death. Jiang has even disbanded Deng's personal office.
"I don't think it's going to come as a shock to anybody when he finally does pass away," another Western diplomat said.
"It's not going to really mean a big shake-up in the leadership here or tanks rolling down the street," she said.
Still Beijing prefers to keep Deng's situation a secret. China's communist rulers inherit a system of based on veneration for age.
"It is highly disrespectful to the leader to discuss his health in public," said the Western sinologist.

Talks between China and the United States on a new textile accord neared a deadline on Friday for a trans-Pacific trade war, but industry experts said they expected an agreement within hours.
Chief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes held talks through Thursday night and into Friday evening with Chinese officials to try to iron out problems in renewal of a 1994 textile accord and to resolve a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports.
U.S. officials said they were hoping for an agreement before the Friday deadline expires at midnight on January 31 Eastern Standard Time, but differences over market access in China appeared to be delaying progress.
Hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement, said U.S. industry representatives on the sidelines of the talks.
"We fully expect they will reach an agreement," said one U.S. industry representative.
"I expect the reason for the talks not wrapping up is market access," said National Retail Federation vice-president Robert P. Hall. "This is an issue that is not traditionally part of apparel bilaterals."
Hayes had been upbeat about progress in the talks on Thursday, citing significant headway on the issue of market access and saying she hoped for a deal by the end of the day. However, that failed to materialise.
Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the January 31 deadline, Hayes said earlier. The United States would not give China another extension of the deadline, she said.
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries. The United States has threatened multi-million dollar penalties and raised the spectre of a cross-Pacific trade war over the issue.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Textiles are just one of a range of issues dogging a Sino-U.S. relationship that has long been strained by disputes over topics ranging from trade to human rights to Taiwan.
A U.S. delegation left Beijing on Friday after talks on human rights with Chinese officials and following a year in which all remaining members of the nation's tiny pro-democracy movement have been either imprisoned or driven into exile.
U.S. trade official Lee Sands wrapped up two days of talks in Beijing on Friday to discuss China's delayed accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), long a source of cross-Pacific friction.
Beijing, which wants to join the global trade club on the favourable terms accorded to developing countries, has accused Washington of blocking its entry.

China lashed out on Friday at U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, saying some political prisoners the group defended were convicted rapists and swindlers, and accused it of adopting a Cold War mentality.
The chapter on China in the World Report 1997 released by the human rights monitoring group last month "contains malicious and slanderous attacks against China's human rights situation and is frivolous and unjust", the official Xinhua news agency said.
Beijing regularly retaliates against criticism of its human rights record, regarding it as interference in its internal affairs and saying its priority is to fulfil the right of its 1.2 billion people to food and clothing.
"The report terms those criminals who have been convicted of crimes such as hooliganism, swindling, bribery and embezzlement and endangering the state security as 'dissidents' and 'political prisoners'," Xinhua said, quoting an official of the China Society for the Study of Human Rights.
"This cannot but make the readers suspicious of its true intentions," he said.
In the past year, China has effectively silenced its tiny community of dissidents, jailing several for lengthy terms for crimes ranging from hooliganism to plotting to subvert the state and sentencing others to up to three years of re-education through labour.
"They are feeling under pressure as a result of groups such as ours on human rights," Robin Munro, who runs the Hong Kong office of Human Rights Watch/Asia, said by telephone.
"Rather than respond to the criticisms it is much easier to try to discredit and undermine the charges," he said. "It is hard to take this kind of vituperative diatribe seriously."
The report contained the first official confirmation that Guo Haifeng, a leader of 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy, had been sentenced -- receiving a five-year jail term last November for the catch-all crime of hooliganism.
"He later raped six women, married or unmarried, in defiance of laws, by tempting them with the ways of talking about love affairs or buying houses, which constituted hooliganism," Xinhua said.
Chinese courts frequently sentence people to jail for hooliganism in cases where sex outside marriage, rather than rape, may have occurred. Sex outside marriage is an offence in China, while rape is punishable by death.
Guo had confessed to his crimes, Xinhua said, dismissing the Human Rights Watch report that Guo had been jailed for helping another dissident flee the country.
Xinhua attacked Human Rights Watch for describing Xiao Biguang as a political prisoner when he had been ordered in 1994 to serve three years of re-education through labour for swindling.
"They know perfectly well that he was sentenced for his activities in the underground church in China and in labour relations," Munro said of Xiao.
The Chinese human rights researcher accused Human Rights Watch of maintaining a Cold War mentality, of political bias against a socialist China and said it had become "the most aggressive vanguard of the anti-China force".
"If Human Rights Watch persists in acting as the instigator and troublemaker in creating conflicts over the issue of human rights, it will certainly become a hindrance and stumbling block in the development of the world human rights cause," he said.

China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping died late on Wednesday of complications from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection, the Communist Party announced.
The official announcement listed Deng's age as 93. He was born on August 22, 1904, but China adds a year to a person's age after the lunar new year, which fell earlier this month.
Announcement of Deng's death came in a letter to the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army and the people of various ethnic groups throughout China and issued by the official Xinhua news agency.
Deng, the man whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, died at 21.08 (1308 GMT) in Beijing, Xinhua said.
The party and government "proclaim with profound grief to the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country that our beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping... passed away", Xinhua said.
Deng was in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease with complications of lung infections and died of respiratory failure after he did not respond to emergency treatment, Xinhua said.
Chinese sources close to the party said doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy on Deng before he died.
The streets were quiet and calm after China's announcement came in the middle of the night, but additional police were seen around the Zhongnanhai government compound in central Beijing and some major intersections.
Two armed police carrying assault rifles stood guard at the end of the lane in central Beijing where Deng had lived and questioned reporters who tried to stop in the area.
Visitors in small groups were going in and out of the compound where Deng lived, on a leafy alley behind the Forbidden City that once housed China's emperors.
Analysts said they expected a relatively stable transition of power since Deng's anointed successor Jiang Zemin has already amassed the positions of Communist Party chief, state President and head of the armed forces.
The official Xinhua news agency began to issue a lengthy obiturary filled with praise for the man who ruled China from 1978 until he retired from his last official post in 1990, but whose influence remained supreme until his death.
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader enjoying high prestige acknowledged by the Party, the army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout China," Xinhua said.
It called him "a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat, and a long-tested communist fighter, the chief architect of China's socialist reforms, opening up and modernisation drive, and the founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics".
The long stream of titles that did not omit any of the adjectives that China's Communist Party associates with a senior leader in a eulogy, was an official mark that the party planned to ensure Deng was buried with full party honours, analysts said.
Deng had not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival, when he appeared frail and faltering in a visit to Shanghai.
Chinese sources told Reuters earlier this week that Communist Party chief and state President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng both cut short out-of-town trips last weekend to return to Beijing to visit the ailing patriarch.

U.S. and Chinese negotiators were locked in last-ditch talks into the night on Saturday to try to hammer out a new textile accord and a deal on market access as a new deadline loomed for a cross-Pacific trade war.
However, U.S. officials hinted that an agreement could be virtually in the bag with negotiators expected to work virtually through the night to put the finishing touches to a final text.
Chief U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said earlier she was confident of accord on renewing a 1994 textile accord and resolving a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese exports on the fifth day of talks with officials at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
"We felt like we had made tremendous progress and we are looking to complete negotiations today," she told Reuters before leaving for the ministry. "You're always positive you can reach an agreement but you have to balance it out."
The United States had extended by a day the deadline of midnight January 31 in Washington (0500 GMT) for agreement on a new textile accord.
"I felt like it was important to extend it, the deadline, for one day... so we could get a fresh start this morning," Hayes said of the talks that went virtually without a break for 48 hours on Thursday and Friday.
"We did not complete the agreement... so we felt like we'd have one extra day to complete it," she said before resuming negotiations that dragged late into Saturday without agreement as a new deadline loomed.
U.S. officials had said they hoped for a deal by the end of Saturday.
The Sino-U.S. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise. Officials declined to say whether the threatened multi-billion penalties on China would be imposed if the deadline extension expired without accord.
Chinese officials refused to comment, saying only talks were continuing.
Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.
China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.
Hayes said the U.S. side was still focusing on two major demands -- its market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.
"The two main things that we have been consistently concerned about are the market access that China has to the United States... and also making sure that it is balanced, that we have a market access package from China," she said.
Disagreement over market access in China appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier.
However, they said hopes for a deal were high, with Hayes and her team believed to be putting the finishing touches to the text of an agreement.
Washington could make significant cuts to China's textile quotas if agreement could not be reached before the previous deadline of January 31, Hayes has said.
Washington and Beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in a dispute over Chinese exports of textiles via third countries.

China has set up a special bureau to fight corruption, and the new organisation is empowered to tackle extreme cases involving the most senior officials, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.
The Special Case Investigation Section (SCIS) had been set up to to investigate more serious or extreme cases of corruption this year, Xinhua said, in a hint that Beijing may be ready to take on more high-ranking officials over graft.
The SCIS would target "extremely severe legal cases and disciplinary offenses by officials at or above the department level in central government offices and those at or above the vice-governor level in local areas", it quoted an official with the Supreme People's Procuratorate as saying.
The SCIS is part of the Law and Discipline Department of the Procuratorate.
"This has been a major step by the Procuratorate to make a breakthrough in solving cases of neglect of duty by state employees, or violations of citizens' rights, abuse of power, and other major crimes," the official said.
The SCIS was now organising a 50-member team and would start its work as soon as possible, he said.
China's procurators have said they face an uphill task to tackle corruption that has sprung up nationwide and at all levels of the Communist Party and government since paramount leader Deng Xiaoping launched his market reforms in 1978.
Harsh penalties, including the death penalty in extremely large or high-level cases, have failed to deter greedy officials.
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin has warned repeatedly that graft is a virus that could eventually topple the party if it is allowed to spread unchecked.
It was not clear whether the new task force would be empowered to take on the case of disgraced former Beijing municipal party boss, Chen Xitong, who has been under investigation since April, 1995 for suspected corruption.
In 1995, Chen became the first member of the ruling Politburo to be sacked for corruption since the 1949 communist takeover. He has yet to be charged.
A former colleague, Beijing vice-mayor Zhang Baifa said last month that Chen could face disciplinary action for alleged dereliction of duty but was unlikely to face charges of graft.
Chen's case had been one of the most difficult, China's top corruption official said last year, describing the problems of fighting graft in the face of powerful interference.
Chen and his associates had prepared well for investigation, changing bank accounts, altering contracts and making sure their testimony was consistent, Luo Ji, director of the Supreme People's Procuratorate's General Anti-Corruption and Bribery Administration said.
Official graft was almost unknown in China under the authoritiarian rule of the late Chairman Mao Zedong, but has boomed as Deng's reforms have opened up loopholes in the system and unprecedented opportunities for officials to profit from their positions.
Chen's departure from power came only after Beijing vice-mayor Wang Baosen committed suicide after coming under investigation in a $37 million corruption scam.

The number of bankruptcies in China soared by more than 160 percent in 1996 to exceed the total of the previous seven years but experts on Tuesday warned that many more insolvent firms waited in the wings.
"This is a startling figure," bankruptcy expert Cao Siyuan said in a telephone interview.
A total of 6,232 firms declared bankruptcy in China last year, an increase of 161.3 percent compared with 1995 when 2,385 companies went under, said Cao, architect of China's existing bankruptcy law and who now runs his own consultancy business.
The 1996 figure compared with the total of 5,395 firms that went bankrupt from 1989 to 1995, said Cao.
He attributed the sharp rise in the number of bankruptcies to the progress of China's market-oriented reforms launched in 1978 by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to replace Stalinist-style central planning with a sink-or-swim system.
"Many of the firms that went bankrupt last year were already effectively bankrupt but had delayed their final procedures or announcement," Cao said. "It was a situation where they had no choice but to declare bankruptcy."
He estimated the number of bankruptcies this year could soar as China pushed ahead with reforms to force its thousands of loss-making state enterprises to turn a profit or go under.
"Bankruptcies could exceed 10,000 this year if the government doesn't interfere," Cao said.
Bankruptcy has long been controversial in China even after the bankruptcy law was passed in 1988 and the law has generally been used only to liquidate smaller enterprises because of fears of mass unemployment and unrest.
Bankruptcies would increase dramatically if all firms that actually were no longer viable were allowed to go under, Cao said.
The current rate of bankruptcies was about 0.06 percent of China's estimated 10 million companies, including private and collective firms as well as the 100,000 strong state sector.
"I think a level of 1.0 percent would be more reasonable," Cao said, dismissing fears among some sectors of the government that the level of bankruptcies was too high.
Beijing's communist rulers have been trying to promote the use of mergers rather than bankruptcies to liquidate firms that have no hope of getting out of the red.
Mergers far exceeded bankruptcies, but no specific numbers were available, Cao said.
Only a tiny number of China's bankruptcies were a result of a decision by banks to foreclose, Cao said, adding that this phenomenon needed attention.
Of the 2,385 bankruptcies in 1995, only 47, or two percent, were a result of applications from the banks, while in 1996 the number was just 72, or just 1.2 percent of the total, Cao said.
One reason for the reluctance of banks to foreclose was because many branches had extended loans to enterprises without following the correct procedures, he said, adding that managers were afraid of possible repercussions if the level of bad debt became public knowledge.
Officials have said state commercial banks would write off 30 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) in bad debts of state enterprises in 1997, up from 20 billion yuan in 1996.
Many of the bankruptcies last year were in China's fast-developing coastal provinces where reforms had made greater progress, Cao said.
Far fewer were reported in booming southern Guangdong province were firms were more reluctant to admit defeat or in the capital, Beijing, where officials feared bankruptcies would result in layoffs and possible social unrest, he said.

China plans "education" sessions among its restive Moslem Uighur minority after an anti-Chinese riot in the northwestern Xinjiang region left nine people dead and nearly 200 wounded, officials said on Thursday.
Officials would launch an education campaign throughout the region to teach Xinjiang's Uighurs about the importance of patriotism and to persuade them not to take part in such unrest in future.
"We are preparing a circular to distribute throughout Xinjiang on this incident," Zhang Yuliang, director of the propaganda department of the Xinjiang regional Communist Party committee, told Reuters by telephone from the regional capital, Urumqi.
"We will carry out a session of education for the masses to teach them about ethnic unity," he said.
Authorities have issued emergency circulars calling on local officials to deal a blow to separatism in the frontier region.
Police in Yining near China's border with Kazakhstan were interrogating the suspected ringleaders of the two-day riot against Chinese rule that rocked the town last week, officials said by telephone.
One Yining government official said authorities had revised the toll from the riot, saying nine people had been killed, including four policemen. Officials previously said 10 people died.
At least 198 people had been wounded, including about 50 who were seriously injured, the official said.
Police had arrested 200 to 300 people after the riot last week in which about 1,000 people, mostly Uighur farmers or unemployed youths, rampaged through Yining, smashing and burning cars, looting shops and demanding China pull out of Xinjiang, officials said.
A Chinese source has said the riot erupted after a Uighur criminal suspect resisted arrest by police.
The riot was one of the largest, most violent demonstrations for independence in the mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang -- which means New Frontier in Chinese -- since the 1949 communist takeover.
However, many of those detained had since been released,
"The vast majority of those arrested were members of the public who had been hoodwinked into taking part and they have been released," Zhang said.
"But as for the leading criminals, they will be dealt with according to the law," he said. "We will do our best to ensure swift and severe punishment of criminals."
Police were interrogating suspected ringleader Abudu Heilili, 29, of the Uighur ethnic minority, he said.
"For people like this, who have taken part in many such incidents, we are investigating to see whether more sinister forces are working behind them," he said.
Officials have accused unidentified "hostile foreign forces" of fomenting the unrest in Yining, 50 km (30 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan, where many exiled Uighur separatists live.
Turkic-speaking Uighurs are in the majority in Xinjiang, where ethnic Han Chinese make up 38 percent of the population.
Xinjiang authorities last year stepped up a crackdown on separatists and underground religious activity after clashes, bombings and assassination attempts on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.

The deteriorating health of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping has forced Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin and other leaders to cut short out-of-town trips to return to Beijing, sources said on Monday.
Jiang, who is also state president and head of the army, returned at the weekend, cutting short an unpublicised visit to the communist revolutionary base of Ganzhou in central Jiangxi province, said one Chinese source close to the party.
Premier Li Peng also flew back to Beijing at the weekend, abruptly curtailing a tour of the booming, southern province of Guangdong, said the source, who asked not to be identified.
"Jiang Zemin and Li Peng cut short their trips and rushed back to Beijing because Deng Xiaopings health was deteriorating," the source said.
"They went to see Deng...over the weekend," the source said. "His health is not looking good."
The 92-year-old Deng, whose pragmatic policies transformed a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, lives in a tightly-guarded compound behind the Forbidden City of Chinas emperors in central Beijing.
Diplomats have said one barometer of Dengs health in Chinas highly-secretive system is the travel of top leaders and close family members, with few willing to be out of town or abroad if Deng were close to death.
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing was on a visit to Israel and Iran and Defence Minister Chi Haotian is in the Philippines.
Chinese sources have reported increasing rumours in Beijing in the past few days that Dengs health may be failing.
The State Council, or cabinet, declined on Monday to comment on the rumours.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week Deng was all right for a man of his age.
Hong Kongs Apple Daily newspaper reported at the weekend that the architect of Chinas sweeping economic reforms had been rushed to hospital on Thursday after a massive stroke that followed an earlier, mild stroke.
Rumours about Dengs health surface periodically and Hong Kong stocks tumbled last Friday on one rumour.
Deng has not been seen in public since the 1994 Chinese Lunar New Year festival when he visited Shanghai and appeared frail and faltering. He is now believed to be in fragile health and with fading lucidity.
Chinas elderly leaders exert great influence after their retirement in a society where age is revered and in a communist system in which officials spend years building up a power base.
State-run Chinese media have rarely carried reports on Deng since he vanished from public view, partly because of his failing health and his own desire to retire to play a behind-the-scenes role.
Deng retired from his last official position in 1990 and his only post is honorary chairman of Chinas Bridge Association, a title that reflects his passion for the card game.
Deng was in the public eye at the start of the new year when state television ran a 12-part documentary on his life, but without details of his present circumstances and without interviews with his wife or children.
Western diplomats say the longer Deng lingers the less impact his death will have on the delicate balance of power at the top of Chinas ruling Communist Party.

At least 30 people were killed and dozens more injured in a fire that destroyed a hotel in central China early on Wednesday, with many hurt when they leapt from windows to escape the flames, officials said.
Officials said two people suspected of starting the deadly blaze had been arrested and the manager of the Yanshan Hotel in Changsha, capital of central Hunan province, was on the run.
The fire broke out at about 2.00 a.m. (1800 GMT) in a restaurant on the second floor of the Yanshan Hotel and the flames spread swiftly up to the seventh floor, officials said.
More than 100 people, including the dead, had been taken to hospital by 8.00 a.m., and 30 people were confirmed dead, the official Xinhua news agency said.
A local hospital official said the number of casualties could be much higher.
"We have reports that as many as 200 people may have been killed or injured," an official of the Hunan Number One Hospital said by telephone.
Many guests jumped from windows of the hotel as flames blocked exits on all six of the burning floors, Xinhua said.
About 10 fire engines and 1,000 firemen and rescue workers were sent to rescue hotel guests and to fight the blaze, which took about five hours to extinguish, officials said.
The Hunan Number One hospital had admitted 22 victims, of whom 13 were dead on arrival, most from smoke inhalation, the hospital official said.
"At least eight people were burnt to death at the scene," a local broadcast official said by telephone. "Many more died later in hospital."
Many of the injured were in serious condition.
"In the burns ward we have people who were burnt and we have people with internal injuries from jumping out of upper stories," said a nurse at the Hunan Number Two hospital.
"There are also people with broken bones who jumped out of windows. There are rather a lot of patients with broken bones," she said.
A Changsha government official said police had arrested two people believed to have started the blaze, but it was unclear whether the fire was arson. Police were searching for the hotel manager, who had fled, she said.
Officials said the seven-storey hotel was completely gutted by the fire, the deadliest reported in China since a blaze in December 1994 in a cinema in the northwestern Xinjiang region killed 323 people, most of them children.
"I cycle past the hotel every day to go to work," said one official. "It has been completely burnt."
The number of fire disasters in China in 1996 declined by 3.5 percent compared with the previous year to 36,856, Xinhua quoted an official of the Ministry of Public Security as saying on Wednesday. There were a large number of casualties, the official said, but gave no details.
China implemented safety measures in hotels, restaurants and cinemas in 1995, sharply cutting the number of major fires after a string of fire disasters in 1994 killed 2,600 people and injured 4,000, making it China's deadliest year on record.

UK defence to industrial giant GEC Plc said on Friday that it could impose up to 1,000 job cuts at its two newly-acquired businesses as part of the restructuring process announced in its results statement earlier.
Finance director David Newlands told Reuters that the job losses would hit in AG Power Transmission and Distribution and the Hazeltine Corp of the U.S., particularly the former.
The cost is expected to be 45 million stg of the total 160 million charge revealed earlier. Another 50 million of that total relates to asset write-downs at two other units.  
Newlands refused to name which two companies had seen reduced asset values, but he said that the move was necessary in order to dispose of them.
"We've had many offers for companies in the industrial group over the years - all have been well above the book value, except for these two." He said he expected the first sale of those companies marked for disposal to take place before Christmas.
"We are trying to accelerate the disposal programme. But is takes two to tango," said Newlands, who refused to name the firms. The rest of the 160 million charge announced in Friday's results relates to restructuring within remaining firms.  
On the continuing strategic review, Newlands said "George Simpson (the successor to former managing director Lord Weinstock) arrived in September and has been meeting with managers and getitng on with the task. We expect some announcement before we next speak to analysts in June/July."
He said the group would divest "Where a business is not making satisfactory returns on capital or has satisfactory growth prospects."
Commenting on the sluggish state of the semi-conductor market, which saw lower profits in the first half, Newlands said he did not see a recovery until "spring or summer of next year."
GEC reported a sharp fallback in half year profits on Friday to 261 million stg from 402 million after taking the 160 million charge.
Underlying profits rose just 4.7 percent to 421 million. The interim payout was 3.26 pence versus 3.10 pence. --London newsroom +44 171 5427717

The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions.
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines, final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic, which would create greater competition on the routes.
Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain's Office of Fair Trading, which was asked to examine the case last month.
"I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers, on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S.," he said.
His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed. Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared.
The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport, the busiest in Europe.
American's parent, AMR Corp., said it did not view the terms as a "deal breaker." However, it called the conditions "more severe" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances.
British Airways's initial response was that "unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value." It added that it would be "prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition."
The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes, and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter.
It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route. The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways/American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme.
Lang said responses should be made to the Office of Fair Trading by Jan. 10, 1997.

British Steel saw its share price skid to a 12-month low on Thursday after a rash of profit downgrades from analysts who said the pound's surge against the mark could slash group profitability.
British Steel told Reuters that the pound's advance against the mark was "a concern" and reiterated that it was carrying out a cost-cutting review which could see some jobs being axed as a result of the currency factor.
Analysts at Natwest Markets cut their profit forecast for the current year and joined Merrill Lynch and SocGen in halving profit predictions for the year after, ending March 1998.
All three blamed sterling's relentless rise against the mark and said that not only were exports to Europe in danger, but imports to Britain were also on the up as customers chose the cheaper option.
One analyst said "I think the pound will stay around the 2.60 Deutschemark level. The mark-based steel market is a big European market and the current exchange rate makes British Steel look expensive not just abroad but at home as well.
"British Steel is being hit on both fronts."
The British group's shares are currently trading at 151- 1/2 pence per share, down two and a half pence on the day. The shares have not been this low since January 1996 and have retreated from a high of 201-1/2.
Merrill analyst Paul Compton said the pretax profit downgrade on Wednesday to 280 million pounds from 650 million for the year to March 1998 was purely due to the potential impact of the UK currency.
"British Steel was probably using 2.30 (marks) to the pound for 1996/97," said Compton. "In 1997/98 it now looks like they will have to raise it to as much as 2.65 marks and the impact is around 350 million (on profits)."
Sterling is currently trading around the highest levels seen since it exited the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in late 1992. When Merrill made its forecast downgrade on Wednesday, the currency was trading at around 2.65 marks to the pound and $1.69.
SocGen analyst Andy Chambers told Reuters he had cut the British Steel pretax profit figures for the year to March 1998 to 400 million pounds from 700 million.
Industry sources said Natwest Markets had gone further by slashing the current year pretax profit forecast to March 1997 to 477 million pounds from 611 million. Natwest has cut its forecast for the following year to 355 million from 449.
All analysts reported that British Steel would be hit in European export markets which are mark/pound sensitive and that as the pound gains ground, the domestic market has also become vulnerable with customers buying cheaper imports.
Of British Steel's eight billion pounds in sales, the company said 50 percent is exported.
A spokesman for the steel giant said that up to three billion pounds of its total sales are sensitive to the pound/mark exchange rate.

Britain was a step closer to completing the privatisation of passenger rail services on Thursday after announcing the preferred bidders for two more franchises which helped send the companies' shares soaring.
The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) said Great Western Holdings Ltd had been chosen as the preferred bidder for the North West Regional Railways franchise in northwest England.
Existing management and employees own 51 percent of the bid group, with FirstBus and 3i venture capital owning 24.5 percent each.
The Thameslink franchise was awarded to GOVIA which comprises of Go-Ahead Group Plc and French transport group VIA-GTI.
That leaves just three of the total 25 franchises to be awarded ahead of the deadline for the British election due by May 1997. Apart from the franchise for routes in Central England, the remaining deals are ScotRail and North East Regional Rail.
The franchise sales will completes the controversial privatisation of Britain's rail industry which began in 1995 and included the sell-off of rail infrastructure under Railtrack and the sale of the three rolling stock leasing companies.
Go-Ahead's commercial director Chris Moyes welcomed the news and told Reuters the line had huge potential because it provided a link from the financial district of London to Gatwick and Luton airports.
He said finalisation of the deal could add 100 million pounds ($162 million) of extra revenue to Go-Ahead's figures.
"We aim to capitalise on our existing commuter traffic and improve the links to the airports. There is enormous scope," he said pointing to the example of the fast-link Gatwick Express service from Victoria which serves the West London travellers.
Opraf also announced that a revised shortlist for Central Trains had been drawn up, cutting the orignal list of five to National Express Group and Straightforward Lines which contains FirstBus and the existing management team.
FirstBus chairman, Trevor Smallwood, said whoever won the Central deal, which covers routes in central England, could see revenues of around 70 million pounds.
His company must now make renewed presentations against National Express in a fight to the finish.
A final decision is expected in the next two weeks when financial details of each deal will be revealed including the service, investment and subsidy levels for the franchise term.
The latest round of winners saw their shares roar ahead in celebration, with Go-Ahead leading the pack with a 36 pence rise to 515 by the close. National Express was up 26 pence at 547 and FirstBus was up 12 1/2 pence at 241.
The sector has seen spectacular growth in share prices in the past year as more bus operators have moved into railways, taking advantage of the opportunities opened up by privatisation.

The British government warned on Friday it would refer the proposed transatlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers accepted a number of conditions.
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions are met by both airlines, final clearance will hinge on an open skies deal being signed between the British and U.S. governments to liberalise transatlantic air traffic -- securing greater competition on the routes.
Lang backed conditions proposed by competition watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading, which was asked to re-examine the case last month.
He said in a statement, "I agree...that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers, on those routes where BA and AA (American) currently compete and for all passengers on the transatlantic route between the UK and U.S."
The comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London, with no deal signed. Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the BA/American deal would be cleared.
Both BA and American were both forming a response to the news and were unavailable to give an immmediate reaction.
The conditions for clearance of the alliance are that BA and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport, the busiest in Europe.
The government also wants BA to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir which bars it from competing on transatlantic routes.
Also, both BA and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas Ft Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter, because it was felt by the OFT that competition on this route would be hampered by an alliance.
The OFT has called for BA/American to allow third party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent scheme.
Lang said responses should be made to the OFT by 1700 GMT on January 10 1997.
But Will Whitehorn, spokesman for Virgin Atlantic Airways, a major rival on the UK-U.S. route, said "I don't think they will be able to meet these conditions. I think it will go to the MMC...even if they complied with the conditions the alliance would still be anti-competitive."
On the open skies talks, Whitehorn said that by linking the deal's clearance to an open skies pact, the British government was using its leverage to try and gain reciprocal access for British carriers into the restricted U.S. internal market.
United Airlines said it thought the OFT conditions imposed on the alliance were in step with its own views.
The current aviation agreement, dating back to March 1991, restricts transatlantic access to Heathrow to BA, American, Virgin Atlantic Airways and United Airlines.
The DOT has refused to comment on whether it will now be seeking to set a date for new open skies talks bearing in mind the OFT stipulation that alliance clearance hinges on transatlantic flight liberalisation.
Under the BA/American alliance, BA would coordinate its 244 flights a week to 22 U.S. destinations with American's 238 flights from seven U.S. airports to 12 European destinations.

Britain cleared CE Electric's 782 million pound ($1.3 billion) bid for regional electricity company (Rec) Northern Electric on Friday and analysts said the U.S. firm was now likely to net its prize.
"I think CE Electric will probably win, they already have 29 percent from the market in their back pocket, they have to be in pole position," said Nigel Hawkins of Yamaichi.
Trade and industry minister Ian Lang said in a statement approving the bid that CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by U.S.-based CalEnergy, had given assurances addressing regulatory concerns including guarantees on Northern's financial and management resources.
CE Electric raised its bid to 650 pence per share from a previous 630 pence on December 6 and slapped a deadline of December 20 on acceptances. Northern has said the bid undervalues the company and that a price of 700 pence per share was indicated in talk
Northern says it has the backing of major investor Prudential Corporation, which owns more than 11 percent of its shares and has bought more at 600 pence apiece.
Prudential traditionally tends to back the target company's board in a hostile takeover situation. But in the latest war of words, CE Electric said it also had major investors on its side and was confident of victory.
"I believe investors will now back the offer. They have seen it cleared and there is no white knight (bidder) on the horizon. We are now confident of getting above the 50 percent threshold," said David Sokol, CE Electric's chairman and chief executive.
Northern shares jumped on news of the deal being cleared, rising 42-1/2p to close at 645p after sluggish sessions on concerns that the bid could be blocked.
But Northern's latest rebuttal said acceptance would mean shareholders "giving up almost one pound per share in dividends over the next nine months and to forego a prospective 1997/98 yield of over 10.5 percent," after it forecast a final dividend for this year of 50 pence, up 17 percent.
"We think 650 pence still undervalues Northern, but with the market currently looking so jittery and the political atmosphere possibly changing, investors might find the offer very attractive," said one analyst who asked not to be named.
A general election is due within five months and the opposition Labour party, which is riding high in polls, has promised to introduce a one-off windfall tax on utilities and could also tighten up pricing regulation.
In its defence, Northern has outlined plans to realise value by merging its electricity and gas supply businesses with another regional player and it wants to develop a 50 megawatt gas-fired power station in a joint venture with Rolls Royce.
Everything now hangs on next Friday, with both sides keeping up the campaign to clinch support from big investors.
CE Electric has just under 30 percent of shares in the bag and four percent of acceptances, needing 50 percent of Northern shares to win.
Northern had already escaped the clutches of one predator -- conglomerate Trafalgar House -- last year, with a defence package totalling 560 million pounds. ($1=.6043 Pound)

Tomkins Plc, the UK conglomerate with businesses spanning baking to engineering, is expected to sees a rise in half year pretax profits on Monday amid some market speculation that it could announce a share buyback.
Analysts were mostly predicting six month profits of around 160 million stg from 126.1 million in the previous year. The average forecast for the half year payout was 3.0 pence per share from 2.70 pence last time.  
The shares have recently seen brisk gains following a "buy" recommendation from Kleinwort Benson analysts. Tomkins was also listed as one of the nine stocks to buy in 1997 by Credit Lyonnais Laing. Shares are currently at 278 pence, down two pence.
Another reason for Tomkins' recent gains has been some market speculation about a possible share buyback. The group board obtained permission for a buyback of up to 10 percent of its shares in 1995 and currently has around 400 million stg in cash.  
But Ian Rennardson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said the group had given no indications since that it may launch a buyback at the interim stage. Other analysts are also sceptical.
Rennardson sees interim profits at 160 million stg and expects a solid trading performance. "This is a stock within a sector which has seen real underperformance. Tomkins has the best earnings, dividends and cashflow and after the Gates (Corp) deal, the shares are still looking reasonably cheap."
Another analyst, predicting the same profit levels, said investors would be looking for an update on Gates since its acquisition last summer for $1 bln.  
Gates is an automotive and components company.
Sterling is not expected to deal a blow to the Tomkins results this time round, said one analyst.  "Sterling will in fact benefit the year ending April 1997 as Tomkins has locked in (foreign exchange cover) at $1.52 to the pound," he said.
He anticipates a solid U.S. performance, with a slightly subdued UK market and continued good cash generation.

Go-Ahead Group Plc, the UK transport company, and its French partner VIA-GTI are set to be announced as the preferred bidder for the Thameslink passenger rail franchise, industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.
An official announcement is expected from the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) imminently.
The joint venture, which is 65 percent owned by Go-Ahead and 35 percent by the VIA-GTI, is called GOVIA.  
Go-Ahead has already won the Thames rail franchise and GOVIA had been shortlisted for Thameslink, as well as ScotRail and Regional Railways North East.
The Thameslink rail franchise runs to Luton and Gatwick airports through the financial district of London and is seen as having great potential as a fast-link to these major UK airports.
Go-Ahead is a bus and rail operator. As well as becoming a player in the rail franchise market, it also has around eight percent of the UK bus market, with fleets running in London, Oxford and the north east of England.
The group has been among a number of UK bus companies to move into rail, fuelling growth in earnings, which has triggered a strong rise in its share price.

Anglo-American conglomerate Hanson Plc set the date for the final stage of its ambitious four-way demerger on Tuesday with the announcement that its Energy Group division will be spun off on February 24.
Energy Group, which is mulling a string of acquisitions in Britain and America, said it had started talks with a U.S. power marketing company.
The demerger, which is subject to shareholder approval, will give shareholders one Energy share for every 10 existing Hanson shares held. Hanson shareholders will be asked to vote on the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on February 21.
Once Energy is split off as a separate company, to be listed in London and New York, the rump Hanson group will consist of a clutch of building firms.
"We are all very enthusiastic about the future of Energy and new Hanson and are convinced that both will benefit from enhanced focus on operations, profitability and future growth prospects," chairman Lord Hanson said.
The first two demergers of Britain's Imperial Tobacco and U.S.-quoted Millennium Chemicals took place last October.
Energy, which will be large enough to rank inside Britain's top 100 blue chips and the Fortune 500 in the U.S., is the last to be split off.
Its new management team is led by Derek Bonham, executive chairman, with two joint chief executives to run operations at the main businesses -- Peabody mining and Eastern, the British electricity division.
Bonham told a press briefing the group planned to target a number of acquisitions, particularly in the U.S., and admitted entering into "exclusive and confidential" talks with a U.S. power marketing company, subject to due diligence.
It is also examining generating deals in the U.S. and Britian, it said.
Peabody chief executive Irl Engelhardt told a press briefing that the coal group could use its knowledge of the U.S. market to help Energy exploit opportunities there.
Group finance director Eric Anstee said the group would "take the cash generation of the coal and network businesses and use it where we see future growth in earnings -- the growing power sector".
Eastern generated a total of 354 million pounds ($571 million) in cash flow in the year ended September 30, he said.
Energy, which owns Eastern, Britain's fourth largest electricity generator, said that worldwide demand for energy is expected to rise 34 to 46 percent between 1993 and 2010.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, world electricity output is expected to grow 63 percent to 2010. Coal and gas will account for 41 percent and 17 percent of that generation level by 2010.
Energy, which is being sold with 1.4 billion pounds of debt, sees this, deregulation in world markets and privatisation as the key opportunities for the group.
Investor roadshows are being planned on both sides of the Atlantic, with 35 percent of Hanson's shares held in the U.S.
The group's annual turnover in the year to September 30, 1996 was 3.6 billion pounds, with pre-exceptional profits of 446 million pounds. Total assets are 5.7 billion pounds. ($1=.6199 Pound)

Northern England's glittering record of inward investment was tarnished this week by news of 1,300 jobs being axed at Ford Motor Co's Halewood plant, denting the region's record of attracting foreign firms.
Cheap local labour, flexible employment rules and government laws to keep trade unions on a tight leash have all combined to entice foreign investors into northern England.
The long list includes companies like Japan's Nissan Motor Co, Germany's Siemens, South Korea's Samsung Co and General Motor Co's British unit Vauxhall.
Prime Minister John Major said the cuts went against the trend. Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke was more philosophical, saying on Thursday: "You can't win them all."
Professor Charles Bean of the London School of Economics, said Major's decision to stay out of the European Union's Social Chapter employment protection meant: "We have low firing costs.
"So foreign companies are more likely to create jobs here when times are good and axe them in the UK first when times get tough."
But business chiefs in other northern regions were keen to play up the investment bonanza they have enjoyed.
Northern Development Co spokeswoman Christine Kennedy said in an interview: "Foreign investment has provided the building blocks for a regeneration in the north," after traditional industries like mining and shipbuilding declined.
Local business leaders in the north west of England also stressed that the Ford move was a one-off set against a good track record of inward investment within the region as a whole.
Inward', the north west's corporate development body, said that 2,600 jobs were created in the region in the financial year 1995/96.
Thirty one companies invested capital expenditure of 117.3 million pounds ($196.2 million) in the north west of England including the television shopping channel QVC which will create 1,100 jobs in Knowsley, Liverpool. That figure is seen doubling by 1998.
Liverpool Chamber of Commerce policy executive Peter Rigby, told Reuters that the discovery of oil and gas in Liverpool Bay was another bonus which could give the region a slice of up to 2,000 jobs from oil companies operating in the area.
Merseyside qualifies for an EU grant of 630 million pounds to boost employment because its GDP is one of Europe's poorest at 73 percent of the European average.
Rigby admits that Ford's job cuts were a blow, coupled with news that Manchester airport beaten Liverpool in getting the go-ahead for a second runway for its airport. This dashed hopes of 20,000 Liverpool airport-related jobs being created in construction, support staff and service industries.
Manchester airport will benefit instead, creating an estimated 50,000 new jobs.
Hardest hit in the region is the small Merseyside community of Speke, where the Halewood factory is based. It has one of the highest unemployment levels in Britain and has failed to enjoy a foreign-led renaissance.
Jobless rates in Speke already run as high as 39 percent in some council estates, compared to more than 11 percent in Liverpool and 6.7 percent nationally.
The Ford job cuts are seen triggering up to 1,200 job losses elsewhere in supplier anmd service industries.
The Speke community is seeing other businesses like banks and supermarkets shut down and move away as employers pull out.
One resident, Nicky McDonagh said after the Ford news: "The place is bad enough as it is -- it will just lead to more crime. Unemployment's already high -- most children leave school with no job prospects. I just want to get out now." ($1=.5979 Pound)

WavePhore Inc on Monday unveiled a service that broadcasts data to home personal computers via television signals, allowing users to bypass bottlenecks in the Internet.
The company said its WaveTop service will broadcast entertainment and information programming nationwide through TV signals, side-stepping the clogged phone lines and overstrained computer networks that slow Internet connections.
"We think we can complement the Internet beautifully," said Sandy Goldman, WavePhore's consumer unit vice president.  
Initially, the WaveTop system will carry stereo broadcasts of a music radio station, real-time news, educational programs for children, and new and updated software to home PCs -- all without interrupting ongoing activities on the computer, the Phoenix-based company said.
Once it begins U.S. operations in September, WaveTop will represent the first wireless data broadcast medium delivering audio, video, software and real-time data to home PCs, Goldman told Reuters in a recent interview.  
"This gets past the bottleneck of the phone line being busy," said Gary Arlen, a veteran online industry analyst who heads Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.
The system will be free to consumers who own a broadcast-ready personal computer equipped with a TV tuner, a device that several top computer makers plan to integrate into their machines this year. TV tuners now add $99 to $150 to the cost of a PC, but prices are falling.
WaveTop is to be advertiser-supported. It may also provide consumers with optional higher value, pay-per-use services.  
Arlen said the system is well suited for transmitting information that does not require instant feedback. "For a lot of Web surfing, all you need is a way of quickly accessing things that are floating through the wires anyway," he said.
WavePhore's system operates by embedding data into a portion of existing TV signals. The company has a pact with the Public Broadcasting Service's 250 local stations to broadcast via an unused portion of their signals.  
This high-speed, point-to-multi-point service will have the capacity to reach more than 99 percent of U.S. television households simultaneously and is capable of being extended to Canada over the Canadian Broadcasting Corp's TV network.
"It's a network infrastructure that's already in place," said Joel Krasner of brokerage firm Southcoast Capital, the one Wall Street analyst who formally WavePhore.
"You don't have to have people using cable modems or fiber optic cables," Krasner said. He was referring to other, more costly delivery methods capable of speeding Internet delivery using phone and cable TV technologies.  
Goldman said the WaveTop network plans to offer one radio station in 1997 and three by 1998, playing a choice of rock, classical music and jazz.
KidsTop, aimed at children, will deliver educational programming developed by the Public Broadcasting Service and others, Goldman said.
For news, the company said it plans to negotiate deals with media companies such as Dow Jones &amp; Co and Reuters Holdings Plc, offering a slimmed-down version of what it already offers on its professional investor network, he said.  
Both Dow and Reuters declined comment.
WavePhore already carries Dow and Reuters news on its professional investor network.
Goldman said WavePhore has few information content partnerships to announce at this stage but is in talks with content providers for each of the seven services WaveTop will offer.
Goldman said the company expects to sign these deals ahead of the formal launch of the service in September.
WavePhore said a recent study by the technology research firm Yankee Group estimated that by the year 2000, nearly 20 million U.S. households will have PCs capable of receiving data embedded in a TV signal.
WavePhore's strategy has been embraced by computer industry leaders Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and Compaq Computer Corp. All three are developing enabling technology to support the integration of home computer and TV technologies.
Krasner believes WavePhore may strike a deal with Pointcast Inc, a Web-based information broadcaster. The two companies already work together to provide information to corporate subscribers, he said.

AT&amp;T Corp. said Monday its first-quarter profits fell 17 percent, trimmed by competition in long-distance services and investments in new businesses, and warned second quarter results might be weak as well.
Meanwhile, BellSouth Corp., a consistent top performer among regional telephone companies, said its operating earnings rose 11 percent due to a rise in the number of customer lines and strong growth in its wireless operations.
AT&amp;T said it earned $1.13 billion, or 69 cents a share, on revenues of $13.05 billion, down from net income of $1.36 billion, or 85 cents a share, on revenues of $12.85 billion in the first quarter of 1996.
AT&amp;T's earnings per share for the first quarter were in line with Wall Street's expectations based on previous guidance the company had provided financial analysts.
"Results are where we expected them to be as we implement our strategy," Chairman Robert Allen said in a statement.
In a conference call Monday, AT&amp;T also warned that its second quarter results were likely to be weaker than the first quarter but that its expectations for the full year remained on track.
Several Wall Street analysts said they planned to reduce their earnings estimates for the remainder of the year.
"There was not a great deal to cheer in the results," Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Klugman said.
AT&amp;T's first quarter revenue increase was driven by growth in local telephone service and other initiatives, business long-distance services and wireless services. That was partially offset by declines in financial services and consumer long-distance revenues, the company said.
AT&amp;T said long-distance calling volume in the most recent quarter increased by 6.7 percent over the same period of 1996, but revenue from those services rose only 0.6 percent to $11.51 billion.
Volume from consumer long-distance was flat and revenue fell 1 percent to $6.06 billion, the company said. Revenue from business long-distance rose 2.4 percent on a double-digit increase in volume.
AT&amp;T said expansion in online, local and international operations reduced its quarterly per share income by 25 cents. A year earlier, those expenses reduced earnings by 10 cents a share, AT&amp;T said.
Atlanta-based BellSouth said it earned $693 million, or 70 cents a share, on revenues of $4.8 billion in the three months ended March 31, slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations.
A year earlier the company earned $626 million, or 63 cents a share, before a one-time gain of $344 million, or 35 cents a share, on the sale of paging operations.
Revenues were $4.5 billion in the 1996 quarter.
"BellSouth's 17th consecutive quarter of improved operating results was driven by our innovative marketing," said Chief Executive Officer Duane Ackerman, adding that, "Sales increased across the board."
The company said the number of customer lines increased by 379,000 -- the biggest gain for any quarter in its history, breaking the old mark of 359,000 set in the first quarter of 1996. BellSouth now has a total of 22.5 milllion access lines.
BellSouth said the company's U.S. cellular operations ended the first quarter with 3.8 million customers, reflecting an annual growth rate of 24 percent. In international cellular markets, customers rose 76 percent since the first quarter of 1996, reaching 1.5 million.
"These are just blistering numbers," Montgomery Securities analyst Bill Vogel said of BellSouth's growth in customer access lines and the value-added services like Caller ID and Call Waiting the company offers in addition to basic access.
"They not only have the access lines growing, but the services on those lines growing sharply," he said.
Vogel, who maintains a "buy" rating on the stock, said he expected BellSouth earnings to accelerate beyond the 11 percent rise seen in the first quarter as the company benefits from rising growth in new services.
BellSouth stock was down $1.125 at $39.875 and AT&amp;T stock was off 75 cents at $32.875, both in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The proposed $6.6 billion acquisition of modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp. by computer network equipment manufacturer 3Com Corp. triggered a drop Thursday in the stocks of 3Com, U.S. Robotics and other major network companies.
Santa Clara, Calif.-based 3Com's stock fell $4 to $35 and was the most heavily traded issue on Nasdaq, with more than 40 million shares changing hands. U.S. Robotics dropped $1.875 to $59.125, also on Nasdaq, and was the second-most active share.
Analysts said the proposed stock swap unveiled Wednesday undervalued Skokie, Ill.-based U.S. Robotics, the world's leading maker of computer modems for the consumer market.
"I think U.S. Robotics shareholders are being robbed," said Donaldson Lufkin analyst Eric Buck, who harshly criticised the terms of the deal.
Several analysts said the offer -- involving stock and options valued at $7.3 billion in all -- put a low-ball value on U.S. Robotics of 20 times annual earnings vs. its historic multiple of 25.
"If anything, this deal is more of a take-under than a takeover," Salomon analyst Peter Swartz said of the 3Com deal. "Both stocks are down 50 percent from their highs." Swartz noted that many network stocks are trading at historic lows.
The merger, if approved by shareholders and government regulators, would create a combined company with $5 billion in annual revenues and 12,000 employees -- second only to leader Cisco Systems Inc. with more than $6 billion in annual revenues. The merger also comes as the Internet and other computer networks continue to grow in importance.
Analysts said the deal put pressure on other network equipment players to use their shares to fund major acquisitions of their own.
"We believe the competitive landscape of the networking sector is undergoing a fundamental restructuring," J.P. Morgan analyst Bill Rabin said in published comments. "Other networking vendors will have to combine or be bought."
Along with 3Com and U.S. Robotics, network company stocks were among the most actively traded on Nasdaq Thursday.
Cisco Systems fell $3.06 to $55.06, Ascend Communications Inc. dropped $5.375 to $57, and Cascade Communications Corp. slipped $2.50 to $30.125.
Still, Rabin reiterated "buy" ratings on four stocks in the sector, while maintaining his "market perform" rating on 3Com. Swartz also kept his "buy" rating and recommended investors buy 3Com shares while the price is low.
The main beneficiaries of the 3Com-Robotics deal appeared to be Bay Networks Inc. and Shiva Corp. -- two stocks that have sat in the doghouse for some time -- based on their potential as acquisition targets, analysts said.
Shiva rose 62.5 cents to $15.875 on Nasdaq, recovering from its historic low, while Bay added 12.5 cents to $19.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"The merger forces other players in the industry to ante up to play in this bigger game," said Steve Harmon, an independent financial analyst who publishes the Internet Stock Report.
"It forces equipment makers to look for end-to-end solutions supplying network products to both businesses and consumers," he said, referring to how the 3Com-Robotics merger would allow the combined company to compete in both markets.
The pressure to do deals adds to the burdens already weighing on the computer network industry, analysts said.
Earnings shortfalls or close calls, fears of slowing industry growth and cautionary comments from 3Com, Cascade and Shiva have triggered fears about the whole sector, Rabin said.
In addition, technology changes in the industry and the growing threat of competition from outsiders like chip makers Intel Corp. and Rockwell International Corp. have dimmed the outlook for the industry as a whole.
Some analysts cited fears that Intel may decide to integrate network adapter cards or modem chips directly into the computer chassis it builds, rendering stand-alone products from many network suppliers a commodity -- if not obsolete.

A group of 28 computer and communications equipment makers -- missing a major modem manufacturer -- Wednesday announced a coalition to develop a common standard for a new generation of faster modems running at speeds up to 56 kilobits per second.
Missing from the coalition was U.S. Robotics Corp., the industry's leading maker of consumer modems and the company credited with pioneering development of 56-kilobit modems, which began shipping its products earlier this week.
U.S. Robotics and 3Com Corp. later announced that 3Com would buy U.S. Robotics in a deal valued at $6.6 billion.
Faster modems will dramatically cut the time it takes to access a Web page or download software to a personal computer. The 56-kilobit-per-second speed would effectively double the speed of current 28.8-kilobit-per-second modems.
The standards group is backed by other makers of modems and related products like Rockwell International Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc. and Motorola Inc.
Backers of the industry standards effort, to be known as the Open 56 Forum, include leading data and telecommunications equipment makers, semiconductor suppliers and personal computer manufacturers.
Twenty-eight companies in all signed up initially. In a conference call, supporters of the initiative said the forum would welcome the participation of any company willing to create interoperable 56-kilobit modems, including U.S. Robotics.
"We have approached U.S. Robotics directly ... to join," said David Mays, an official at Ascend Communications Inc., a driving force behind the effort to create a common standard.
But before industry unification can be achieved, the standards-setting group may have to do a better job of encouraging key industry players to participate.
A spokeswoman for U.S. Robotics said the company was first invited to join the Open 56K Forum less than one hour before the group's announcement was released Wednesday afternoon.
Asked if U.S. Robotics would consider joining the Open 56K Forum, spokeswoman Sarah Powers responded, "Definitely. We are actively seeking interoperability" in the industry.
She said Robotics was actively considering participating in the forum's first meeting, slated to be held March 27.
While Robotics is the first to ship actual products, several vendors have said they plan to ship products in March.
For example, Motorola introduced two 56-kilobit modems Wednesday, the Modemsurfr 56K and the Voicesurfr 56K. A spokeswoman said the modems will be available by mid-March.
Until an industrywide standard is created, modems from each supplier will remain incompatible when communicating with modems offered by other suppliers.
There is wide agreement within the industry that failure to agree on a common standard will create confusion among consumers, delaying acceptance of the higher-speed technology.

International Business Machines Corp gave its stock a cosmetic boost with a two-for-one split Tuesday, but the luster it gave the stock may prove fleeting unless IBM can revive core business growth.
"The company's management must show how they can deliver sustained growth again before people will say 'IBM is healed,'" Nomura Securities analyst Daniel Ries said.
Nonetheless, IBM surged to 153, up 7-5/8 points, reversing a 25-point slide the stock has endured in the past week since signs of slower growth emerged in its fourth quarter results.  
Analysts and traders said the timing of the split coincided with an analyst upgrade by Salomon Brothers and took advantage of what many investors considered the stock's oversold condition after the recent sell-off.
"IBM did the right thing: they split the stock right on top of Solly's upgrade," said one trader, referring to Salomon analyst John Jones' move to upgrade IBM stock to strong buy.
"People were looking for an entry point -- they found it," he said.  
IBM's more than seven point gain contributed over 22 points to the Dow's 84 point rise Tuesday afternoon, due to the stock's heavy weighting in calculating the 30-stock index.
While the stock split was largely seen as numerical window-dressing -- doubling the number of shares traded while halving the price into the $70s of each post-split share -- the split has subtle psychological implications for investors.
Besides the initial boost that typically accompanies share splits, the move may reduce investors' focus on the psychologically important level of 175.  
That's IBM's historic high share price, reached in 1987, and a level the computer maker's shares had flirted near, but never quite reached, prior to last week's selloff.
The higher share activity should help dramatize daily movements in the stock and lift total volumes to the lofty levels seen by Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp, which can often top 10 million shares traded.
One tangible benefit of the split may be to heighten retail investor interest in the stock.  By cutting the investment necessary to buy a "round lot" of 100 shares, the stock may appear more affordable to smaller investors.  
But securities analysts said the stock split move does nothing to stoke the main engine for further stock price gains -- core business growth.
"The significant move upward in the second half of 1996 was based on the people becoming convinced that IBM could sustain growth of eight to 10 percent," Nomura's Ries said.
IBM shares gained more than 60 points in the second half of 1996, reaching as high as 170 in December.
But disappointing growth in fourth quarter hardware sales and continued economic sluggishness in European markets led Wall Street to slash ratings.
The company had told analysts that hardware sales grew only two percent during the final quarter of 1996.
"Not a big deal," said Soundview Financial analyst Gary Helmig of the share split, noting that the principal effect should be to double the daily share volume of IBM, which previously has averaged about four five million shares a day.
"There's no real reason for them to do this, but it does tend to make the stock go up," he said.

Computer network company 3Com Corp. will acquire modem giant U.S. Robotics in a deal valued at $6.6 billion, the companies said Wednesday, in a deal that would create a counterweight to industry powerhouse Cisco Systems Inc.
The merger -- the largest ever in the computer network industry -- will create a company with more than $5 billion in annual revenues and more than 12,000 employees in 130 countries, U.S. Robotics and 3Com said.
Under terms of the deal announced after markets closed, each share of U.S. Robotics will be swapped for 1.75 shares of 3Com. The deal is valued at $6.6 billion based on the $39.125 Tuesday closing price of 3Com stock, the companies said.
3Com closed Wednesday down 12.5 cents at $39 and U.S. Robotics was down 50 cents at $61, both on Nasdaq.
The companies said the merger would create a company that would provide end-to-end equipment for computer networks.
U.S. Robotics, based in Skokie, Ill., is the world's largest maker of consumer modems, which enable personal computer users to connect to the Internet and online services and to send and receive faxes from their PCs. Santa Clara, Calif.-based 3Com is one of the biggest computer networking companies.
Industry analysts were divided over whether the merger of two of the top six network equipment suppliers would be enough to offer one-stop shopping for network equipment on the scale of No. 1 company Cisco Systems Inc.
"No more 'Cisco and the Seven Dwarfs'," Bear, Stearns analyst Eric Blachno said, invoking a nickname frequently heard in the industry to describe Cisco's dominant position. "It appears the Cisco has acquired a large competitor."
Veteran industy analyst Frank Dzubeck, however, questioned the viability of combining the two companies in light of precedents set by previous mega-mergers in the industry.
"This could be another Bay-Wellfleet-Synoptics deal," he said, referring to the 1994 merger that formed Bay Networks Inc. That merger ran into problems over conflicts in combining product lines, company cultures and management teams, analysts have said.
The U.S. Robotics-3Com deal calls for 3Com Chairman Eric Benhamou to remain chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company. U.S. Robotics Chairman and Chief Executive Casey Cowell will join 3Com's board as vice chairman.
"The combination of 3Com and U.S. Robotics dramatically alters the networking landscape with the industry's broadest set of innovative, feature-rich network access solutions," said Benhamou. "Together, with an installed base of over 100 million network connections, we can offer network users the fastest access to their local and wide area networks.
Cowell said, "By providing faster, more intelligent, and easier-to-use products for connecting the broadest array of users to local and wide area networks, we can accelerate the deployment of networking worldwide."
Cowell founded the company in 1976 with four college friends, working day and night in a windowless workroom above a military surplus store in Chicago.
U.S. Robotics, known for its Sportster and Courier modems and for being the first to market with 56-kilobit-per-second modem technology, became the darling of Wall Street in its relatively short stint, taking advantage of the Internet craze of the 1990s.
"They've become the bride, one of the most prized catches of networking," said Amar Senan, an analyst for investment bankers Volpe, Welty &amp; Co.
"They've come from a humble analogue company to one of the most formidable networking companies," Senan said. "They started with 300 (bits per second) modems" and just this week shipped their first 56 kilobit "x2" modems.
The company's first modems were sold under the names of Apple Computer Inc. and Commodore Computers. In 1987, the company began to focus on selling its own brand of products and posted revenues of $21 million. For fiscal 1996 which ended on Sept. 30, U.S. Robotics reported revenues of $1.98 billion.
U.S. Robotics went public in October of 1991 at $13 a share. After stock splits, a $1,000 investment made in 1991 is worth about $30,000, Cowell said.

America Online Inc. said Tuesday it planned to place advertising on company-sponsored discussion areas, or "chat groups," as part of the world's largest online service's bid to expand its revenue base beyond mainly subscriber fees.
The Dulles, Va.-based company said placing ads in the company-sponsored chat rooms would generate 360 million ad "impressions" every month, a programme one analyst estimated could generate $15 million to $25 million in new revenues in 1997. Impressions, or how many times an ad is viewed, are the advertising industry's standard way of measuring the impact of individual ad promotions.
America Online stock rose $3.75 to $43.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. That rise followed a gain of $2.50 on Monday.
"AOL has the largest online chat community in the universe," Bob Pittman, the president of America Online Networks, the company's main operating unit, said in a statement.
"Over 70 percent of our members chat and we log 1 million hours of chat every day, a figure that has more than doubled over the last six months," he said.
Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Oakes estimated "chat rooms" account for about 23 percent of online usage time among America Online subscribers.
Oakes said America Online places ads on less than 4 percent of the screens its subscribers view, marking it as a significant revenue growth opportunity for the company.
If ads ran on all interactive services on America Online, including chat, electronic mail, special interest bulletin boards and its "instant messages" subscriber messaging system, America Online could book as much as $500 million in advertising revenues, he said.
America Online's chat area, known as "People Connection," creates up to 14,000 virtual chat rooms with up to 23 people in one area.
Advertisements would rotate every 60 seconds, utilizing America Online's new software ad delivery technology, the company said.
The ads will run in company-sponsored chat rooms like Town Square (current events), Life, Romance, Special Interest, Places, Arts &amp; Entertainment, and News, Sports &amp; Finance. Advertising will not be targeted at private chat rooms created by members themselves, the company said.
As an example, Oakes said sponsored chat rooms could include a Michael Jordan chat session with his fans, sponsored by Nike, or a health care discussion, sponsored by Johnson &amp; Johnson.
Daytime TV talk show host Rosie O'Donnell's recent appearance set a record on America Online with more than 16,000 simultaneous participants signing on during the programme, he said.
Adding advertising to chat rooms represents America Online's latest bid to boost revenues from sources other than subscriber fees.
Last week, America Online announced a deal with Tel-Save Holdings Inc., a long distance phone service provider, in which America Online received a $100 million payment from Tel-Save to market its long-distance services to America Online members.
The online service has said it expected an increasing portion of its revenues to come from ads instead of just subcriber fees as it grows beyond its roots as an online access company to become a diversified media company.
"This is yet another asset that we have that will allow America Online to capture an ever larger percentage of online and Internet advertising spending," Pittman said of the plan to mix advertising with online chat sessions.
America Online is the world's largest Internet online service with about 8 million members.

3Com Corp Chairman Eric Benhamou said he plans to use the company's proposed merger with U.S. Robotics Corp to expand the reach of 3Com's office-oriented equipment into small business and home markets.
In a telephone interview Wednesday evening after the announcement of the $7.3-billion-merger (on a fully-diluted basis), Benhamou said a key force behind the deal was the prospect of enlarging the market for its corporate network equipment into retail sales channels.
As the leading supplier of modems, U.S. Robotics' strong presence in retail outlets can be used to propel sales of 3Com's core network adapter card business, he said.
3Com is by far the world's dominant supplier of adapters, or network interface cards (NICs), used to link personal computers to networks.
"Our OfficeConnect product line is perfect for the retail market," Benhamou said, referring to products it introduced in 1996 that repackage its other corporate office equipment -- hubs, switches and routers -- for small business and home users.
OfficeConnect products link the computers, printers, modems and telephones found in home offices in a low-cost network.  
Benhamou also sees opportunities to sell U.S. Robotics modem products for desktop and laptop computers to corporate offices using 3Com's 500-strong enterprise sales force.
"We will just leverage Robotics strength in retail outlets," he said in reference to his plan to shoe horn 3Com equipment into consumer markets that -- until the recent demand explosion for Internet links -- was largely confined to office networks.
"(The new demand for network connections) even reaches into your shirt pocket with products like Pilot," he said. Pilot, a product 3Com will acquire in the merger, is a shirt-pocket sized personal information organizer that offers ties to the Internet.
Further growth will come from Robotics efforts to develop higher speed modems like the 56 kilobit ones it introduced on Monday and future cable modem and digital subscriber line modems that transit up to six megabits per second.
He said the merger would also give 3Com access to a growing base of telco carrier customers who use Robotics hubs equipment to provide Internet dial-up services, saving 3Com from having to invest on its own to enter the Wide Area Network (WAN) market.  
Robotics focuses heavily on WANs, providing equipment for both ends of an Internet connection: modems for consumers and hub connections for service providers. Fifty percent of its revenue come from modems, a third from hub equipment and about 20 percent from sales of Pilot and miscellaneous products.
"As far as technology is concerned, we are very focused on LANs," Benhamou said, contrasting his company's traditional focus on local area networks (LAN) found in corporate offices.
Of 3Com's $2.3 billion in fiscal 1996 revenues, 40 percent came from network adapter cards and 60 percent from sales of hubs, switches and routers systems, largely to corporations.
"We only have about one to two percent overlap in terms of product revenues," Benhamou said of the two companies.

New York State utility regulators are set to approve the Bell Atlantic Corp/NYNEX Corp merger, subject to several conditions, to be set forth prior to a final vote set for Thursday.
Regulators will consider demanding the combined company permanently locate its headquarters in New York, reduce rates, issue $300 million in rebates and improve customer service.
These conditions were among those considered at a hearing Wednesday of the N.Y. Public Service Commission in Albany, the state capitol, which will be taken up at tommorrow's meeting.
The merger would create the nation's largest local phone operator and still faces hurdles in Washington, as well as New York, the only state now withholding its approval.
In Washington, the combination reportedly has met with increased scrutiny in recent weeks from anti-trust officials at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. Federal officials have issued new subpeonas requesting details on rivals' plans to offer local phone service in New York.
The deal still faces an ongoing anti-trust review by New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco, who argues the merger strengthens NYNEX's existing monopoly and represents a bad deal for N.Y. residential and small business customers.
"We are watching closely the review being conducted by the PSC," said Joe Mahoney, a spokeman in the office of the Attorney General, the state's top anti-trust regulator.
Vacco may issue a statement on the subject if the PSC makes its decision Thursday, the spokesman said.
Regulators seek to balance the economic benefits and efficencies created by the merger with any negatives that may arise by strengthening NYNEX's grip on local service and the potential that has to slow the entry of new competitors.
A report by the staff of the N.Y. Public Service Commission discussed at Wednesday's hearing before the three-member panel argued that NYNEX and its merger partner should be required to immediately refund roughly $300 million.
The figure represents one third of the $908 million the report estimated would be the economic benefit of the deal.
The companies dispute this figure, arguing the potential benefit is likely to reach only $600 million by the third year of the deal, according to Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith.
Consumer advocates, who oppose the merger, have countered that the companies should rebate $1.25 billion immediately to consumers, a figure that includes an estimated cost of the loss of competition resulting from the merger. That represents 15 percent of the gains the combined Bell Atlantic could expect to enjoy in the coming five years, they maintain.
However, two of the three commissioners called for any decision about a customer rebate be postponed until a more complete picture of the impact of the deal emerges.
Commission members asked whether the impact should be based on current estimates or whether the determination should wait to see what happens to pricing after the entry of new competitive forces and any savings achieved by the merger.
They also called for other tangible economic benefits to the state, such as strong assurances that the company's primary headquarters will be located in New York.
Commissioner Thomas Duleavy called for the New York corporate headquarters of the company "not to be one of form, but one of substance."
Commissioners also said they want to see more tangible benefits for wholesale and retail NYNEX customers.
They also may decide to increase an existing plan designed to spur NYNEX to improve its long-criticized customer support operations. One proposal would demand that NYNEX increase hiring of customer support personnel and rapidly bring service quality up to the standards of Bell Atlantic.
Also Thursday, the commission approved a two-zone pricing plan that would allow NYNEX competitors to selectively choose which services they purchase from the local phone company as they offer local phone services of their own.
A press advisory issued after Wednesday's meeting said the NYPSC had "reserved a final decision on the NYNEX - Bell Atlantic merger until a special Commission session scheduled for Thursday."
The meeting is set to for 1000 EST/1500 GMT in Albany.
Bell Atlantic closed Wednesday down 1-7/8 to 63-3/8. NYNEX fell 1-3/4 at 47-3/8. The declines reflected a broad decline among Baby Bell stocks and the stock market in general.

Cisco Systems Inc. is set to announce the acquisition of Telesend Inc., a developer of low-cost, high-speed Internet access technology, sources familiar with the deal said Tuesday.
Cisco agreed to acquire Telesend, a privately-held Cupertino, Calif.-based firm, in exchange for an unspecified amount of stock in Cisco, the sources said.
Additional financial terms were not available.
Telesend is the developer of a new telecommunications technology known as ISDN DSL, or IDSL for short. The full name is Integrated Services Digital Network Digital Subscriber Line.
A Cisco spokesman had no comment on the acquisition other than to say, "Most of our acquisitions are of small, privately-held firms."
The spokesman, Adam Stein, said Cisco has made 14 mainly technology-oriented acquisitions in the last three-and-a-half years.
Officials of Telesend were not available to comment, but an automated voicemail system answering calls at Telesend's offices in Cupertino transferred callers directly to a Cisco switchboard operator. Cisco is headquartered in nearby San Jose.
Telesend's IDSL is a local-loop modem technology that allows phone companies to offer Internet access connections from central office switches to local customers at speeds of up to 128,000 bits per second, or about four times the speed of standard phone lines.
Kieran Taylor, an analyst at market research firm TeleChoice Inc., said buying Telesend is a strategic move by Cisco to counter IDSL products announced a month and a half ago by rival equipment maker Ascend Communications Inc.

Shares in Pearson Plc gained on Wednesday as new chief executive Marjorie Scardino officially took the reins at the diversified British media and leisure company.
Scardino, who becomes the first woman to head one of Britain's leading companies, has already said that Pearson's profit performance has been inadequate and disposals are expected as she aims for greater focus on core businesses.
Pearson shares added 8.5 pence to 738.5 pence, reflecting hopes that she will shake up what critics regard as a slumbering giant.
Scardino, a 49-year-old Texan, had been chief executive of The Economist Group, a magazine company half owned by Pearson. A Pearson spokeswoman said Scardino spent her first day "meeting the troops" at the company's central London headquarters.
She has already met her fellow executives and share analysts are hoping for some swift action to focus a company which is accused by critics of underexploiting a stellar group of assets.
Its businesses range from the Financial Times newspaper to Penguin books and a television production arm which makes low-budget programmes such as Australian soap "Neighbours".
Analysts identify Pearson's investment banking interests, its theme park businesses and loss-making U.S. software publishing company Mindscape as the obvious candidates for sale.
Pearson's Tussauds Group unit includes London's landmark Madame Tussaud's waxwork exhibition and theme parks such as Alton Towers in England and Spain's Port Aventura.
It also has a 50 percent stake in London investment bank Lazard Brothers and smaller holdings in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York.
Pearson effectively has a new management team following changes to the board last year.
The process will be complete when Dennis Stevenson replaces Michael Blakenham as chairman in May. Stevenson is currently deputy chairman.

Pearson Plc chief executive Marjorie Scardino began to reshape the British media and leisure company on Friday as she sold its 10 percent stake in Hong Kong broadcaster TVB for 111.1 million pounds ($180.1 million).
The stake in TVB, Hong Kong's leading television broadcaster, has been bought by Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Ltd and associates.
The disposal is the first major strategic move by Texan Scardino since she took over at Pearson last month.
"Our commitment to the growth of our businesses in Asia/Pacific is as strong as ever, but we have decided that this investment is no longer effective in developing either our television business or our other interests in the region," Scardino said.
Pearson acquired the stake in TVB two years ago for 106.2 million pounds and has received dividends of 3.5 million pounds on it.
Share analysts were pleased that Scardino had made an early move in her attempts to improve the focus of the business and said that Pearson had done well to recover its investment.
"It's obviously a blow to Greg Dyke," said one, referring to the head of Pearson's television arm, adding that Scardino appeared to have reversed part of his strategy.
There has been speculation that Dyke, a well-known figure in the British media world, may shortly part company with Pearson.
Dyke said that the investment had given Pearson great insight into the television business in Asia.
"However since we made the minority investment Pearson Television's strategy has evolved to concentrate on programme making and larger broadcast roles," he added.
Pearson shares stood unchanged at 764.5p after the announcement.
Debt rating agency Moody's said on Friday it was downgrading Pearson. Moody's said that this reflected its view that Pearson's debt protection measurements -- weakened by recent acquisitions -- would not recover to previous levels near term.
Scardino, the first woman to head a leading British company, has promised to improve Pearson's profit performance.
The company has a clutch of big-name assets such as the Financial Times newspaper and Penguin Books but has failed to secure an adequate return on these.
Analysts say that the company lacks focus and have predicted that Pearson may sell its Tussauds leisure unit and its stake in merchant bank Lazards.
The Scardino era got off to a bad start when the company announced last week that improper accounting at Penguin USA would force it to make a charge of up to 100 million pounds against 1996 profits.
Pearson said the problems dated back five years but had come to light only very recently. ($1=.6168 Pound)

Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier Plc reported an 11 percent rise in 1996 profit on Wednesday but warned that currencies could depress this year's earnings.
Reed Elsevier co-chairman Nigel Stapleton told Reuters the strength of sterling would, if maintained, "drag down" headline earnings by five percent this year. Earnings figures for the combined businesses of Reed Elsevier are expressed in sterling.
Pre-tax profits rose to 805 million pounds from 723 million on turnover from continuing operations up to 3.38 billion pounds from 3.21 billion.
Analysts had forecast profits of between 808 and 821 million pounds.
Reed International Plc , the British arm of the business, proposed a two-for-one share split to take effect in May.
London-listed Reed shares were down 23.5 pence to 1,150.5p at 1145 GMT, while Elsevier NV shares in Amsterdam dipped 1.70 guilders to 30.80.
Analysts said the company's performance had fallen slightly short of expectations and that Reed shares had risen more than 10 percent over the last two months on bid speculation.
For shareholders in Reed the full-year dividend was raised by 11 percent to 27.2 pence per share. Elsevier shareholders will receive 0.76 guilders per share, a 29 percent increase.
The company noted that currency conversions meant that Elsevier results and dividends were helped in guilder terms.
"It's good news for Elsevier and bad for Reed," said co-chairman Stapleton.
"(But) the two share prices are linked so much that Elsevier should pull Reed up with it in some respects," he added.
Stapleton said the 1996 figures reflected a "solid performance" right across the group. They followed a four percent earnings dilution resulting from the company's 1995 consumer business divestment programme.
Reed Elsevier sold consumer businesses, such as local newspapers, in order to focus on the provision of information in fields like science, business and the legal profession.
Reed Elsevier said it remained committed to an active acquisitions policy.
The company spent over 300 million pounds on some 20 transactions in 1996.
Stapleton said a "big deal" such as Reed's $1.5 billion purchase of U.S. on-line information supplier LEXIS-NEXIS in 1994 would be "nice but not necessary".
Reed said its proposed share split would be put to the vote at its annual general meeting in April, to take effect the following month.
It gave no reason for the split, but companies often opt to split their stock in the belief that the process makes their shares more liquid or tradeable.

The $10.5 billion bid by Hilton Hotels Corp (HHC) for U.S. rival ITT Corp reduces the likelihood of an HHC takeover of British partner Ladbroke Group Plc, share analysts said on Tuesday.
"The Ladbroke share price is off as people had been expecting HHC to take more than a five percent stake in Ladbroke and maybe eventually bid for the company," said one analyst.
"It looks as if they now have other fish to fry," he added.
Ladbroke shares were 1.5p lower at 227p in heavy trading at 1220 GMT on Tuesday, having earlier dipped below 223p.
HHC, America's largest hotel and gaming company, announced in the U.S. on Monday that it was bidding for ITT, owner of the Sheraton hotel chain and Caesars World Casinos.
A Ladbroke spokesman said on Tuesday that the move should have no immediate effect on a worldwide alliance it signed with HHC earlier this month.
The deal reunited the Hilton hotel brand worldwide for the first time since 1964. HHC owns the rights to the name in the U.S. while hotel and betting group Ladbroke held them in the rest of the world.
The two companies can take a share of up to 20 percent in each other under the deal and HHC has said it intends to take a five percent stake in Ladbroke "in due course".
Leisure industry analyst Fraser Ramzan of Lehman Brothers said that a HHC/ITT merger would prove a mixed blessing for investors in Ladbroke.
"A bid from HHC could seem less likely," he said, noting that bid speculation had been supporting Ladbroke's share price.
"On the positive side, if HHC succeed then there is a much larger park of hotel properties which could be brought under one reservation system," he said. ITT's operations include 415 hotels and 130,000 rooms worldwide.
Greg Feehely of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson said that he expected HHC to take a five percent stake in Ladbroke after the British company released its results in March.
He said that it may now take longer for HHC to raise its stake in Ladbroke to 20 percent. However, he said that Ladbroke shares should remain around current levels.
"We are not going to see the stock coming off much. It is still solidly underpinned and there may be potential for Ladbroke to invest in ITT's non-U.S. assets," he said.
Feehely said that a merger between HHC/ITT and Ladbroke remained a medium-term possibility.
"At the turn of the decade all this might just be one company," he said.

British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc posted a small profit increase on Wednesday in the face of a large jump in newsprint costs.
Pre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39.0 million pounds ($60.59 million).
Interim dividend was increased to 1.35p from 1.2p.
Initial market reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding seven to 208.5p by 0845 GMT.
"Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits," chief executive David Montgomery said in a statement.
"The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills," Montgomery added.
Mirror Group's flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain's second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.
The costs of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed -- rose by 18 million pounds year-on-year but Mirror said it had largely managed to off-set this through higher advertising and circulation revenues.
Finance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million.
With newsprint price now levelling off, Allwood said that the company would now seek to win new readers with special supplements to its core titles.
The Mirror's Television arm had losses of 4.2 million pounds, stemming from start-up costs at its Live TV local cable service.
Live TV's offbeat style, including programmes such as topless darts, has earned it hefty criticism but Allwood said this was undeserved.
"It is now receivable in 1.45 million homes and I think people should stop knocking us and give us a bit more credit," he said, adding 60-70 main brand companies advertised on Live.
The channel is currently available in central London and Birmingham but launches are planned in the cities of Liverpool and Edinburgh by the end of the year.

Newcastle United season ticket holders were rewarded for their loyalty on Monday when the English premier league club said only those regular fans would be able to buy shares in a flotation.
Initial interest in the listing appeared to confound the sceptics who suggested that the London stock market's enthusiasm for soccer stocks was waning.
The prices of listed clubs have fallen heavily in recent weeks. First division Charlton Athletic is trading at a heavy discount to its offer price after joining the junior Alternative Investment Market on Friday.
Share analysts said that Newcastle's status as one of the elite of English soccer and a squad boasting talent such as England captain Alan Shearer was bound to tempt investors.
Each Newcastle season ticket holder who has applied for stock will be allocated 370 shares, an investment of 500 pounds ($805), when the club joins the stock market next week.
Newcastle made 15 percent of the placing available to individuals, the remainder going to large institutions. The level of demand meant that ordinary members of the public who are not season ticket holders missed out completely.
The offer price has been set at 135p, capitalising Newcastle at 193 million pounds and making it the third largest English soccer stock after Manchester United and Chelsea.
Former European champions Aston Villa, one place below Newcastle at fifth in the premier league, moved a step closer to the market on Monday when shareholders approved flotation plans.
The Birmingham-based club is aiming to raise 15-20 million pounds in a flotation valuing at in excess of 120 million. The flotation is expected before the soccer season ends in May.
Leicester City, a newly promoted premier league team who have reached this year's League Cup final, are also reported to be considering a flotation.
Soccer club owners have recently cashed in on the game's popularity by joining the stock market. The move allows clubs to raise finance to fund stadium redevelopment and enables directors to spread ownership more widely and see a return on their own investment. ($1=.6215 Pound)

Analyst Jason Crisp of SocGen said he thought that Scardino would make quite rapid decisions on which businesses to keep and which to sell. But he added that any disposals would necessarily take time to complete.
Crisp said that SocGen remained positive about Pearson.
"It's not a storming buy but with a good team in place, I think the share price will tend to improve," he said.
Pearson effectively has a new management team following changes to the board last year.
The process will be complete when Dennis Stevenson replaces Michael Blakenham as chairman in May. Stevenson is currently deputy chairman.
Analyst Colin Tennant of UBS shared the view that investment banking, theme parks and Mindscape could be jettisoned.
But he said that the new management might find it difficult to drive the share price forward while selling off businesses.
"They have stressed they want focus but the problem is there is the possibility of earnings dilution on disposals," he said.
Tennant added that he thought Pearson shares "pretty fully-valued" at current levels.

Shares in British publisher Dorling Kindersley Holdings Plc lost almost 20 percent of their value on Tuesday after the company warned that profits would fall short of last year's level.
Traders wiped over 40 million pounds ($64 million) off Dorling's value as the company warned tough conditions in the U.S. retail book market, currency movements and increased investment in its direct selling business would hit profits.
It restated its profits for the year to end-June 1996 to 12.9 million pounds ($20.5 million) from 17.4 million pounds to reflect a change in the way it accounts for multimedia development costs.
Managing director Rod Hare said profits would fall "somewhat short" of 12.9 million pounds but would not specify how much.
The warning, the second in little more than three months, sent Dorling shares spiralling 60p lower to 261p by 1025 GMT.
The value of the company has halved to around 180 million pounds since the company warned of the likely impact of sterling strength in early December.
Dorling reported a nine percent rise in pre-tax profit to 6.8 million pounds in the six months to December 31. Interim dividend was left unchanged at 1.5 pence per share.
"The primary factor for the downgrade in the profit forecast is...the U.S. book market has not performed as expected," managing director Hare told Reuters.
Hare said that Dorling had suffered from a change in policy at leading U.S. book retail chains Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble, which had cleared out their stock and cut new orders after their store expansion programmes slowed.
Hare said that Dorling believed that a more normal re-order pattern would be restored later this year for back order books, However, he expects the U.S. chains to continue to order less initial stock of new titles.
Dorling earns more than 40 percent of revenue in dollars and Hare said that the strength of the pound would result in "well over a million pounds of lost profit" this year. ($1=.6281 Pound)

British pay television giant BSkyB Plc, a key part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp international media empire, on Thursday staked its claim to a lead role in the development of digital television in the UK.
"Our clear and unambiguous aim is to be in the vanguard of the digital era," BSkyB deputy managing director David Chance told a Financial Times conference on New Media and Broadcasting.
BSkyB, the leading force in British pay television with some 5.5 million subscribers, plans to launch 200-channel digital satellite services into the UK later this year.
BSkyB, one of the corporate success stories of the 1990s in Britain, is 40 percent owned by Murdoch's News Corp.
Murdoch this week threw down the gauntlet to U.S. cable companies when News Corp sealed an alliance with EchoStar Communications Corp to offer satellite services to compete with the cable providers.
The venture, expected to operate under the American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB) name, will offer as many as 500 channels of digital TV, Internet services and local broadcast TV signals to markets across the United States.
News Corp also has important satellite television operations in Asia, such as Star TV and JSkyB, a joint venture in Japan which is expected to begin full service next year.
Back in Britain, BSkyB is also seeking to expand into digital terrestrial television (DTT).
It has joined forces with UK commercial television giants Carlton Communications Plc and Granada Group Plc to apply for licences to run DTT services.
Their British Digital Broadcasting consortium faces competition from DTN, owned by Nasdaq-listed cable company International CableTel, for three key DTT licences.
Britain's Independent Television Commission (ITC) is expected to announce a decision on the licences around May.
DTT, broadcast from land-based transmitters to standard television aerials, is expected to begin in mid-1998 and offer a total of around 30 channels.
Chance said that he hoped that neither UK nor European regulators would oppose British Digital Broadcasting if it were awarded the DTT licences.
"Eight years ago we led Europe in multi-channel TV," Chance said. "We are probably the last in Europe to launch a digital platform...It isn't the time for a handbrake to be applied."
"We are behind and we need to get on with it."
Digital television offers extra channels, improved sound and picture quality and the potential to access interactive services such as home shopping and home banking.
A digital set-top box or decoder is required to view digital channels and a rooftop dish is required to pick up the satellite version. Cable companies are also planning a move to digital.
Digital take-up has been slow in a number of countries, notably in Germany, Europe's largest television market.
Chance said that for digital to succeed it must offer attractive programming at affordable prices and be simple for viewers to understand and use. ($1=.6146 Pound)

Michael Grade, who shocked the British media world this week when he announced he was quitting Channel 4 television, said on Wednesday he was to head First Leisure Plc.
Grade is to become executive chairman of the company by July 31. Current chief executive John Conlan plans to leave the business by the end of the year.
Founded in 1982 by Grade's uncle, Lord Delfont, First Leisure operates a range of leisure business from bowling alleys and bars to the Blackpool Tower tourist site.
"I think I have a feel for what entertains the British public," said Grade when asked about his new role at a company where he is already non-executive chairman.
Grade, 53, announced on Monday that he was quitting as chief executive of the Channel 4 commercial televison network after almost a decade in the job.
Grade, who comes from a leading British showbusiness family, won plaudits at Channel 4 for building the station's audience share to more than 10 percent while maintaining its reputation for distinctive programming.
"The fear I had was that I would get stale," said Grade, commenting on his decision to leave the world of television.
Grade said he wanted to "quit while he was ahead" at Channel 4, having apparently seen off attempts to privatise the station and won the battle to end a system of payments to the ITV commercial television companies.
His move is certain to ensure a higher profile for First Leisure, a company with a market capitalisation of only around 600 million pounds.
The company had pre-tax profit of 43.7 million pounds ($71 million) in the year to end-October on turnover of 183 million.
First Leisure shares added 18.5p to 359.5p on Wednesday as the market welcomed news of Grade's appointment.
But Grade said "continuity not change" would be his motto.
"Anyone who is expecting radical change will be disappointed," he said. "We have a major development programme ongoing. That is where the growth of the company is coming from. That is the strategy."
First Leisure is spending 55 million pounds this year alone on new bars, nightclubs and fitness centres, part of an investment programme worth a total of 100 million pounds.
Channel Four has helped to produce hit British movies such as Four Weddings And A Funeral and Trainspotting in recent years and there had been speculation that Grade might seek to take First Leisure into the movie business.
However, Grade denied press speculation that the company planned to bid for Britain's Rank Film Distributors.
Grade, who was on an annual salary of around 450,000 pounds at Channel Four, would not be drawn on how much he would earn at First Leisure.
Conlan, who denied he had been forced out of the company, was paid some 400,000 pounds in 1995. ($1=.6175 Pound)

Apple Computer Inc will announce as early as Monday a new round of massive job cuts and a plan to reduce the company's operations to three groups, a person close to the company said on Sunday.
The second restructuring in the 12 months since new Chief Executive Gilbert Amelio took control of the struggling company may include job cuts of up to a quarter of Apple's 13,000 workforce, the Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday.
The restructuring also may include moves to focus Apple's half-a-dozen business units even more on selling computers to the publishing industry and schools, the segments where Apple still holds a market-share lead over competitors, the person close to Apple said.
The fourth-biggest U.S. maker of personal computers has been taking a closer look at unprofitable product lines, such as the Newton handheld computer, with an eye toward discontinuing them.
The latest restructuring would come less than a month after Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported an unexpected fiscal first-quarter loss of $120 million. The loss was a setback to Amelio's three-year plan to staunch Apple's losses by 1996, introduce new products by 1997 and to get the company growing again by 1998.
To meet its goal, Apple has to cut another $400 million in costs this year to break even, Apple executives have said. Last year, Apple laid off 1,500 employees. But as customers avoid buying computers from the troubled company, revenue has declined faster than Apple executives expected.
According to a report released last week by market researcher Dataquest, Apple's U.S. shipments dropped 30 pecent in 1996 while the rest of the industry grew 17.8 percent.
Apple now expects revenue for the current fiscal year, which will end September, to decline by about 20 percent to $8 billion.
Apple is still working on the details of the restructuring plan, Apple sources said. An announcement on Monday would come two days before Apple's annual shareholder meeting at its headquarters.

3Com Corp. stock lost more than a quarter of its value Monday after the computer networking equipment maker said its fiscal third-quarter earnings will be less than Wall Street had expected.
3Com, the nation's second largest networking vendor, also had to respond to rising competition from PC component powerhouse Intel Corp. by sharply cutting prices of its so-called ethernet network products, from which it derives 43 percent of its revenue.
The move fuelled even more concern among investors about 3Com's earnings outlook in coming quarters.
Stock in 3Com, based in Santa Clara, Calif., fell $13.50 to $37.25 in Nasdaq trading of more than 36 million shares, making the stock the most active in U.S. markets.
"This goes beyond just the third quarter for 3Com," said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at brokerage Furman Selz.
3Com said for the quarter ending Feb. 28 it will report earnings per share in a range from the mid-40s to low 50 cents a share. Wall Street expected 3Com to earn 60 cents per share, according to a recent survey by First Call, which tracks analyst estimates. A year earlier, 3Com earned 42 cents a share, or $74.6 million.
3Com said third-quarter revenues will reach $770 million to $810 million, missing analyst forecasts by at least $20 million.
3Com makes electronic devices that shuffle information between PCs operating in a network. The company gets about 43 percent of its revenue from ethernet adapter cards: graham cracker-sized devices that plug into PCs to link them with networks.
Last week, Intel, the world's biggest maker of PC components, cut prices of its line of fast ethernet cards sharply. The reduction forced 3Com to announce its own sharp price cuts Monday, fuelling concern about the company's revenue in coming quarters.
"Intel rocked 3Com off its solid foundation," said Carl Howe, senior analyst at market researcher Forrester Research Inc. "They hit 3Com's cash cow."
In the next few years, Intel potentially could incorporate networking functions into its computer chips, eliminating the need for seperate networking products, analysts said. Meanwhile, Intel will use its huge manufacturing facilities and its cost benefit to undercut 3Com in ethernet prices, analysts said.
Pyykkonen said Intel could elbow aside networking suppliers, just as it knocked down suppliers of sound and video components by making multimedia functions a built-in feature of its microprocessors.
"There's no reason why networking can't go the way of PCs," Pyykkonen said.
3Com's shortfall projection prompted several Wall Street analysts to slash their ratings on 3Com stock to hold or neutral.
"The tone of 3Com's business remains weak," said William Rabin, analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., who cut 3Com to "market performer" from "buy."
3Com's earnings forecast also raised concerns about the entire networking industry, whose revenue has been growing about 35 percent annually. 3Com's woes are a sign that industry growth is finally slowing.
"Everyone is not only more on edge about 3Com's numbers but also whether they need to change the revenue picture in the longer term."
Stock in another major network equipment company, Cisco Systems Inc. also fell, dropping $5.125 to $58 on Nasdaq. Ascend Communications Inc., another closely watched networking stock, fell $4.625 to $62.625, also on Nasdaq. Bay Networks Inc. fell 87.5 cents to $18.625, and Cabletron Systems Inc. fell $1.875 to $29, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
Intel also dropped, losing $4.75 to $151.625 on Nasdaq.

Apple Computer Inc., beleaguered by rivals offering cheap and easy-to-use personal computers, will unveil an aggressive advertising campaign attacking the PCs' shortcomings.
Distracted by massive financial losses and two restructurings in one year, Apple has been on a year-long hiatus from ads that poke fun at the intricacies of rivals' computers.
"Our advertising is fluff, soft and not very visible," Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio told investors Wednesday at the company's annual shareholder meeting. "We lost our edge in advertising. And that's unacceptable. I told our advertising people that their job is to get the edge back."
So Amelio charged his advertising people -- the BBDO Worldwide unit of New York-based Omnicon Group Inc. -- to come up with a series that touts the Macintosh's famed ease-of-use and multimedia capabilities.
"Warning. Don't try any of these things on a Windows PC," is the headline of one ad to appear soon in newspapers highlighting the Mac's sound and video features.
The ad may placate Macintosh fans and Apple investors, who have been lamenting the company's marketing silence.
Millions of computer users swear the Macintosh is still easier to use than PCs running software based on Windows 95. But their word-of-mouth has been drowned out by the combined marketing juggernaut of computer powerhouses Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp.
At Wednesday's shareholder meeting, the most vocal criticism against Amelio came not from angry investors holding stock trading near an all-time low, but from Mac fans who want more advertising to spread the Macintosh name.
Apple has not done nearly enough to bolster its image during its restructuring in the past year, said John Lister, principal of brand identity consulting firm Lister Butler Inc. in New York.
"The perception of an organisation is almost as important as the product," Lister said. "The perception about Apple is that they have lost energy and are slipping behind, whereas Microsoft and the rest of the industry is gaining energy."
Lister said although employees of his firm mostly use Macintoshs, none of them could recall recent advertisements.
For the past year, Apple has had far bigger problems to contend with than advertising. The company reported losses totalling more than $800 million in 1996, and saw 1,300 of its employees leave through lay offs or resignations.
The perception that Apple may not survive kept customers away from the Mac aisle at computer stores this Christmas, as well. Apple reported a stunning $120 million loss for the quarter ended in December as sales plunged 32 percent to $2.13 billion.
Amelio said part of his latest restructuring plan is for his marketing department to "go on the attack."
"We've been frustrated with the direction we've gotten from Apple's marketing" while the company went through its turmoil, said David Lubars, chief executive of BBDO West and the chief creative officer behind Apple's ads. "We're now ready to put the edge back in."
Apple will return to its in-your-face style of advertising where it pokes fun at all the intricacies of operating a Microsoft-based PC, Lubars said.
He said Amelio recognised that the blame for weak advertising fell on Apple's own marketing organisation, now BBDO. The agency gets an estimated $100 million from Apple each year. The account, Lubars said, was not in jeapordy.
"Actions speak louder than words, we're still here," he said.

Apple Computer Chairman Gilbert Amelio told the annual shareholders' meeting Wednesday that he was suspending Apple's executive cash bonus plan until the struggling computer maker returned to profitability.
"Let me assure you that my highest priority is to get this company in the black as early as possible," Amelio told Apple shareholders.
Amelio said that when he took the helm of Apple Computer Inc. one year ago, it faced five crises, which he has sought to address.
"We were broke," he said, adding that financial liquidity was so tight the company barely had enough reserves to manage its daily business.
Amelio's comments came a day after the company announced another restructuring and less than a month after Apple stunned Wall Street with a $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997.
Amelio did not provide specifics about the restructuring or how many jobs might be cut as Apple seeks to cut costs.
But he said the company planned to suspend the executive bonus plan until Apple returned to profitability. Recently, Apple officials said they expect to begin making profits again by the end of the 1997 fiscal year in September.
The decision to suspend the cash payouts came after Apple revealed some executives received substantial bonuses last year when Apple reported an unexpected fourth-quarter profit.
The payout was the result of a change in the compensation plan which allowed the executives to receive bonuses based on the company's fourth-quarter rather than full-year results.
For the fourth quarter, which ended in September, Apple reported a profit of $25 million, surprising Wall Street, which had been expecting the company to report a modest loss.
Much of that profit, however, came from a one-time gain Apple recognised for an inventory adjustment. Without that, Apple would have reported a modest loss or broken even, one analyst estimated.
Based on that one profitable quarter, Apple's senior executives received "175 percent of their special bonus target," according to Apple's proxy statement. Amelio, who had a separate compensation agreement with the company, received a $648,000 bonus on top of his $990,000 base salary. Apple did not disclose the bonuses of the other executives.
Apple officials said the special bonus plan was meant to encourage executives to meet their turnaround goals.
"It was basically to motivate them to achieve profitability," Apple spokeswoman Nancy Paxton said on Tuesday. She said the executives had expected financial performance to improve after the fourth quarter.
Apple stock fell 12.5 cents to $15.25 on Nasdaq.

Intel Corp. said Friday its Pentium Pro and new Pentium II chips have a flaw that can cause computers to sometimes make mistakes but said the problems could be fixed easily with rewritten software.
The company will not need to recall the chips, Intel officials said. The flaw was officially dubbed the "Flag Erratum" by Intel, the world's biggest chip maker.
"Basically, an erratum is a design defect that may cause the product to deviate from published specifications," Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop said. "All microprocessors have flaws in them."
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has been investigating the flaw since it was uncovered by an independent analyst last week.
The discovery caused concern among investors and customers because it came just four days before Intel launched the Pentium II, its biggest new product in years.
Some investors feared the flaw could force Intel to replace tens of thousands of chips, as it did in 1994 due to a defect in the original Pentium chip.
International Business Machines Corp. said the flaw should not have any major impact on its PC customers.
"We currently have no information to believe that this reported anomaly will have a major impact on our customers," said a spokesman for the IBM PC Co.
"We are continuing to ship product," a spokesman for Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. said. "Every processor has some kind of errata. This is obviously one that Intel is working on. It's not a show stopper."
The Flag Erratum occurs when some programs try to convert so-called floating point numbers, or decimal numbers, into integers. In some cases, the chip makes rounding errors, and it does not raise a warning flag that it made the error.
Waldrop said Intel would not judge how serious the flaw was, leaving that to computer makers and software developers. But Intel will help developers rewrite programs to compensate for the error when it does come up.
The Pentium Pro, a chip Intel began selling in November 1995, also has the defect.
At first glance, the flaw does not appear to be too serious because it had gone undetected in the Pentium Pro for 18 months, said Rick Doherty, a director at Envisioneering Group Inc., a market researcher company.
"We've got a year-and-half of work on this puppy and no one has reported a single problem with their applications yet," Doherty said.
"But it's not over yet," he said. "This means that an IBM and a Microsoft will have to go through their software packages to see if things are affected by it."
Waldrop said Intel will fix the defect in the new chips it makes. Investors apparently were not concerned about the flaw, as Intel rose 75 cents to $159.50 on Nasdaq.

Apple Computer Inc. Chairman Gilbert Amelio said Wednesday he was suspending the merit bonuses of executives, including himself, until the struggling computer maker reported consistent profits.
Facing a crowd of grumbling shareholders at Apple's annual shareholder meeting, Amelio said he was as disappointed as the shareholders about Apple's $120 million loss in the latest quarter, declining revenue and a stock price near an all-time low.
"Let me assure you that my highest priority is to get this company in the black as early as possible," Amelio told shareholders near the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.
The freeze is on the portion of the bonus that top executives would receive for meeting performance goals. Amelio said the freeze would be in effect until the board rescinded it.
The suspension came a day after the company announced its second restructuring in two years. It also came a month after Apple, the fourth-biggest personal company, reported the stunning $120 million loss.
To get the company back to profits, Apple plans to cut costs by $400 million by the end of its fiscal year in September. Amelio said cost reductions would involve job cuts and possible sale or discontinuation of product lines.
"It's time for Apple to face the fact that we cannot do everything," Amelio said. "We can't be in every market. We can't support every technology."
Amelio would not specify the number of jobs Apple was considering cutting nor whether the company would discontinue the Newton handheld computer, as has been reported.
Industry analysts have said they expect Apple to cut between 2,000 and 3,000 jobs from its work force of 13,000.
Amelio said when he took the helm of Apple one year ago, "we were broke." He added that financial liquidity was so tight the company barely had enough reserves to manage its daily business.
"The company was simply doing too much, moving in too many directions, and not enough of it was profitable," Amelio said. "I sometimes think that, when it comes  to cool new projects, Apple's eyes were bigger than its stomach."
Businesses were so fragmented, he said, the company was using no fewer than seven different financial systems and its forecasting system was "completely inadequate".
Amelio outlined actions he has taken to address these crises, including the company's decision in December to acquire Next Software Inc. for $400 million to help Apple develop a new stable, high-operating operating system.
The decision to suspend the executive bonus programme comes after the company revealed some executives received substantial bonuses last year when Apple reported an unexpected fourth-quarter profit.
Apple's compensation board approved a special bonus plan in July 1996 based on whether the company would report a profit in the fiscal fourth quarter, ended September 1996.
For the fourth quarter, Apple reported net income of $25 million. Much of that net income, however, came from a one-time gain Apple recognised for an inventory adjustment. Without that gain, Apple would have reported a modest loss or would have simply broken even, one Wall Street analyst estimated.
Based on that one profitable quarter, Apple's senior executives received "175 percent of their special bonus target," according to Apple's proxy statement. Apple did not disclose the target levels nor the amount of the bonuses.
Amelio, who had a seperate compensation agreement with the company, received a $648,000 bonus on top of his $990,000 salary. Apple officials said the bonus plan was meant to encourage executives to meet their turnaround goals.
Apple stock dipped 12.5 cents to $15.25 on Nasdaq.

Apple Computer Inc. reported a $708 million second-quarter loss Wednesday, reflecting a charge for the layoff of a third of its employees and weaker sales of its personal computers,
Apple said, however, that strong sales of new, speedy PCs and laptops and lower expenses would help the company meet its goal of reporting a profit by its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in September.
The Cupertino, Calif.-based computer company's net loss, equivalent to $5.64 a share, for the fiscal quarter ended March 28 compared with a net loss of $740 million, or $5.99 a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Apple's loss from operations of $186 million, or $1.48 a share, was worse than the consensus industry analyst forecast of $1.22 a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst forecasts.
The $708 million net loss included a $155 million charge to cover the cost of layoffs and a $375 million charge for the acquisition of software developer Next Software Inc.
Apple said, however, that it expects to see higher revenue and a reduced operating loss in the third quarter as its restructuring program takes hold. In March, the company said it would lay off 4,100 employees and reorganize operations to cut costs.
"Don't open champagne bottles yet, but the process seems to be working," said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.
During the quarter, Apple introduced a jazzy laptop and a speedy desktop machine for small businesses, schools and homes. Sales of the new machines have been strong, the company said.
"We feel the worst is behind us and our strategy is on track," Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio said in a telephone conference call with analysts. He said sales will probably increase in the third quarter over the second and that the company probably will meet its goal of being profitable again by the fourth quarter.
Still, even with better financial health, Apple faces serious problems, analysts said.
The number of Apple computers shipped worldwide in the second quarter plunged 33 percent to 602,000 units, compared with 892,000 units in the same quarter a year ago. The drop was bigger than most analysts expected.
Sales in Japan and Europe also were weak, Apple executives said in the conference call.
"I want to see a couple of positive quarters before I say they're beginning to turn the corner," said Michael Kwatinetz, analyst at the DMG Technology Group investment bank in New York.
To keep costs in line with declining sales, Apple in the past year has laid off more than 5,000 employees. The company also has seen its entire management suite change in 15 months.
The uncertainty about the company's future still is keeping customers away from the Mac aisle at stores, analysts said.
Dataquest, which tracks PC sales worldwide, says Apple's share of the worldwide market fell to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent. The slide left Apple's market share at the lowest point in three years.

Apple Computer Inc. said Tuesday it will consolidate its independent marketing and development units into fewer groups to cut costs and to concentrate on selling computers in key markets.
Apple also said Steve Wozniak, the electronics whiz who invented the company's first computer 20 years ago, will rejoin with Steven Jobs, the other Apple co-founder, as a part-time advisor to Chairman Gilbert Amelio.
Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said it is still examining all aspects of its business and will determine by the end of the month how many jobs it will cut. The company also is considering dropping some product lines -- possibly including the Newton handheld computer, analysts have said -- to reduce its expenses by 20 percent by the end of the year.
"Simplicity is what makes this reorganization appropriate for Apple" compared with other reorganizations in the past, said Guerrino De Luca, the new head of Apple's global marketing efforts.
Analysts had expected Apple to give specific details on Tuesday about job cuts and the financial impact of the move. They will have to wait until the end of the month, Apple executives said, while they analyse the company's situation.
Since Amelio took helm of the company last year, the company has focused on stanching quarterly losses, reducing inventories and increasing cash reserves, said George Scalise, head of Apple's operations.
"This organisation builds on that," Scalise said. "It now allows us to focus on markets, to be focused on the hardware and software and to take advantage of the strengths we've built over the past six to eight months."
With the most recent restructuring, the second in a year, Apple for the first time consolidates all its marketing functions under one manager, De Luca. The company also set up a worldwide sales and support organisation to be led by Marco Landi, currently Apple's chief operating officer.
Wozniak, who co-founded the company with Steve Jobs at the home of Jobs' parents, also will return to the company to advise Amelio on a part-time basis. Jobs rejoined Apple two months ago when Apple bought his software company, Next Software Inc., for $400 million in a move to revamp the Macintosh computer.
Analysts have said Amelio has done a decent job of shaping up the company's balance sheet, but have questioned his strategy of attracting new customers by basing the company's next generation of computers on Next's technology.
"Next is 1989 technology," said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter. Apple will have a hard time convincing outside software companies to develop programmes for the new machines, when they come out late this year, Murphy said.
One of the biggest blows to Apple's strategy came Tuesday when Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., said he was "confused" about Apple's software strategy.
"I am very interested in continuing to work with Apple as we have done through history," Gates said on Tuesday at a new product launch in Germany. "But I am confused by the Apple operating system strategy ... and have decided not to worry about the future."
Microsoft's support for any new Apple product is crucial because corporate customers increasingly are deploying Microsoft's word processors and spreadsheets as their standard.

Sequent Computer Systems Inc expects its revenue to increase at least 30 percent in 1997 on strong sales of its new NUMA-Q computer, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday.
"Our investors ought to be able to expect at least a 30-percent growth," said Casey Powell, Sequent chairman and chief executive.  
Sequent specializes in making computers that pack dozens of inexpensive Intel Corp Pentium microprocessors - the same kind of chips found in personal computers -- into one box. By harnessing the power of a team of Pentiums, a Sequent machine has about the same horsepower as an International Business Machine Corp mainframe computer, the favored data-processing workhorse at big companies.
Using clever software tricks and faster microprocessors, Sequent's new NUMA-Q line packs even more power in one box at a fraction of the cost of operating a mainframe, Powell said.  
"If what Sequent is saying is true, they are going to sell an awful lot of these systems," said Scott Butler, an analyst at Jensen Securities, a Portland, Ore., brokerage.
There is already plenty of attention from customers. Companies such as Boeing Co, Unocal Corp, Ford Motor Co and the National Association of Securities Dealers have bought the machines, Powell said.
A quarter of Sequent's fourth-quarter revenue of $183.2 million came from NUMA-Q sales, according to company. By the end of the year, almost all of Sequent's revenue will come from NUMA-Q sales, Powell said.  
In 1996, Sequent had net income of $7.77 million, or $0.23 a share, on revenue of $595.4 million.
Powell, the 52-year-old co-founder of the company, said he believes the new machines can help Sequent meet the rising demand for alternatives to the mainframe.
"There's an $178-billion base of installed mainframes out there," he said. "About 12 percent of that market says, 'We are actively looking to get off the mainframe.'"
Even a sliver of the business from the mainframe defectors "is a damn nice piece of business for me," Powell said.  
To pursue new business, Sequent increased its sales staff by 50 percent last year -- part of the reason why 1996 net income plunged 78 percent from 1995.
But Sequent is not the only vendor chasing the business. Last week, Sun Microsystems Inc, the $7-billion vendor of high-performance computers, unveiled Starfire, a machine that also uses dozens of microprocessors to rival a mainframe.
Some analysts even said there is no big rush to dump mainframes.  
"This is a brand-new technology," said Jerry Sheridan, an analyst at market researcher Dataquest. To long-time customers of mainframes, "this is going to be a hard sell in the near term."
Still, at least some investors are confident Sequent can lure customers. Sequent's stock has almost doubled in the past 12 months to about 18 on expectations of strong NUMA-Q sales.
With much of the cost of NUMA-Q's development and the investment in an expanded sales force out of the way, net income will "absolutely" increase in 1997, Powell said.  
Butler, who rates Sequent's stock as "outperform," said prospects are good that the shares will keep rising in coming months.

Lam Research Corp., expanding its expertise in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, said Monday it agreed to buy OnTrak Systems Inc. for $225 million in stock.
The acquisition would help Lam enter one of the fastest-growing parts of the semiconductor equipment industry, analysts said.
As part of the agreement, Lam also will get a new chief executive: James Bagley, the current chief executive of OnTrak and an industry veteran who could help Lam manage its growth better, analysts said.
Seperately, Lam said it expected to report a loss of $1.40 a share in the fiscal third quarter because of slower-than-expected sales and write-offs of obsolete parts for older products. Wall Street expected Lam to report a profit of 7 cents for the quarter ending March 31.
In last year's fiscal third quarter, Lam reported a profit of $38.6 million, or $1.37 a share.
Lam Research, a manufacturer of machines used in computer chip factories, will trade 0.83 of its shares for each of OnTrak's shares and options outstanding. Based on Lam's Monday closing stock price of $31.50, Lam would pay about $26.15 for each OnTrak share. OnTrak shares closed at $28.
"The main reason for the acquisition is to fill out our product line," said Roger Emerick, Lam's current chief executive, who will give up that role but retain his position as chairman.
OnTrak's chemical mechanical planarization machines -- devices used to polish semiconductor wafers during the chip manufacturing process -- would help Lam enter an industry segment that is growing 31 percent a year, Emerick said.
More important to Lam is getting Bagley, the executive who helped Applied Materials Inc., the biggest semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, grow from $70 million to $4 billion, said Dan Hutcheson, president of market researcher VLSI Research Inc.
"Lam's weakness has been operations. Operations is Bagley's strength," Hutcheson said.
Lam could use Bagley's help. At the same time Lam announced the acquisition, it told investors that it will report an unexpected loss for the quarter ending in March.
Most of the loss will come from write-offs of obsolete inventory. Part of it will come from slower-than-expected sales as some customers put off major purchases until the fourth quarter, the company said.

French energy group Total SA on Wednesday reported a 50 percent rise in its 1996 net income to 5.6 billion francs ($1 billion), boosted by higher oil prices, a firmer dollar, improved refining margins and productivity gains.
The profit figure, which was in line with financial analysts' expectations, would have shown a 150 percent increase if 1995 special charges of 1.5 billion francs were taken into account.
Operating income rose by 37 percent to 10.2 billion francs on 30 percent higher sales of 176 billion francs.
Total chairman Thierry Desmarest said the profit improvement compared with rises of some 25 percent at U.S. oil majors.
Larger French group Elf in December said its 1996 net income would be between 7.3 and 7.5 billion francs compared with 5.3 billion in 1995, or some 40 percent higher.
Total shares initially rose on the figures but closed down 0.55 percent at 471.50 francs while the CAC-40 blue chip index was down 0.71 percent.
"The market had anticipated the increase in results. The figures were in line with expectations," an analyst said.
Total said that external factors had contributed two billion francs to the rise in operating income.
"A more favourable operating environment in 1996 than 1995 accounts for more than half of (the) 3.3 billion franc increase in operating income," Total said.
The U.S. dollar rose to an average rate of 4.99 francs in 1995 to 5.12 francs in 1996, Brent oil rose to 20.7 per barrel from $17.04 per barrel while the refining margins improved to $13.6 per tonne from $11.4 per tonne.
Productivity gains contributed 500 million francs to the improvement and higher volumes 1.1 billion. An increase in operating expenses trimmed the total gain by 300 million.
Desmarest said he expected the oil price to slip in 1997, due to the return of Iraq to the market and higher production by non OPEC members, but he expected it not to fall as far as the 1994/1995 low of $16.40 a barrel.
"I do not think that we will continue to see the favourable prices from the start of the year," Desmarest said. "But it is very unlikely that it will return to a level of $16.40 per barrel."
Total expects a further increase in profits but Desmarest declined to be drawn into precise forecasts.
"Continuing production growth and ongoing productivity gains projected over the next few years should allow the company to improve profitability relative to the 1996 level of return on equity." Total said.
Desmarest told the news conference that he aimed to get a four billion franc increase in the years up to 1999. "For the next three years, and with unchanged circumstances, we aim to improve the operating results by four billion francs," he said.
Total aims to boost its investments in 1997 to 18 billion francs, from 16 billion in 1995, with the lion's share going to upstream activities -- exploration and production.
Desmarest said that by the year 2000, he expected about half of the company's operating income to come from exploration and production, while both the downstream and chemicals activities would have a slice of 20 to 25 percent.
Total aims to have reserves to allow it to tap into more than one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year 2000 and planned further growth after that.
In downstream, refining and marketing, Total is still faced with a weak European market.
Desmarest said the company was ready to participate in a restructuring of the refining industry but he did not plan to shut Total's refineries. Instead he was willing to offer access to the refineries to other operators in exchange for closures.

Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and French chemical group Rhone-Poulenc SA Thursday announced the merger of their animal health businesses to create a new company that will be the world leader in the sector.
Merial Animal Health, their 50/50 joint venture with estimated 1996 sales of $1.750 billion, will be the market leader in biology products, veterinary drugs and poultry drugs, they said.
Merial will overtake Pfizer-Smithkline Beecham, Bayer and Novartis -- the recent merger between Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG of Switzerland.
Igor Landau, managing director of Rhone-Poulenc, told a news conference in Paris that the merger would cut costs and have an effect on jobs, although it was too early to give details.
"It will not be in France that the impact will be most pronounced," he said, adding that the merger would have a positive effect on Rhone's results.
Merck will make an unspecified payment to Rhone for the 50/50 parity.
"Taking everything into account, the valuation of our business was higher than that of Merck," Landou said.
The joint-venture will merge the animal health activities of Rhone Merieux and Merck AgVet. It will be headed in the first few years by Merck's John Preston, while Rhone's Louis Champel will become chief executive of Merial and will succeed Preston.
Merck was No. 2 in animal health in 1995 but has been overtaken in 1996 by Novartis. Its leading product, Ivermectine, loses some of its patent protection next year but still has about eight years of sales ahead of it. Sales for this product alone in 1996 have been $750 million.
Rhone Merieux's main product is the recently launched Frontline, which has had sales this year of $85 million and are expected to double in 1997.
Merial will benefit from the launch of a number of new Merck products in the coming years while a new jointly developed product will be ready in three years.
"The real creation of added value is in innovation," Landau said, stressing the possible synergies of the joint research and development.
The Merial venture is the latest of a series of big corporate moves in animal health.
In 1994, American Cyanamid was bought by American Home Products Corp. In 1995 Pfizer bought the animal health business of Smithkline Beecham Plc and Rhone Merieux acquired the veterinary business of Sanofi, part of Elf Aquitaine.
In 1996 Belgium's Solvay sold its animal health business to AHP.
Landau said that Mallinckrodt, No. 9 in world animal health, was for sale but that Rhone was not interested.
Asked to comment on rumours of a merger between Rhone's Rhone-Poulenc Rorerand Sanofi, following a statement Thursday by Elf that a merger was desirable for Sanofi, Landau said Rhone was not interested in a pharmaceutical alliance.

France's Rhone-Poulenc SA said on Thursday its 1996 net income grew 28.4 percent to 2.74 billion francs ($494.9 million), but called this an insufficient level.
Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou denied market rumours the company was on the look-out for acquisitions, sought a merger or planned to split its chemicals and pharmaceuticals activities.
He told a news conference the group would focus on internal growth and he maintained his target of an increase in 1997 earnings per share of 20 percent, before exceptionals, from 8.44 francs in 1996.
Fourtou said the group would in 1997 exceed its planned two-year asset sale programme of 10 billion francs, which stood at 6.8 billion at the end of 1996, and would slash debt to below 50 percent of equity, from 61 in 1996 and 72 in 1995.
Sales were three percent higher at 85.82 billion francs and operating income rose 38.5 percent to 6.892 billion. The gross dividend was increased by 16.7 percent to 5.25 francs per share.
The profit figure was in line with analysts' expectations and Rhone-Poulenc shares closed 0.39 percent lower at 179.80 francs while the CAC-40 blue-chip index was up 1.54 percent.
"This is an encouraging figure, but it remains insufficient for a company of our size," Fourtou said about the profit.
He said there were three negative elements in the group's results -- the recall of albumin products at Centeon, a worldwide crisis in polyester which reduced operating income by 700 million francs, and a very low price of titanium oxide which had a 500 million franc negative impact.
Centeon is a 50-50 joint venture between Germany's Hoechst AG and Rhone's 68 percent-owned pharmaceuticals unit Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
Finance director Jean-Pierre Tirouflet said that while the negative effects would persist in the first quarter and perhaps first half of 1997, he saw an improvement in operating results of these activities.
Fourtou said that while improving profitablilty and cutting debt was his main priority, he dismissed rumours of a merger, split-up or capital increase.
"I can confirm we do not plan a major acquisition in 1997. We have never had so many opportunities for internal growth," he said. "I can also confirm that we have no plans for a capital increase, as is being rumored, nor do we envisage a de-merger."
He said later that his company was not interested in buying Elf Aquitaine's health and beauty unit Sanofi nor in linking up with this company.
"Firstly, as far as I understand, Sanofi is not for sale. But Elf has said it is willing to go below 50 percent," he said. "I want to make clear that we are not interested in an acquisition of Sanofi nor in a link-up with this company."
Fourtou added that while Rhone wanted better access to the Japanese and other Far Eastern markets, the company had dropped its previous goal of finding a Japanese takeover candidate and was now focusing on joint ventures.

A French parliamentary commission said on Wednesday that it approved a planned merger between Anglo-French industrial power group GEC Alsthom and state-controlled nuclear engineering group Framatome.
But it attached a number of conditions to its approval that go beyond the terms set by Industry Minister Franck Borotra.
The Socialist members of the commission, however, said they opposed the privatisation of Framatome and they feared four to five thousand of the company's 19,000 jobs could be lost.
GEC Alsthom is a joint venture between France's Alcatel Alsthom and Britain's General Electric Co Plc.
The French government in August gave the go-ahead for a merger study between GEC Alsthom and Framatome, the world's biggest maker of nuclear power stations.
Framatome competes against Swiss-Swedish ABB, Germany's Siemens, Mitsubishi of Japan, and U.S. firms General Electric and Westinghouse.
Alcatel has a 44 percent stake in Framatome, with the rest in the hands of French state groups CEA, EDF and CDR.
The commission said in a statement that after six weeks of study and talks, it had concluded that a merger had undeniable advantages and even found that it would be "suicidal" for Framatome to try and survive the next 10 to 15 years on its own because few nuclear stations are expected to be ordered.
The commission put down nine conditions to the merger.
It said the group had to be French, which means that Framatome has to absorb GEC Alsthom, which is a joint-venture under Dutch law, and not the reverse.
It also wants French shareholders to have control for as long the group is unlisted and a blocking minority when it is listed.
It said the nuclear activities of Framatome had to be put in a special subsidiary of the new group and public authorities should have a right of veto on strategic decisions.
It said the cash reserves of this unit should be at least equal to a provision for nuclear risks, or the cost of decommissioning plants, estimated at 6.5 billion francs ($1.24 billion).
The commission said cooperation with Siemens on the development of a new European nuclear reactor should continue and the parliamentarians suggested a share swap between the nuclear subsidiary and Siemens's KWU unit.
The commission also called for a new cooperation deal between Framatome, CEA and electricity utility EDF as well as for an extension to 2011 of an agreement between Framatome and nuclear material group Cogema on fuel rods.
Finally, the commission said parliament should have control over the nuclear activities.
It said all nine conditions were "non-negotiable".
Borotra's conditions include French identity, the Siemens link, a French majority stake and provisions for nuclear risks.
GEC has let it be known that it wants a stake equal to that of Alcatel in the new group and that it does not want to end up a minority shareholder.
Framatome had net attributable profit of 663 million francs in 1995 on sales of 17.9 billion.
GEC Alsthom had operating income of 2.6 billion francs in 1995 on sales of 29.3 billion francs.

The French government Wednesday called off its controversial sale of state electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe but President Jacques Chirac vowed to complete the privatisation.
The government, which had doggedly defended its choice amid a storm of employee protest and political opposition, suddenly reversed itself after the independent Privatisation Commission challenged the terms of a South Korean firm's involvement in the sale.
"The French defence electronics industry can lay claim to being world class," Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said. "The privatisation of Thomson is key to creating the necessary 'poles of excellence' needed to achieve this ambition.
"The government will carry out (the sale) in accordance with the terms set on Feb. 22," she said, referring to Chirac's televised speech on restructuring the army and defence industry.
Finance Minister Jean Arthuis told reporters the process would be delayed by several weeks, but other politicians said it could be stalled for months.
"Unfortunately, the decision to suspend the privatisation process to which the government has had to resort will delay this process by serveral months, possibly even a year," said, Francois-Michel Gonnot, a parliamentary committee chairman and member of the ruling coalition.
Lagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58 percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its Matra Defence Espace unit and sell Thomson Multimedia, which makes televisions and video recorders, to Daewoo Electronics Co. of South Korea.
The Privatisation Commission, France's highest authority on the sale of state assets, said in a confidential report obtained by Reuters that the Daewoo deal did not fully reflect the value of Thomson's technology in digital decoders and flat screens.
The decision to suspend the sale of money-losing Thomson SA was the government's second embarassing reversal on a privatisation in two weeks. It earlier decided to suspend the sale of state-owned bank CIC following staff protests and political opposition.
Several thousand workers of Thomson Multimedia marched in Paris and other cities Nov. 20 to protest their company's sale to a booming Asian competitor, fearing for their jobs and working conditions.
The government said in mid-October it had picked Lagardere over rival bidder Alcatel Alsthom because it was best for French defence interests and that it would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc (19 cents) after a 10.8 billion franc ($2 billion) state capital injection.
Opposition parties said Wednesday that they hoped the delay would lead to the total scrapping of the sale plan.
"Today is a first success ... but we should not stop there," Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande said.
"We are now calling for the privatisation to be abandoned totally," he said. Communist Party members said they now wanted a national debate on the future of Thomson.

France Telecom has been ordered by France's new telecommunications supervisor to review a proposal for a list of prices it will charge its future competitors for the use of parts of its infrastructure.
"We have had a meeting will all the operators yesterday. We are waiting for a new proposal by France Telecom," Jean-Michel Hubert, president of the new ART regulator, said during the body's first news conference on Thursday.
The catalogue of so-called interconnection charges is going to be a key element both for the economic viability of future entrants into the French market as well as for the value of France Telecom, slated for partial privatisation this spring in the biggest French market float ever.
Hubert said that he hoped to be able to render opinion of the Autorite de Regulation des Telecommunications (ART) on the draft decree on interconnection at the start of February.
Telecommunications Minister Francois Fillon aims to publish the final decree before the end of that month.
As far as the actual price list is concerned he hoped the five-strong body could take a decision "as soon as possible" and added it should be before the partial sale of France Telecom.
He declined to be specific about what kind of changes ART was asking from France Telecom -- the other operators are demanding drastic price cuts from an original proposal -- only saying that he wanted to be "equitable".
Hubert noted that there was "only a small window" between a price structure at which competition was impossible and another at which competition would be "ridiculous".
He added that while ART would take account of international comparisons, because he believed there would be a move to harmonise these costs internationally, he said such a comparison should not be the norm for a decision.
ART started its legal life on January 6, taking over the regulatory and licencing authorities that were previously the prerogative of the Ministry of Telecommunications.
ART is indepedent and will also have to act as an arbitrator in case of disputes between various operators.
Its five members -- appointed by the presidents of the republic, senate and parliament -- cannot be sacked nor can they seek a new term. Apart from Hubert, the members are Dominique Roux, Yvon Le Bars, Roger Chinaud and Bernard Zuber.
Hubert said that a difference with Britain's OFTEL was that ART will take decisions as a college while at OFTEL the director-general has the decision-making power.
Asked whether ART would make life as difficult for France Telecom as OFTEL has made that of British Telecom Plc, Hubert said only that he expected "hard and difficult talks with all operators."
Hubert said he wanted to promote growth of the market, which would boost economic growth and jobs. He said he had the interests of the consumer in mind and noted the existence of ART alone as an unbiased regulator was an incentive to competition.
But he made it clear that ART would also come to the aid of France Telecom, or other French operators, as far as international matters were concerned. ART still needs to appoint a director of international affairs but Hubert said the matter was very important and had to be based on reciprocity -- if French operators find obstacles abroad, ART could be engaged in the negotiations.
Hubert is travelling to London on Monday to meet OFTEL's Don Cruickshank and other international counterparts. He said much of the international negotiations would need to be done on a European level while the EU member states would want to harmonise their regulation in a single telecoms market.
Hubert said that ART was following closely discussions between France Telecom, Generale des Eaux unit SFR and Bougues Telecom about the cost of interconnecting mobile telecommunications but said ART had not been asked to arbitrate in the matter.
"I hope the operators come to an agreement," he said.

French food group Saint Louis on Tuesday tightened its grip on the Spanish sugar sector by acquiring a 15 percent stake in Spain's biggest sugar company and second-largest food group Ebro Agricolas.
Analysts welcomed the move and Saint Louis shares rose two percent to 1,355 francs in an otherwise flat stock market.
"I think they want to have a controlling stake in Spanish sugar-making but I do not believe that the political powers there will allow them to do so quickly. They have to go slow," said a Paris-based food sector analyst.
The company's Generale Sucriere unit bought the 15 percent stake from Banco Santander. Spanish newspapers said the deal was for 17.14 billion pesetas ($129.4 million).
A Saint Louis spokesman declined to comment on the price but said Ebro had a market value of 110 billion pesetas, annual sales of 154 billion pesetas and a market share of 54 percent.
Saint Louis already has a stake of about 21 percent in Sociedad General de Azucarera de Espana (Azucarera), Spain's second-largest sugar group.
The two Spanish groups said in December they were working on a merger which would create the European Union's fifth-largest sugar group. Ebro bought a 21.8 percent stake in Azucarera from bank Banco Central Hispano (BCH) in November.
Saint Louis chairman Daniel Melin has said he wants to have a stake of 20 to 25 percent in the merged group, which would produce 80 percent of Spain's European Union sugar quota.
"We would now have a 17 percent stake in a merged group which is in line with our policy. We do not want to rise above 25 percent because we would have to make a bid for the rest. We want to be a shareholder, not an operator," Saint Louis spokesman Olivier Labesse said.
Spain's Ministry of Agriculture has in the past blocked attempts by the French group to increase its stake in Azucarera as part of a general policy of stopping foreign companies taking control of the Spanish sugar market.
"I believe Saint Louis will try to get a majority and restructure the new company where there is a lot of scope for cost savings. The Spanish ministry may be against it and they can huff and puff but I do not really see how they can block it," a London-based analyst said.
"There will be a lot of political opposition to a majority stake," said Dominique Bastien of brokerage Pinatton Wargny.
BCH has sold another 24 percent in Ebro to a savings bank, Caja de Salamanca. The Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) is Ebro's largest shareholder with a 35 percent stake, while state-owned food group Mercase is expected to increase its 4.7 percent holding by buying BCH's remaining 4.1 percent stake.
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson financial analyst Charles Manso welcomed the Ebro deal and said he was reviewing his Saint Louis recommendation and might raise it from "hold".
"This is the second bit of good news in two days. We have to factor that in. I think today's deal is slightly earnings enhancing," Manso said.
On Monday, Saint Louis said it was closing its sugar plant at Bresles in France as part of a rationalisation of its production structure.
"The new management has been in place for 18 months now and they are doing the right things," Manso said.
In November, it sold its Royal Champignon mushroom unit to Champi-Jandou and it has made provisions for restructuring at its 40 percent-owned paper unit Arjo Wiggins Appleton.
Melin, a former head of construction group Spie Batignolles, was named chairman and chief executive at Saint Louis in May 1995 after Bernard Dumon died in a plane crash in January.
The group is controlled by Bank Worms et Cie, which has a 27.8 percent stake and Italy's IFIL SpA, an Agnelli family finance company, with a 25.9 percent stake.
"I like what they are doing with sugar and with paper, but I do not see what they are going to do to create their so-called third pole," said a Paris analyst.
Saint Louis is the fourth-largest sugar group in Europe behind Germany's Suedzucker, Britain's Tate and Lyle Plc and France's Eridania Beghin-Say.

Within a few years, some two million severely handicapped people in Europe could communicate with each other over the global Internet using a special eye-movement control to run a personal computer.
A small French team of researchers on Thursday showed the latest prototype of an Apple Macintosh computer that reacts to the subtle movements of the eye.
This system, which follows a clinical test with 30 people in France to evaluate a word processor commanded by eye movement, opens the world of multimedia to the handicapped and will allow them to entertain themselves with electronic books, compact discs or computer games.
"Severely handicapped people are mainly young people in the 15 to 31 years category who have had a road accident. They have not always been handicapped, they still have all their intellectual facilities and they have a very long life expectancy," said Bernard de Groc of social researchers Delta 7.
Doctor Philippe Thoumie, who coordinated clinical tests in three hospitals in France this year, said that of the 30 people that had tried to use it, 22 had managed to do so with success.
"The main advantage of this system is that it is not a heavy system that makes a patient feel bad. They do not want to be robocops with special helmets on or with wires all over them," he told a news conference.
The idea of letting the handicapped, especially those that have lost control of their upper body functions and sometimes even their speech faculty, communicate through the use of a computer is not new.
There are systems that let a person "push" buttons on a screen by means of a mounted headset with a laserbeam.
Other systems let the alphabet pass by on a screen and the patient can indicate the right letter. Yet another system puts sensors on the patient's face. There are also mouse-based systems for people who have still some control over their hands.
"The difficult thing was to be able to track eye-movements with a fixed camera in a head which is not being kept still," said Jacques Charnier, a researcher of the INSERM institute in Lille who has been working on the system since 1990.
The Deltavision system they developed allows the handicapped to use ordinary computers and standard software applications.
For that they have to sit in front of a computer screen above which there is a small box. This box contains a small camera in the middle of a field of characters and symbols.
The camera tracks the eye when the handicapped person looks at a character to write a sentence in a word processor programme, or to give commands to execute other programmes.
Charnier said the system could be coupled to infrared sensors that can change the volume of a music system or the temperature in a room. It can be used to play compact discs, make recordings of telephone conversations, browse through an encylopaedia on CD-Rom or surf the Internet.
Delta 7 will test four of the upgraded prototypes in 1997, at a cost of some 150,000 French francs ($28,460) each, and hopes to be able to start commercialising the system in 1998.
Financed by mutual insurance fund Mutuelles de Mans and a French medical charity, Delta 7's Groc is not dreaming of the commercial value of the machine but of new applications.
"What we want to do next is to make a system than can be used by people who have to stay in bed," he said. ($1=5.270 French Franc)

French Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole said on Saturday it would take full control of merchant bank Banque Indosuez from financial holding company Compagnie de Suez on December 23.
The two companies said in a joint statement that the total price would be 11.9 billion francs.
Credit Agricole bought a 51 percent stake in the merchant bank in July for 6.3 billion francs and will on Monday pay the outstanding 5.6 billion francs.
Compagnie de Suez said its 1996 annual result, expected to be published on April 2, would show a 300 million franc capital gain on the transaction.
Under the original sale terms, Credit Agricole would have bought an additional 29 percent in July 1997 and the remaining 20 percent on January 1, 2000.
"It has been a joint decision to speed up the transaction," Compagnie de Suez spokeswoman Michele Meyzie told Reuters.
"Credit Agricole has engaged a restructuring of its activities and this is easier to pursue when it has full control of Indosuez. At the same time, for us it is welcome to have the capital gain and the 5.6 billion francs in cash," she added.
The companies said than an audit ended at June 30 this year showed that the value of Indosuez was 11.790 billion francs to which was added some interest.
In May, when the orginal deal between the two companies was announced, the vale of the bank was put at 11.85 billion francs.
Credit Agricole is setting up an international investment bank under the Banque Indosuez name -- combining French brokers Cheuvreux de Virieu, Dynabourse and Hayaux de Tilly.
In asset management, there is the combination of Indosuez and Segespar which have a combined 650 billion francs under management.
On Friday, Dutch savings bank SNS said it was buying Banque Indosuez Nederland NV.
Gerard Mestrallet, the former head of Societe Generale de Belgique who was appointed chairman of parent Suez in July 1995 after a messy board room battle, is restructuring the holding company which suffers from heavy property losses.
In June, Mestrallet said he expected a return to profit in 1996 after a pre-tax loss of 3.9 billion francs in 1995.
Credit Agricole has a five percent stake in Suez.

America Online Inc. was hit with two more lawsuits Wednesday when two New York law firms said they filed class actions on behalf of their clients and AOL members frustrated with the world's largest online service.
The two lawsuits, both filed in New York state court this week, come on the heels of a class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles on behalf of five subscribers, seeking damages for what they call fraudulent and malicious representation.
In addition, at least two state attorney generals have confirmed they are in discussions with America Online, seeking some resolution to complaints they have received from consumers about the continuing problem of network access.
New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco and Wisconsin state Attorney General Jim Doyle are in discussions with AOL, spokesmen said.
Since AOL switched its more than $7 million members to unlimited access for $19.95 a month, its network has been deluged by subscribers, many of whom cannot log onto the system during peak evening hours or on weekends.
A spokeswoman for the Dulles, Va.-based company could not immediately comment on the New York lawsuits, but on Tuesday, AOL said it was upgrading its network and that it understood its users' frustration.
"Although we understand the frustration some members are experiencing ... the average AOL member gets more value under unlimited pricing than ever before," AOL said in response to the Los Angeles lawsuit.
One of the New York lawsuits, filed by the law firm of Goodkind Labaton Rudoff &amp; Sucharow LLP, represents four AOL members.
"Anyone who has tried to access AOL and its Internet service recently knows there is an interminably long wait and that the company is not providing what it has promised to its subscribers," attorney Edward Labaton said in a statement.
"It is particularly damaging to the millions of those who have been promised unlimited access on AOL for $19.95 per month and cannot benefit from the contractual obligation America Online has with them," he continued.
The lawsuit claims breach of contract, unjust enrichment, deceptive trade practices and false advertising by AOL. An AOL spokeswoman said she had not yet seen the lawsuit.
The other lawsuit was filed Monday by Wechsler Harwood Halebian and Feffer in New York, representing one user, Ezra Graber. This lawsuit seeks to recover damages due to breach of contract for failure to provide services.
Peter Zinman, an attorney for Goodkind Labaton Rudoff &amp; Sucharow, said their lawsuit is separate from the one filed in Los Angeles but that all the cases could be consolidated into one class action.
"I would predict that there would be many suits filed all over the country," said Zinman.

AT&amp;T Corp. -- a year after the much-hyped launch of its Internet access service had consumers clamouring for software -- said Wednesday it will end its introductory offer of free Internet access to long-distance customers.
The telecommunications giant said that after March 31 a revised pricing plan for its WorldNet Service will go into effect, but that it will continue to offer its flat-rate pricing plan of $19.95 a month for unlimited access.
AT&amp;T also said it began posting statistics about the reliability and performance of WorldNet. It challenged other service providers to match its performance, a jab at America Online Inc., which has experienced major congestion problems when its members swamped the service after it switched to flat-rate pricing in December.
"We always said it would be a one-year promotion," Tom Evslin, vice president of WorldNet, told reporters in a conference call. "It served its purpose of introducing many people to the Internet.
"Things were very different a year ago. Now, you can't turn on a sports event without seeing the URL of each team," he said, referring to World Wide Web site addresses known as uniform resource locators (URLs).
WorldNet has more than 750,000 members and said it is the largest "pure Internet" access provider in the United States. "Pure Internet" services offer Internet access only and little or no proprietary content like that provided by America Online Inc. and CompuServe Corp.
Starting March 31, AT&amp;T will offer long-distance customers who sign up for WorldNet and anticipate lower usage a monthly rate of $4.95 for their first five hours.
Long-distance customers who signed up before March 31 will continue to get their first five hours for free for a year and will be enrolled under the revised pricing after that.
Customers of long-distance carriers other than AT&amp;T can receive the service for $4.95 for the first three hours.
All hourly plan customers pay $2.50 for each additional hour and pay separately for phone access or toll-free 800 number access to reach the service.
When AT&amp;T introduced WorldNet with flat-rate pricing a year ago, it shocked the online services industry, which feared competition from the telecommuniations giant with access to so many long-distance telephone customers.
But still, analysts said that AT&amp;T must be disappointed with its current subscriber count of over 750,000, since its entry into the online services was so feared and analysts estimated it would rapidly gain millions of users.
By contrast, No. 1 online service AOL has over 8 million subscribers.
"It's safe to say they must be disappointed with their subscriber growth," said Gregory Wester, a research director at the Yankee Group. "They have a 60 percent share of the long-distance market and a single-digit share of Internet access mareket." Wester uses 18 million users as the current number of the total Internet access market.
AT&amp;T stock dropped 37.5 cents to $40.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Software giant Microsoft Corp. Thursday unveiled the highly anticipated version of its next-generation software for office computers, called Office 97.
Office 97 -- a package of software that includes popular programmes such as Microsoft Word for word processing, the Excel spreadsheet programme, Access database software and the PowerPoint presentation programme -- has many new features, including document collaboration and the ability to jump seamlessly from a document or spreadsheet to the Internet.
"Office is a centrepiece of Microsoft's Internet strategy," Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said at a New York news conference.
The software giant, which has 55 million users of Microsoft Office applications, said it had already received advance orders from nearly 10,000 retail outlets for Office 97. The software became available in stores Thursday.
The company said 3 million copies had been sold through corporate licensing agreements.
Industry analysts noted, however, that many large business users of Microsoft's Office software have not upgraded to the Windows 95 or Windows NT operating systems required by Office 97.
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said more than 80 percent of the improvements in Office were a result of customer feedback.
"Our investments in understanding the needs of customers and our continued ability to deliver exciting enhancements are the cornerstone of Office's ongoing success," Gates said.
Gates launched the software at a media event at New York's Lincoln Centre.
Microsoft dominates the office suite category of software, with a 90 percent market share, according to International Data Corp., a market research firm based in Framingham, Mass.
But it faces increasingly aggressive competition from Canada's Corel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus unit and its SmartSuite software.
Corel, which uses WordPerfect word-processing software as the core of its office software, made a significant dent in Microsoft's retail market share in the second half of last year, according to industry analysts.
"While SmartSuite and Corel are eating away at things like price and Internet features, Microsoft's message to corporations is, 'Guys, it's the ease of use and the cost of ownership,'" said Eric Brown, a Forrester Research analyst.
Microsoft said with some of its new features in Office 97, such as the Office Assistant, users can easily get answers from a built-in software "guru" without burdening their information systems managers. Tools such as Network Installation Wizard, Office Resource Kit and others make it easier for information system managers to install and manage the software.
"I'd not be surprised if we reduced the cost of ownership by one-third to one-half," said Dennis Tevlin, Microsoft's director of product marketing, desktop applications.
Since Sun Microsystems Inc., International Business Machines Corp., and others have introduced lower-cost network computers, one feature they have touted is the low cost of ownership of these new devices vs. the higher cost of maintaining PCs and their hefty software.
Office is a huge cash generator for Microsoft. Its desktop applications group, which is dominated by Office, is expected to bring in about $5 billion of the company's fiscal 1997 revenues, which are estimated at slightly over $10 billion, according to Wall Street analysts.
The standard edition of Office 97 for upgrades from earlier versions of the software has an estimated retail price of $209. It will sell for $249 for upgrading from non-Microsoft suites and $499 for new users.
One new component in Office 97 is called Microsoft Outlook, a desktop information manager. Outlook helps users manage information, track documents and communicate.
By integrating e-mail, scheduling, contact management, task management and a module for tracking documents and events, Outlook acts as a central "hub" for Office 97.
Gates said one of his favourite features of Outlook is its e-mail filtering capability, which enables him to immediately read and answer important e-mail amid the flood of e-mail messages he receives daily from around the world.
Other features include Internet technologies that make it easy for users to create "hyperlinks" linking their documents to a World Wide Web site, for example. Users can also search Office and Web-style documents on a corporate network and they can navigate documents using the familiar tools of a Web browser.
"We like to call this activating the Web," Tevlin said. "1996 was the year of the lots of Internet infrastructure products. Office 97 is the first in this new wave of Web applications."
Microsoft's stock gained $1.50 to $86.125 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

International Business Machines Corp said its $23 billion Global Services business is to become a separate IBM group, acknowledging the significance of the fast-growing business.
In a related development, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner reiterated in the company's annual report on Wednesday that the company planned to hire "thousands more" employees to fuel growth, most of them in Global Services.
IBM told analysts earlier this year it would probably add as many new employees in 1997 as it did in 1996, with a big chunk in Global Services.
In 1996, the computer giant's worldwide headcount grew to 241,000, up from 225,000 in 1995, mostly due to the expanding services business, an IBM spokesman said. In 1995, employment grew from 220,000 in 1994, the first time employment had grown in 10 years.
"I'd like to add here that I am very happy -- and proud -- that our transformation has created job growth," Gerstner said in his letter to shareholders, in which he described 1996 overall as "a solid year."
When Gerstner first took over the then-struggling computer giant in April 1993, one of his first actions was to take a big restructuring charge and cut 25,000 jobs from IBM.
The Global Services unit -- which designs, installs and services computers, including running entire corporate computer systems -- was formerly part of IBM's Sales and Services group.
Sales and Services will be renamed the Sales and Distribution Group, still headed by IBM Senior Vice President Ned Lautenbach.
IBM also said Dennie Welsh, who was general manager of Global Services, will be promoted to a senior vice president and report directly to Gerstner.
Welsh was also named an IBM group executive and will join IBM's executive committee, which makes strategic decisions.
"The time is right for this change," Gerstner said in an IBM memo announcing the reorganisation. "He (Welsh) and his colleagues on the services team have done an outstanding job building a great new business for IBM. This change not only reflects a logical adjustment in our organisational structure, but also a recognition of their success."
IBM's services business has been its fastest growing in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter, IBM said services revenues jumped 22 percent to $5 billion. In comparison, IBM's total revenues grew 6 percent in the fourth quarter.
"This is a transformation of the IBM company," said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based consultant. "The major revenue stream is not coming from hardware, it will come from software and services ...".
"This has some impact on the way IBM sees its future," Albert added. "Anything this important demands direct oversight by Gerstner."
Wednesday's move follows changes in December when IBM consolidated computer services under the IBM Global Services brand. IBM's services organisation had been operating in some countries outside the United States under different names.
The addition of Global Services now gives IBM five major corporate divisions. The others are the Software Group, the Server Group, which makes the computers that run networks; the Personal Systems Group; and Sales and Distribution.
With Welsh's promotion to IBM senior vice president, the company now has a total of 10 senior vice presidents.
IBM stock fell $1.50 to $137.857 on the New York Stock Exchange.

International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday reported higher fourth quarter profits, bolstered by its strong services and software sales, but some analysts were disappointed about sluggish mainframe sales and lower-than-expected restructuring costs.
The world's largest computer maker said net income rose about 18 percent to $2.02 billion in the quarter from $1.71 billion in the 1995 quarter. Revenues were up 6 percent, to $23.1 billion, from $21.9 billion a year ago.
Earnings per share rose to $3.93 from $3.09, since IBM had 7 percent fewer shares outstanding in the quarter due to stock buybacks. Wall Street analysts had expected profits of $3.88 a share on average, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates.
"They were mixed results, software and services were great," said David Takata, a Gruntal &amp; Co. analyst.
He said weak mainframe computer revenues were disappointing. Some analysts had been predicting better mainframe revenues in the quarter due to strong new products.
The sluggish mainframe sales and lower-than-expected restructuring costs, however, lead some analysts to call the quarter a disappointment after attending a meeting of IBM executives and analysts in New York.
"It was disappointing, but not disastrous," said Barry Bosak, a Smith Barney analyst. "They are facing challenges, (but) it is not pulling the company down like it was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We'd like to see more growth and we are not getting it."
"The quarter looked a little light," said Daniel Ries, a Nomura Securities analyst. "They took a smaller than expected charge... and the tax rate was lower than what everyone was using. I think they missed the number slightly.
For the quarter, IBM's restructuring costs were $200 million, less than previous estimates of between $300-$400 million. IBM said restructuring costs in 1997 would reach about the same level as total costs of $720 million in 1996.
G. Richard Thoman, IBM's chief financial officer, told analysts IBM spent less than planned on restructuring mostly because of its European operations. "In Europe once again, we were unable to achieve success in voluntary (staff) reductions," he said referring to IBM's employee buyout plans.
The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer maker said service revenues jumped 22 percent in the quarter and personal computer sales rose, but sales of mainframes fell and RS/6000 workstations were flat.
Software revenues rose 4 percent in the quarter, and hardware sales increased 2 percent. IBM said its sales of Lotus Notes reached a record of 1.5 million licenses in the quarter, bring the total of Notes licenses to 9 million.
Personal computers were also a bright spot for IBM, but they carry lower product margins.
Thoman said IBM's PC business showed continued improvements, with its profit margin closing in on Compaq Computer Corp.'s margins, which are about 23 percent of revenues, the best in the industry. But he declined to give provide specifics about unit shipments or gross margins.
IBM's total gross profit margins fell in the quarter to 40.3 percent of revenues vs. 41.7 percent a year ago.
"We showed good growth in the fourth quarter despite a difficult year-over-year comparison, continued weakness in Europe and a greater-than-expected currency impact," IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner said in a statement.
"Although we still face many challenges, IBM is a much different company than it was only a few years ago," he said, noting IBM's services business accounted for 21 percent of revenues at the end of 1996 compared to 13 percent in 1993.
The impact of converting revenues received in foreign currencies into dollars erased 3 percentage points from the fourth-quarter revenue gain, IBM said. That compared with about a two point positive impact in the 1995 quarter.
Net earnings for the year rose to $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share, from $4.2 billion, or $7.23 a share, in 1995. The 1996 results included a charge for research and development from the acquisition of Lotus Development Corp.
Full-year revenues rose 5.6 percent to $75.95 billion from $71.94 billion.
In a break with tradition, IBM released its results after the stock market closed rather than before the market opened.
The stock closed up $1 at $168 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
By region, revenues in North America rose 11 percent to $9.6 billion in the fourth quarter, Asia-Pacific rose 6 percent to $4.3 billion and Latin America gained 4.0 percent to $1.1 billion. Revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were $8.1 billion, little changed year over year.

America Online Inc. is under the gun again, amid growing member outrage due to its network overload and analysts said AOL risks losing the new users it worked hard to gain, once they cannot sign onto the service.
Last week, AOL said it would spend more to upgrade its network, as class action suits were filed against the world's largest online service in at least four states, as users complained that they are not getting the service AOL touted, when it switched members to unlimited usage for a flat fee.
Now, AOL has asked users to cut back on prime-time usage.
"If you sit there and think about it, this is an absolutely unbelievable strategy," said Roger McNamee, a partner at Integral Partners, a fund in Menlo Park, Calif, at a conference last week. "Every customer is now dissatisfied."
Last week, as it tried to address its growing problems, AOL also said it would add customer service personnel, decrease its marketing such as its advertising campaign featuring the music from "The Jetsons" cartoon and mailing out free disks.
Chief Executive Steve Case made an unusual plea to subscribers, asking them to curb usage during peak hours and use "flash sessions" to read and write electronic mail offline.
"It seems like it's an admission that they are overcharging for the service," said Edward Labaton, a partner at Goodkind Labaton Rudoff &amp; Sucharow, one of the law firms that has filed a class action suit against AOL in New York.
"If you are an AOL user, you know it's a lottery now. The chances of getting online during peak hours are as good as your chances of getting four numbers in the lottery," he said.
Since AOL switched to unlimited access for $19.95 on Dec. 1, it has had record numbers of subscribers join the service, including 500,000 in December alone. Last week, its stock jumped as it reported its membership passed 8 million.
"Yes, I think they will lose some (members), but still it is a very good deal, if you want any of the proprietary content," said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications Inc., a market research firm in Bethesda, Md.
He said that national Internet access providers, such as AT&amp;T Corp.'s WorldNet service, Netcom Online Communications Inc., Mindspring Enterprises Inc. in Atlanta, may gain some users at AOL expense.
"But it won't be a stampede," Arlen said. "Do you go to the little guy with a dozen unlimited lines, or companies that have had regional overloads, like Netcom?"
"We are seeing something," said an AT&amp;T WorldNet spokesman. "In about the last three weeks, we have seen our subscriber rates double ... and we cannot account for this on the basis of our ad programs in place." The AT&amp;T spokesman said that AT&amp;T was trying to determine if the spike in subscribers was due to AOL's woes or other factors.
Currently, AT&amp;T WorldNet has 600,000 users.
Recently, on one Internet newsgroup, users complained in postings that they could not cancel their AOL accounts, because the 800 numbers were busy for hours, and e-mail requests to cancel were told to call these 800 numbers.
AOL and all the online services face a difficult economic model, analysts said, as they spend millions to build out their networks to support growing demand, because it is difficult to estimate what will be the real demand level.
"They are not totally to blame," said Lise Buyer, an analyst with T. Rowe Price. "No one has seen this kind of membership ramp-up before, they are pioneers in this area."

International Business Machines Corp. and 15 U.S. and Canadian banks announced Monday that they had formed a company to offer a broad range of electronic banking services in North America.
The company, the Integrion Financial Network, will offer interactive banking and electronic commerce services to U.S. and Canadian banks beginning early next year, IBM and the banks said.
"With this new venture, electronic commerce will take its biggest step to date," IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner told a news conference. "Integrion is the customer pathway to an array of services ... that no bank could provide alone."
Integrion will develop an electronic bill payment system and provide software to connect to its network for member banks' customers. Consumers will also be able to access the network via the Internet or any commercial online service.
Electronic commerce, in which consumers buy goods and services via computer, could grow to $600 billion a year within 10 years, Gerstner said. By contrast, electronic commerce now runs at only about $700 million a year, he said.
"The demand is there," Barnett Banks Inc. Chief Executive Charles Rice told the news conference.
Gerstner said he hoped that companies like Intuit Inc., which has its own set of deals with banks for electronic banking software, will develop versions of its popular Quicken personal financial software for Integrion.
In addition to Barnett, banks teaming up with IBM include BankAmerica Corp., the Royal Bank of Canada, Fleet Financial Group Inc. and Banc One Corp.
Integrion will be owned and operated by the member banks and IBM. It will be open to all banks in North America.
Gerstner said his company would make money from the venture by selling the services of its Global Network and other services. He said Integrion is a for-profit company but that the companies involved will make money through electronic banking services.
Gerstner was not specific on what kind of revenues IBM or any of the companies involved were expecting from the venture.
The companies said they will use the IBM Global Network as the base network for electronic banking, a proprietary network maintained by IBM and used by many corporations as their own network or to conduct commerce with other companies.
Several bankers attending the news conference said the partnership with IBM would lower the cost of developing technology for electronic banking.
The companies said the most sensitive banking transactions will run over the IBM network, which they said is more secure than the Internet, but with connections to the Net.
Gerstner said while the Internet has become a totally new communications medium in the past two years, it is still not yet the "holy grail" companies have hoped for.
"The payoff is what these institutions do with this," Gerstner said.
Other banks teaming up with IBM are ABN AMRO Bank NV, Comerica Inc., First Bank System Inc., First Chicago NBD Corp., KeyCorp., Mellon Bank Corp., Michigan National Corp., NationsBank Corp., PNC Bank and Washington Mutual Savings Bank.

America Online Inc., besieged by complaints by frustrated customers unable to log on and facing the threat of a lawsuit by at least one state, agreed Wednesday to give some members refunds or credit.
The world's largest online service, with 8 million subscribers, agreed in principle to give customers their choice of a free month online or up to $39.90 -- the cost of two months of its unlimited service -- as a result of its recent negotiations with dozens of state attorneys general.
AOL also said it planned to hold its membership at 8 million members for the short term, until it was confident it could meet the needs of its current members.
America Online Chairman Steve Case said the company had been working out a refund offer to its members and that the attorneys general in several states agreed Wednesday afternoon to support its proposed plan to members.
"We felt like today we had to move forward with our programme, with or without an agreement," Case said in an interview. "We were pleased at the final hour that the attorneys general are supporting it... It was a concern that our members were waiting for us to respond. If there hadn't been so many states involved, we could have responded a few days ago."
Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan held a news conference in Chicago, to announce the preliminary deal with the company and 36 states including Illinois, before AOL's announcement.
Ryan said he expected the Dulles, Va.-based company would formally sign the agreement by Thursday.
"We're comfortable with it. We think it's a good deal for consumers," he said.
America Online, which since Dec. 1 has been struggling to deal with an unexpectedly big surge in subscribers, also agreed to halt for a month advertising aimed at attracting new customers.
The proposed settlement headed off, for now, consumer fraud lawsuits threatened by at least one state, New York and under consideration by several other states. Several class action lawsuits have been filed against AOL, and AOL said this agreement has nothing to do with the class action lawsuits.
The agreement calls for customers to receive graduated refunds of up to $39.90 based on how much time they spent over the past two months logged onto AOL, Ryan said.
Any customer can demand a free month's service, no questions asked, but the consumer must request the credit.
"It's a way of saying thank you to our members for their support," said an AOL spokeswoman.
Case declined to estimate the cost of the refunds, but New York state Attorney General Dennis Vacco told a Manhattan news conference he expected the refunds will cost the company several million dollars in his state alone. There are 600,000 AOL members in New York state.
Wall Street analysts said they did not expect the refunds to have much of a financial impact on AOL, because it will be cutting way back on its quarterly marketing expenses, which average about $120 million to $130 million a quarter.
"Even if you make some pretty aggressive assumptions about how many people will call for refunds, then you have the number who will qualify," said Jamie Kiggen, a Cowen &amp; Co. analyst. "I come up with $10 to $15 million in terms of cash cost, which will be offset by reduced marketing expenses."
AOL moved to placate angry customers on Jan. 16, telling them it would spend $350 million to upgrade its network, $100 million more than it had announced in December.
Ryan said the pact originally covered 37 states, but said Missouri's attorney general backed out at the last minute to take a closer look at the proposed refunds.
AOL ran into capacity troubles after it switched its customers from a subscription plan based on the number of hours online to a flat $19.95 monthly rate for unlimited use.
Under the agreement announced Wednesday, AOL agreed to cease all new advertising for the month of February unless already contracted for. Vacco said any ads must include a disclaimer that congestion may prevent customers from getting online.
The prosecutors had complained America Online was continuing to advertise and sign up new customers even as it could not deliver the service to existing users.
AOL also agreed to hire additional operators to field calls from customers seeking to cancel the service, and will set up facilities to accept faxed or online requests to cancel the service. Members had complained they could not cancel.
Customers in the 36 states also could contact the attorney general's office in that state to file a refund request.
Attorneys general or their aides from 20 states met last week in Chicago with the company.
"If there are fresh complaints, we can still file a lawsuit under the consumer fraud laws," Ryan said. "This does not preclude us from acting on behalf of consumers."

International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings that were slightly better than expected, bolstered by its service business, growth in software sales and tight expense controls.
The world's largest computer maker said net income rose 17.6 percent to $2.0 billion in the quarter from $1.7 billion in the year-ago period.
Earnings per share rose faster, to $3.93 from $3.09 a share, since IBM had 7 percent fewer shares outstanding in the quarter due to stock buybacks.
Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of $3.88 a share, on average, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates.
While analysts and investors said the results looked good, some said IBM stock might come under profit-taking pressure on Wednesday.
"It's an excellent number, it's an excellent quarter. You really can't say anything bad about it. But I think it may cause a brief period of selling because Wall Street (sells) on that kind of news," said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood.
"They were mixed results, software and services were great" and European results were encouraging, said David Takata, a Gruntal &amp; Co. analyst.
But Takata said weak mainframe computer revenues were disappointing. Some analysts had been predicting mainframe revenues rose in the quarter due to strong new products.
The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer maker said service revenues jumped 22 percent in the fourth quarter and personal computer sales rose, but sales of mainframes fell.
Software revenues grew 4 percent in the quarter, and hardware sales grew 2 percent.
Revenues overall rose 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion. Expenses fell 2 percent in the quarter from the 1995 period, IBM said.
"We showed good growth in the fourth quarter despite a difficult year-over-year comparison, continued weakness in Europe and a greater-than-expected currency impact," IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner said in a statement.
Currency fluctuations cut revenues by about 3 percentage points in the quarter, compared with about a two point positive impact in the 1995 quarter, IBM said.
Net earnings for the year rose to $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share, from $4.2 billion, or $7.23 a share, in 1995. The 1996 results included a charge for research and development from the acquisition of Lotus Development Corp.
Full-year revenues rose 5.6 percent to $75.95 billion from $71.94 billion.
In a break with tradition, IBM released its results after the stock market closed rather than before the market opened.
Analysts said there was no particular significance to IBM reporting after the close. IBM was trying to avoid the drastic swings in its stock that have come during a conference call with analysts it hosts after the earnings are released.
The stock closed up $1 at $168 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

After two years of hype and euphoria about the Internet and its sweeping impact on the computer industry, a reality check is setting in as investors are asking: Where's the money?
A Tucson, Ariz., industry conference this week called PC Forum -- a "schmooze fest" once populated mostly by the upper echelon of the computer industry -- brought together telecommunications and media company leaders as well as those from computer behemoths and start-ups.
Many attendees said there is more concern now about profits and business models.
"It's now coming to practical terms," said Ed Bennett, former president of the Prodigy Services online service. "Where is the money coming from? ... But the raw potential of the industry hasn't changed, and that's a good thing."
So far, it is still not clear what type of business plan will lead to hefty revenues and profits from the Internet, whether it be advertising-based, subscription-based or some other way of making money.
Recent failures or financial problems at Web-based ventures, such as the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of American Cybercast, one of the first Web soap opera sites, are causing concern.
Executives also pointed to the recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Amazon.com, which pioneered bookselling on the Internet, for its anticipated initial public offering (IPO).
Seattle-based Amazon.com, known as one of the most successful ventures and best-known examples of Internet commerce, said it lost $5.8 million in 1996, mostly due to increased investments in technology and marketing.
"There is no question that there is an increased focus on the part of analysts and investors on when are they going to make money," said Sheldon Laube, chief technology officer of U.S. Web., a privately held Santa Clara, Calif. company which franchises Web development, training and consulting services.
"It's a healthy part of the evolution of the business," Laube said. "The hype is now evolving into reality and ultimately that is what technology is all about."
While the conference is a forum for discussing industry issues and exchanging ideas -- sometimes lofty and intellectual ones such as the use of metaphors and language to describe this new medium -- a number of small start-up companies come to make their debut before their peers. Industry executives, analysts and investors come to meet and make deals in the hallways.
This year, in the so-called "debutantes" presentations, many venture capitalists, Wall Street analysts and fund managers checked out 12 early start-ups.
The PC Forum, run by industry guru Esther Dyson, is considered such an important part of a start-up company's debut that Fast Company magazine followed around executives of two small companies to chronicle their participation at the conference.
"This is the 'Lollapalooza' of the Internet," Bennett said, who remains on Prodigy's board, referring to the alternative music festival. "Not every band is going to get signed."
This year, questions about business models dominated many start-up presentations more than the technology. During a presentation by a start-up called NetBot Inc., whose Internet "shopping assistant" made its debut, one attendee interrupted to ask about the Seattle-based firm's business model, even before the company demonstrated its software called Jango.
"People are much more pragmatic when they look at these companies," said Bruce Smith, a Merrill Lynch Internet analyst. "You like to look at companies that have thought through their business model and how they will compete with the 800-pound gorilla (Microsoft Corp.)."
And as the stocks of other publicly traded companies such as Internet search engines firms like Yahoo! Inc., Excite Inc., and Lycos Inc. ; Internet access providers; online services and other Internet software companies continue to drop on Wall Street, start-ups compete for fewer and fewer venture capital dollars.
Some promising IPO candidates are also mulling being acquired, such as PointCast Inc.'s much-rumoured discussions two weeks ago to be acquired by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the owner of the Fox television network and newspapers such as the New York Post.
PointCast, a pioneer in so-called push technology, said last week its present intention was to remain independent.
"In the venture capital business, you can see the transition from a seller's market to a buyer's market," said Roger McNamee, general partner at Integral Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. "Entrepreneurs are beginning to wonder where their next dollar of capital will come from."
Even in its new-found pragmatism, the industry remains ever optimistic about the future. Conference leader Dyson and many of the speakers gathered together at the end of the conference with the creator of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, who now heads up the World Wide Web Consortium.
"The competition is what produces the incredible rate of development," Berners-Lee said.

Fears of a U.S. interest rate hike battered Canadian financial markets this week, but Canada's top central banker gave no hint on Friday whether he might raise Canada's rates in reply to any Fed action. "There will always be an impact on Canada of an international change in interest rates," Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen told reporters after a speech to economists.
"But the difference I think now is that we have got more room to maneuver than we did before. But you should not interpret that as saying what we are going to do next week or not," he added.
The Canadian dollar and fixed income markets were rattled this week by investor concerns that the Federal Reserve would hike U.S. interest rates next Tuesday while the Bank of Canada is expected to hold rates steady.
Thiessen said nothing on Friday to ease market fears.
"He's saying inflation is under control and there is no reason for rates to rise," said Warren Jestin, chief economist for Bank of Nova Scotia.
However, economists predicted the central bank might eventually yield to pressure to tighten monetary conditions in Canada if the Canadian dollar continues to weaken.
The Bank of Canada dropped short-term interest rates 11 times last year compared with just one U.S. rate cut.
The lower rates and low inflation can be thanked for strengthening Canada's economy, Thiessen said on Friday, predicting strong growth for jobs and production in the year ahead.
"The Canadian economy should have room for strong above-potential rates of growth in output and employment in coming quarters without a resurgence in inflation," he said.
"The margin of unused capacity in our economy will shrink substantially over the next couple of years," he said.
Thiessen agreed with a Royal Bank forecast that 700,000 new jobs would be created over the next two years. And he predicted a return of consumer confidence and surging private sector growth.
Thiessen said he sees a strong Canadian dollar in the long term, citing a report on Friday of low Canadian inflation.
Canada's core consumer price index for February rose 1.5 percent on the year, according to Statistics Canada, which puts inflation well within the central bank's target inflation range of one to three percent.

Canadian mining companies are keeping a wary eye on the strengthening Canadian dollar, which threatens to bruise their earnings and cash flow.
"As the Canadian dollar strengthens, it hurts us," said Vic Wells, spokesman for Anvil Range Mining Corp., which cited the stronger currency as a factor that forced the company to suspend zinc and lead mining at its Faro property in Canada's Yukon last December.
Analysts are forecasting a surge in the Canadian currency in 1997, with some predicting the unit to rise to 80 U.S. cents from its current 74 U.S. cent range.
"It'll take the cream off, that's for sure," said George Miller, president of the Mining Association of Canada.
Canada is the world's largest producer of potash, uranium and zinc, the world's second-biggest producer of nickel after Russia and an important source of copper.
Companies that produce metal mainly in Canada are especially hit by the currency strengthening against the U.S. dollar because producers must pay their operating costs in Canadian dollars. But most companies' revenues come in U.S. dollars, the currency in which most metals trade.
"Currency gets full-time attention here," said Alan Thomas, chief financial officer of Noranda Inc..
A change of one U.S. cent in the Canadian dollar translates into C$20 million ($14.8 million) on Noranda's bottom line, Thomas said. The currency rose about three-quarters of a U.S. cent in 1996, costing Noranda about C$15 million ($11.1 million), he said.
"So for '96, there's not a big change. But if the dollar continues to go up, it will have a bigger effect," he said.
"All our costs are in Canadian dollars -- the salaries we pay, the supplies we buy, the rent we pay. All our products are priced in U.S. dollars and they're priced the same regardless of the exchange rate," Thomas said.
Companies such as Alcan Aluminium Ltd., with most production outside Canada, are not as exposed to harm from a stronger currency since they pay most of their operating costs in U.S. dollars, analysts said.
But for companies such as Inco Ltd. and Falconbridge Ltd., which produce most of their nickel in Canada, a stronger dollar will take its toll.
Falconbridge figures a one-cent change in the Canadian dollar would knock C$7 million ($5.2 million) off its bottom line, even with the company's substantial currency hedging programme.
While Falconbridge operations in the Dominican Republic and Norway would not be affected by a stronger Canadian currency, about two-thirds of the company's operating costs originate in Canada, said Chief Financial Officer Lars-Eric Johansson.
Inco estimated that every one-cent change in the Canadian dollar amounted to a $9 million pre-tax hit despite currency hedging. But the company earned $179 million in 1996 on revenues of $3.1 billion, so small movements in the Canadian dollar do not have a huge effect, said Inco Chief Financial Officer Tony Munday.
"It's not going to kill us," he said.
Still, some mining analysts said the effects of a stronger Canadian dollar must be understood in context.
"With a rising dollar, it usually means metal prices are going up as well," said base metal analyst David Davidson with CIBC Wood Gundy in Toronto.

With the ruling Liberals far ahead in the polls, the biggest question in the campaign for Canada's June 2 federal election is not who will win but which opposition party will place second.
"It's an election that's quite unlike what you see in other Western countries because there really is no realistic option (aside from the Liberals)," Reg Whitaker, a political scientist at York University in Toronto, said recently.
"The opposition parties are fighting for small markets. It's wide open for the Liberals."
Despite opposition criticism of the Liberals' record on national unity, unemployment and taxes, polls show the Liberal party with a consistently strong lead.
The official opposition since the last election in 1993 has been the Bloc Quebecois, whose sole aim is promoting Quebec independence, not forming a federal government. "They want to put themselves out of business," Whitaker said. "So right off you have a bizarre situation."
Prime Minister Jean Chretien called the June 2 election on Sunday. In the last election in 1993, the Liberals won 177 out of 295 seats, the Bloc Quebecois 54 seats, the Reform Party 52, the New Democrats nine and the Conservatives two. One independent was elected.
Unless one of two right-wing parties -- the Conservatives and Reform -- can consolidate nationwide support, analysts said, the Bloc was poised to be the official opposition again, keeping the Quebec sovereignty issue on the front burner.
Reform, with strong roots in western Canada but feeble support elsewhere, has painted itself as the only party that can hold the Liberals accountable. But it stops short of seeking the role of government for now.
"Our ultimate objective is to get a Reform government," party leader Preston Manning said recently. But when asked about his immediate goal, he said he wanted to win enough seats to form the official opposition.
"They're mainly concerned about holding on to what they've got," Whitaker said. Reform had 50 seats when the House of Commons was dissolved on Sunday.
The Conservatives, led by Quebecker Jean Charest, stubbornly maintain they can form the next government, but the right-leaning party has a long way to go. In 1993 the party, one of the oldest in Canada and the ruling party from 1984 to 1993, lost all but two of its seats in the House of Commons.
"They have some severe limitations," Whitaker said. "You see the Conservative Party and the Reform Party fighting over the same right-wing margins."
Reform and the Conservatives are both campaigning on smaller government and tax cuts as ways to fix Canada's persistent unemployment problem. The Conservatives, however, stand to gain in Quebec, while Reform has no base in the French-speaking province.
A poll in Quebec released on Monday showed support for the Liberals at 37 percent, the Bloc at 35 percent and the Conservatives at 25 percent.
Alone on Canada's left wing is the New Democratic Party, which makes no claims to forming a government.
"Federally, we've never made a government, but we've always been there to make a difference," NDP leader Alexa McDonough said as she launched her campaign last weekend.
But the Liberals have co-opted the NDP too, appealing to moderate left-wing Canadians with talk of preserving health care, social programmes and the national pension system, and promoting Liberal legislation on gun control.

Trade ministers from 18 Asia- Pacific countries were urged to support renewed talks for free and open trade in financial services, official documents showed on Friday.
In the documents, senior officials requested that ministers at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Montreal "note the successful re-launch of the financial services negotiations."  
The officials said that "while recognizing that flexibility may be needed with regard to transition periods for some participants, (we) urge all APEC participants in these negotiations to strive toward achieveing a permanent, most favored nation-based agreement by December 1997."
Trade ministers from Canada, the United States, the European Union and Japan announced in Toronto last week that they would push negotiations in financial services to the top of the agenda for world trade liberalization talks.
Talks broke down last year after the United States pulled out because of its disappointment in the offers from other countries.
At the Toronto meeting last week, the so-called Quad leaders urged Asia and Latin America to improve their offers to the World Trade Organization. APEC's support this week will likely be seen as a big boost for the talks.
APEC leaders were also urged to consider expanding an agreement liberalizing trade in information technologies forged last December.
APEC members should "consider the planned review of the Information Technologies Agreement with a view to the possibility of broadening participation in the agreement to all APEC members," the document said.
The United States and the European Union have said they hoped China, in particular, would join the agreement as a major step toward China's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
In the document, senior officials also asked the trade ministers to complete the implementation of the recent agreement to open telecommunications markets by January 1, 1998.
APEC includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

Canada's French-speaking political leaders voiced anger on Friday about a new pre-election ad that suggested Quebec-born politicians did not have what it takes to keep Quebec from leaving Canada.
"The suggestion that where you are born should determine whether or not you should be prime minister of the country is to say the least offensive," a sombre Jean Charest, leader of the Conservative Party, told reporters in Ottawa.
The ad, promoting the right-wing Reform Party, shows three French-speaking Canadian party leaders -- including Canadian Prime Minister and Liberal leader Jean Chretien -- along with Quebec Premier and leading separatist Lucien Bouchard.
As the ad calls for "a voice for all Canadians, not just Quebec politicians," the images of the four Quebeckers are circled in red and then each face is crossed out.
Canada has had Quebec prime ministers for 19 of the last 20 years -- Quebec has a crucial one-quarter of the population -- and Chretien led Canada in an October 1995 referendum that Quebec sovereigntists lost by only one point.
Three of the five political leaders contesting the June 2 election are from Quebec: Charest, Chretien and the leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe.
Aside from Reform's Preston Manning, from the West, the New Democratic Party's Alexa McDonough is the only non-Quebecker to lead a major political party in this campaign.
"Mr. Manning is setting a very bad example," the normally upbeat Charest said, looking troubled. "He's sending a message here that one part of the country doesn't count."
Chretien declared in Niagara Falls: "I want to tell Mr. Manning that people don't like his divisiveness."
Manning, who advocates decentralization to please both Quebec and other provinces, contends the traditional parties have failed to devise a method to keep Canada together.
"The separatists do damage by what they do. The old-line federalists do damage by what they do not do, the plan that they do not have, the alternative model they do not have, the strategies they do not have for the next referendum.
"We're saying each is equally dangerous in its own way to the unity of the country."
But Manning -- running second in the polls outside Quebec -- has no voter base in Quebec and a poll released on Friday showed the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois neck-and-neck in the vote-rich French-speaking province.
It was not clear how his strategy would play across the country, but as often before in this 36-day campaign, he managed to get other politicians talking about his issues.
"It can divide the country. What he is doing I think is an act of desperation," said one Liberal voter, retired engineer Bal Sandhu of from the western city of Edmonton, Alberta.
But many voters are sick of the Quebec issue coming up again and again and think Quebec manages to get a disproportionate share of Ottawa's attention.
"They get more opportunities than the rest of the country, because the government is bending over backwards to try and keep them in the confederation," a disenchanted Edmonton technologist, John Mushka, said in a phone interview.
Charest has been rising steadily in popularity since televised leadership debates last week which put national unity at the center of the election campaign.
He is on an intense two-day tour of Quebec to build momentum, with a keen eye on forming the official opposition. The Bloc Quebecois fills that role, giving Canada an official opposition whose goal is to break up the country.
The Reform Party, with its strong support in Western Canada, also has hopes of forming the official opposition.
The stakes are high for Charest, who is personally popular but whose party suffers from a turbulent past. The Tories fell to only two seats in the 1993 election after controlling the government for eight years. And former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is reviled across Canada.

Canada's French-language televised debate for the June 2 federal election was cut short suddenly on Tuesday when the moderator collapsed, leaving the five political party leaders stunned.
Moderator Claire Lamarche, a television personality in French-speaking Quebec, fell out of her chair moaning about the heat in the room just as the five political party leaders were about to attack the key election issue of national unity.
"We decided together that the debate should not continue under the circumstances," Arnold Amber, one of organizers of the debate, said in a hastily arranged news conference. "All the parties are in agreement with this."
The party leaders left without speaking to the media.
Canadians had expected a lively debate on how to handle the troubling issue of Quebec independence. But the moderator's collapse made the abbreviated exchange anti-climactic, said political scientist Ken McRoberts at York University in Toronto.
"There might have been some dramatic moments in the exchange over the response to a (pro-sovereignty vote)," McRoberts said in a phone interview from Toronto. "So (separatist Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles) Duceppe must be quite frustrated."
Duceppe, a francophone, was sidelined in the English debate on Monday night but observers expected him to use the French-language debate to rally the separatist forces and gather support for his waning campaign.
The debate was about two hours into its scheduled 2-1/2 hours when the moderator collapsed, just as Prime Minister Jean Chretien was asked if he would recognize a vote in favor of Quebec sovereignty if it were by a slim margin.
In 1995, people in French-speaking Quebec voted 50.6 percent against Quebec separation, while 49.4 percent voted in favor of separation, prompting federalist forces to claim victory.
But instead of exploring how the next government would handle an expected referendum on sovereignty next year, the debate focused on Canada's high unemployment rate, robbing Duceppe of the chance to stir up much nationalist spirit.
"You decreased the deficit on the backs of the poor," Duceppe accused the prime minister.
But Chretien, much feistier in the French debate than in Monday night's English debate, fended off his competitors time and again, speaking about his party's economic record.
Unemployment, especially among young Canadians "is a very serious problem," Chretien said. "However, first you have to have an economy which creates jobs, and this is the reason why we have to get rid of the deficit."
Under Chretien's Liberals, the budget deficit has been cut back from about C$42 billion (US$30.3 billion) in 1993 to a projected 1996 defecit of C$16 billion (US$11.5 billion). But Canada's unemployment rate has hovered stubbornly between nine and 10 percent for much of Liberals' term.
Chretien, Duceppe and Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest -- the three francophone leaders -- spent much of the evening trying to show their parties had Quebec's best interests at heart.
The two anglophone leaders -- Preston Manning, the leader of the right-wing Reform Party, and Alexa McDonough, who heads the left-leaning New Democratic Party -- were marginalized by their poor French.
Over the two days of debates, Charest appears to have fared better than the other leaders. "My sense is that Charest shone, as he did (Monday) night," McRoberts said. "He is very articulate and very well prepared."
Charest's leadership has already translated into a surge in his popularity in Quebec. A recent poll indicated he was the most popular of federal party leaders in Quebec.
The Progressive Conservatives have a long way to go, however. They currently hold only two of 295 seats in the House of Commons after being decimated in the last federal election.
The Liberals have a huge lead in opinion polls, with the backing of between 42 and 47 percent of decided voters.

Inmet Mining Corp chief executive Bill James has one focus for the company he has led for the past six months: Antamina.
The huge copper and zinc discovery in Peru holds a resource of at least 400 million tonnes of ore, but the deposit requires at least US$1.5 billion to develop. Inmet shares the deposit 50-50 with Rio Algom Ltd.
"We're going to focus on Antamina and hopefully that will turn out to be a very profitable mine," James said on Friday in an interview.
"Our trick is going to be to finance it. We have very limited cash flow right now," he said. "It'll be a difficult situation. But we're going to do it."
How?
"Well, at some stage we'll probably do some underwritings and we'll sell off some assets. With the combination of that, we think we can handle our share," James said, springing out of his chair and pacing the room.
"We're going to do it," he bellowed, shaking his clenched fists above his head. "We are definitely going to do it."
But James is not starting from a position of strength. The copper, zinc and gold company posted a 1996 loss of C$364 million -- one million dollars for every day of the year, as James puts it.
"Nobody would call that too healthy."
James, 68, who is still officially chief executive at Denison Mines Ltd, was brought to Inmet last September to turn around the company. Denison would likely name a successor next week, said James, a former chief executive of Falconbridge Ltd.
Since James took the Inmet helm, the company has written down C$355 million in assets, including its solution mining at Copper Range in Michigan and its Bougrine zinc and lead mine in Tunisia.
It also wrote off a big chunk of its investment in the Izok Lake copper and zinc prospect in Canada's Northwest Territories and its investment at the Cayeli copper and zinc project in Turkey.
The company also faces low grades and rising costs at its young Troilus gold mine in northern Quebec.
A recent study on the Petaquilla copper-gold exploration property in Panama showed the project would probably not be economic under current conditions. Inmet has 48 percent of the project, with Teck Corp holding 26 percent and the rest held by Adrian Resources Ltd.
James would not say which assets were for sale. But he said he was sure the company could get at least book value or C$17 million for its stake in Petaquilla, "a little bit" for Bougrine and at least C$25 million for Izok Lake.
"We're not in any rush to sell these things off and we don't want anyone going around these properties kicking tires," he warned.
The company has C$185 million in the bank and would not need to fund Antamina for two or three more years, he said.
Inmet shares were up 0.05 to 8.85 in Toronto, down from a 52-week high of 11.13.

As Canada's budget deficit shrinks, politicians campaigning ahead of June elections are debating whether to cut taxes or raise government spending.
While many Canadians say they are desperate for tax relief, others are begging politicians to shun tax cuts and spend the extra money on social services.
"They have to stop talking about cutting taxes," one Toronto social worker said as Reform party leader and tax cut advocate Preston Manning spoke nearby at the kickoff of his campaign for the June 2 election.
"People want to hear about jobs and job creation. If you have a job you worry about keeping it, you worry about losing it," she told the Canadian Press news agency. Canada's unemployment rate is a stubbornly high 9.3 percent.
The governing Liberals on Sunday called for the June vote, just 3-1/2 years into their five-year term.
The two right-wing parties, Reform and the Conservatives, are touting their plans to cut taxes.
Canada has the highest personal income taxes among the seven leading industrial nations and the fourth highest among the member nations of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, according to an OECD study.
"(Conservative leader) Jean Charest believes that high taxes kill jobs -- that the economy needs tax cuts now to create jobs," the Conservatives' campaign literature says.
Reform lashed out at Liberal tax increases, accusing the centrist party of pushing through 31 tax hikes while in office. Reform has promised to cut payroll taxes and contributions to unemployment insurance, as well as simplify the income tax system.
In 1996, the average Canadian family's tax bill was about 48 percent of its income, a study released on Tuesday showed.
But the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) opposes tax cuts, saying right-wing platforms are irresponsible. The NDP actually wants to raise corporate and capital gains taxes.
The separatist Bloc Quebecois wants Ottawa to close tax loopholes for big business, while giving tax breaks to smaller firms to stimulate growth.
The Liberals are sandwiched between the right's call for tax cuts and the left's call for spending, and face different opinions in their own ranks on the issue.
They have taken a typical middle-of-the-road approach, advocating tax cuts once the deficit is licked and when health care and education are securely funded.
"The choice the other political parties are offering is to declare the job done before it truly is, to introduce a tax cut before the country can afford it," Finance Minister Paul Martin told a Montreal news conference on Tuesday.
"They would short-change our hopes for a stronger economy and for greater job creation."
Martin said his party would lower taxes but only when the deficit was eliminated. Instead, his party announced on Monday they would not cut C$6 billion (US$4.3 billion) in health care funding, as had been planned.
Martin has predicted the deficit for the year ended March 31, 1997, would be less than C$16 billion ($11.4 billion), well below the original target of C$24.3 billion ($17.4 billion) for the year.
But the Conservatives argue that 87 percent of the deficit decline was due to higher taxes. They say real after-tax income has fallen from the early 1990s.

Canada hopes Asia-Pacific trade ministers in Montreal for trade talks will forge a consensus to target environmental products and services as an area for trade liberalisation.
"Environmental goods and services and technologies is one (sector) that I particularly favour," Canadian Trade Minister Art Eggleton said Thursday, the first day of a three-day meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
Analysts said Eggleton is under pressure to make sure the APEC trade ministers have something concrete to show at the end of their meeting, held to set the agenda for an APEC summit in Vancouver, British Columbia, in November.
Environmental technologies is an area where Canada should find it easy to gather support, said senior Canadian trade officials.
"It tends to get a rather positive echo around the circuit," said one official who asked not to be identified.
Last year, the 18 APEC members kick-started a worldwide agreement on liberalising the information technology market, Eggleton said, and he hopes APEC can play a similar role this year in at least one sector.
"There's a lot of pressure (to announce concrete progress)," Karen Minden, director of the APEC Studies Foundation for Canada, said in a telephone interview. "People in the organisation have said if APEC doesn't catch the leaders' attention, then it won't get anywhere."
Canada is this year's chair for APEC, and wants to show the world in November that the huge forum, which includes some of the world's richest countries as well as many developing countries, can be productive.
Previous summits have been long on trade liberalisation rhetoric but slow to promote free trade measures, critics charge.
"This will be the meeting that gets things started," Eggleton told reporters. "I expect what we're going to announce is that we're moving forward and developing an agenda for the November meeting that will help ensure we'll come out of this Canada Year for APEC with some very solid accomplishments."
He said he also hopes the trade ministers will discuss implementing country-specific trade liberalisation action plans put together by each of the 18 members last year.
"If we come out of this meeting having named one or two sectors, then we will have done well," a senior trade official said.
While U.S. officials said earlier this week they hoped to use the APEC meeting to test the waters for tariff cuts on wood and paper products, Canadian officials were not optimistic progress would be made in that sector.
"There are some sensitivities here," said the official. He said Canada would love to eliminate all tariffs in wood and paper trade, but APEC was divided on the issue.
Officials said they also hoped to make progress on streamlining customs regulations, which often cost small and medium-sized businesses crucial time and money in international trade.
"For these people, (customs red tape is) not merely an inconvenience like it is for big business," an official said. "It's a block."
As the APEC trade ministers prepared for their first dinner together Thursday, Canadian labour leaders called on them to focus on human rights in Indonesia.
The labour leaders said they opposed the imprisonment of Muchtar Pakpahan, an Indonesian trade union leader and dissident. The Canadians cited a letter from U.S. President Clinton conveying his disapproval of Pakpahan's jailing, and they urged Canadian officials to follow suit.
Eggleton said he would discuss human rights with Indonesia if the two countries could arrange a bilateral meeting.
APEC aims to achieve free and open trade and investment in the region among developed countries by 2010 and among all member countries by 2020.
APEC's members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

Canada's Barrick Gold Corp. appeared to regain the upper hand on Tuesday in the perplexing fight for control of the massive Busang gold find in Indonesia.
Barrick said on Tuesday that a letter from the Indonesian government supported a proposed joint venture between Barrick and Bre-X Minerals Ltd., the Calgary, Alberta-based company that discovered Busang.
But the letter made plain that the government's blessing was conditional on satisfying the demands of Bre-X's Indonesian partners -- PT Askatindo Karya Mineral and PT Amsya Lyna -- within a month, Barrick said.
"The main thing here is that the government has reaffirmed its support of Barrick's participation," Barrick spokesman Vince Borg told Reuters. "This is a very significant step forward."
The Indonesian government told Barrick and Bre-X last November to agree on a joint venture to develop Busang. The companies submitted a proposal to the government in December, asking for clarification on a few issues.
However, delays in completing the agreement prompted Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc. to make a $5 billion counter-proposal for Bre-X last week. Under Placer's rival bid, 40 percent of Busang would go to Indonesian interests. The letter from the Indonesian government received this week by Barrick and Bre-X addressed only their joint venture proposal and mentioned nothing about the Placer Dome offer.
Barrick gave little weight to Placer Dome's rival proposal after receiving the letter. "I don't see how the Placer proposal can at all affect the progress we'll be making in reaching a final agreement," Borg said.
Placer was undaunted. "We don't see it like that," Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver. "We have a creative and compelling proposal on the table and we expect it will succeed."
Meanwhile, Barrick said the Indonesian government had offered to help Bre-X sort out its relationships with its Indonesian partners and analysts believe Askatindo is the key to forging a successful deal between Barrick and Bre-X.
Askatindo, which has a 10 percent stake in the richest parts of Busang, is controlled by the Syakareni family and Muhammad "Bob" Hasan, a close associate of Indonesian President Suharto. Hasan bought a 50 percent stake in Askatindo earlier this month.
"The Indonesian people are looking for a bigger participation," observed one Toronto-based gold mining analyst.
Others said Bre-X, Barrick and the Indonesian government were being pressured to work out a way to give Askatindo a larger share of Busang.
In its letter, the government stipulated that Barrick and its partners should get 67.5 percent of a new company that would develop Busang. Bre-X and its partners would keep 22.5 percent and the Indonesian government would get 10 percent.
It was unclear whether Askatindo's portion was included in Bre-X's 22.5 percent.
"That's what we have to work out with Bre-X and Askatindo," Borg said.
Bre-X officials did not return telephone calls asking for comment.

Not content with disturbing your meals with sales calls, AT&amp;T Corp. will soon have salespeople arriving on your doorstep to explain why you should switch long-distance service to them.
However, they will have been invited.
The nation's dominant long-distance company on Thursday announced an alliance with Shaklee Corp. that will have Shaklee's 500,000 sales agents selling AT&amp;T phone service face-to-face across the nation from January 1997.
The Shaklee sales representatives will sell to friends, colleagues and neighbours, never to strangers.
"Without question, this is a groundbreaking move for AT&amp;T," said Joseph Nacchio, executive vice president of AT&amp;T's consumer and small business division.
Shaklee, part of Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. of Japan, currently sells nutritional supplements, personal care products, household cleaners, and water treatment products.
It is particularly strong among ethnic minorities, non-English speakers and in inner cities. These markets can be tough to crack by other routes, but quite lucrative.
"Shaklee will help us expand our personal presence in communities exponentially and create a whole new network of representatives with roots in neighbourhoods across the country," Nacchio said.
To start with, Shaklee will sell only AT&amp;T's long-distance calling plans, but AT&amp;T wants to sell new services too once the sales force is trained on their complexities.
"AT&amp;T would like to give Shaklee that opportunity," said Shaklee spokeswoman Karin Topping.
The move shows AT&amp;T is neither too big nor too proud to take a leaf out of the marketing books of its competitors.
Small aggressive competitors like Excel Communications Inc. have powered their growth through exactly this kind of "multi-level" marketing. The approach is so named because each salesperson recruits others, and continues to benefit from their recruits' sales efforts as they rise up the hierarchy.
MCI Communications Corp. has a similar relationship with direct sales organisation Amway Corp.
"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. And it certainly validates this sales strategy," said Eric Strumingher, industry analyst at brokers Chicago Corp. "I think this could be very significant for AT&amp;T," he said.
For AT&amp;T the alliance is aimed at reaching new customers cheaply, and keeping them.
AT&amp;T's market share in the $70 billion long-distance market has sunk to about 55 percent from 90 percent over the last decade. They have been hit not only by traditional rivals MCI and Sprint Corp., but a host of tiny new competitors.
Recent attempts to regain customers by offering $100 checks have been expensive but without increasing loyalty, so Thursday's initiative marks a new departure.
"We do believe the nature of this sales channel will be much more likely to increase loyalty and retention among customers," Jack McMaster, AT&amp;T's vice president for domestic consumer long distance, said in an interview.
Shacklee salespeople sell to their friends and neighbours. Customers are expected to be more reluctant to switch away from a service recommended by a friend.
"It's potentially much more lucrative than selling lipstick or vitamin supplements for the salesperson," said David Goodtree, an analyst at consultancy Forrester Research.
Shaklee said an average salesperson earns $14,000 a year part time, with earnings ranging from $1,000 a month at the entry level to six figures for the long-established.
Shaklee said that cars and vacations would typically be incentives for upper echelon sales representatives.
For AT&amp;T a crucial question will be the value of the customers won in terms of their long-distance spending, and the chances of selling new services like satellite television, pagers or mobile phones to them too.
AT&amp;T wants all of Shacklee's half million salespeople to be involved with the programme, which means they must be AT&amp;T customers themselves.
"It is our ambition that all of them will participate in this programme," McMaster said.
This will mean a boost of several hundred thousand good customers who will not be able to switch, even before the sales effort gets underway.
"Thats one of the reasons we are so excited about this," McMaster said.
AT&amp;T's stock edged down 12.5 cents to $37.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

At the end of this month, AT&amp;T Corp. will finally untether Lucent Technologies Inc. as a separate company, a year after the telecommunications behemoth first said it would split into three businesses.
For some of AT&amp;T's 3.3 million shareholders -- it has more than any other U.S. corporation -- it may be a confusing time.
Telecom equipment maker Lucent already had an initial public offering of stock in April, but on Sept. 17 AT&amp;T stock will be shorn of the rights to the remaining 82.4 percent of Lucent shares.
AT&amp;T will then made up only of the telecommunications services and computing businesses. The last part of the three way split-up will be around the end of 1996, when shareholders receive stock in computing company NCR.
Existing shareholders on Sept. 30 will receive one new Lucent share for about every three AT&amp;T shares they hold, and if they intend to hold both stocks, they need do nothing.
But the confusion arises because of the necessity to create two new classes of stock -- one for the rump portion of AT&amp;T and one for Lucent -- in the weeks leading up to the  Sept. 30 split.
The New York Stock Exchange said that these classes of temporary "when issued" stock -- which are rights to the respective new shares -- will effectively form a market in the new companies before formal trading begins.
"AT&amp;T has done a pretty good job of keeping people informed. But inevitably there will be some confusion," said Michael Macleod, a vice president and partner at Shareholders Communications Corp., which specializes in shareholder issues and odd-lot stock programs.
For example, someone selling 100 AT&amp;T shares between Sept. 17 and 30 will in effect be selling rights to 100 new AT&amp;T shares, and rights to just over 30 Lucent shares, although the total proceeds will be the same.
Buyers in that period will be able roughly to reconstruct the old AT&amp;T by buying rights in the same 100 to 30 proportion, or they can buy AT&amp;T or Lucent rights as they see fit. Sellers also can dispose of rights to just one stock and keep the other during that period.
No date has yet been set for the creation of the "when issued" stock. AT&amp;T "when issued" will be allocated the trading symbol T wd.N, a NYSE spokesman said.
It will not entitle you to any Lucent shares, nor to AT&amp;T's regular 33-cent quarterly dividend, even if it is possible to buy it before the AT&amp;T dividend record date of Sept. 12. On Sept. 30, the AT&amp;T stock symbol will revert to T.N.
The "when issued" stock in Lucent (LU wi.N) will carry no rights to Lucent's dividend of 7-1/2 cents a share even if it starts trading before the record date of Sept. 12. At Sept. 30 it will revert to the stock symbol LU.N.
The worst confusion will come for those people who still own stock from the pre-1984 split-up of the Bell system.
"A majority of shareholders -- though representing a small minority of the overall stock held -- still have the original pre-1984 AT&amp;T stock which includes rights to regional Bells," said AT&amp;T spokeswoman Eileen Connolly.
If these shareholders want to sell, working out the stock rights and especially the costs for capital gains taxes, could be very complex.
AT&amp;T's 24-hour shareholder information line is 1-800-756-8500.

Citizens Utilities Co said on Thursday that it is aiming to be among the largest eight or 10 U.S. telephone companies by the year 2000, by buying up companies in small but important local telephone markets across the United States.
"We are looking at acquisitions of this type every day," Ronald Spears vice president for Citizens' telecom sector told Reuters in an interview.

Rural U.S. wireless firms expect to be able to keep on growing rapidly without facing the blitz from new Personal Communications Services (PCS) rivals that has affected their cellular cousins in big cities.
"We believe strongly that PCS is an urban-based phenomenon," John Stanton, chief executive of Western Wireless Corp told an investor conference.
CommNet Cellular Inc, 360 Communications Co, Palmer Wireless Inc and Vanguard Cellular Systems Inc all expect to benefit to some degree.  
"I would think that PCS players will not enter the less densely populated rural markets for some time," said Steven Yanis, an analyst at Salomon Bros, which hosted the conference.
Wireless stocks have been depressed all year, missing out on the big Wall Street boom, despite big increases in subscriber numbers, revenues and improving cash flows.
The reason is simply fears of the effects of competition from aggressive PCS companies, who are driven by monstrous debt burdens to grab market share aggressively.  
In most big city markets, there will be five wireless competitors by 1999 instead of two. The fear is that aggressive price cutting or expensive advertising will trip up the carefully balanced discounted cash flow business models which share and bondholders are relying on.
"If you add up the market share projections by the PCS and wireless companies (in most cities) they exceed 100 percent," said David Roddy, chief telecommunications economist at Deloitte and Touche Consulting.  
But for rural cellular providers, PCS will be slow to arrive, with little built before 2000, and there will be less of a threat to revenue and subscriber growth.
"Population density is critical to understanding competitive threats," said Arnold Pohs, chief executive of CommNet Cellular.
PCS, operating at a higher frequency than cellular, would need more transmitters to cover rural areas and it would be a marginal proposition. However for densely peopled urban areas it offered a perfect solution.  
"PCS is a capacity-based business while cellular is a coverage-based business," said Western Wireless's Stanton.
Comnet, whose home territories include North and South Dakota, finds they are not financial badlands. It had almost 60 percent growth in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization in the year to end-June and customer turnover, or "churn," of only 2.2 percent.
There will even be revenue opportunities for rural cellular companies as PCS customers travel through their areas, or "roam," and need a connection.
"We will gain a lot on roaming agreements as dual mode handsets come into play," Pohs said.
Dual mode handsets will handle both cellular and PCS frequencies to allow customers to stay in touch nationally even if their provider does not own a network in every area.

Like any marriage, the $20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp. and British Telecommunications Plc may be smoothed by the experiences of the two-year courtship that preceded it.
"I may be an incurable romantic, but I think this is going to be a lot easier than people think," one BT insider said.
Concert, the name of the planned merged company, was the original name for a global communications offspring conceived by the two companies in July 1994 to provide a one-stop shop for multinational corporations.
While the executives atop the new merged company have a clear vision of where they are going, insiders and industry sources say the acid test will be how the engine rooms of networks, billing, support and customer service are melded.
Concert, now called Concert Communication Services, was a wayward child in the early days, and progress was slowed by turf wars and bickering about which standard or system to use.
"Some of those turf wars were really destructive," said Daniel Briere, a consultant at TeleChoice Inc., who has worked with Concert Communications and its parents.
A computer and software system to support prepaid Concert calling cards in Britain was delayed many months while BT and MCI managers each fought to have their own design used.
Similarly, a videophone product developed by BT for MCI failed on both sides of the Atlantic at a cost of millions of dollars.
"This huge 'hands across the water' friendship never worked in practice that I saw," Briere said.
However, sources inside both companies believe the tough decisions have already been made and that a unified management can more easily fix the remainder precisely because of the experience they already have in working together.
"Those debates by and large are behind us," said MCI chief engineering officer Fred Briggs. "A unified management always shortens the decision-making process some."
"It may sound weird, but you take out the need for cooperation (in a merger)," TeleChoice's Briere said. "You can choose the best and discard the rest."
Concert Communications is already producing evidence of this. The venture has $1.5 billion of revenue under contract and has networks active in 800 cities in 50 countries.
It has a head start over rival alliances Global One and Unisource, backed by Sprint Corp. and AT&amp;T Corp., respectively.
Some analysts see a danger of wrangles being duplicated across the entire company as senior management attempt to fuse two corporations with such widely different roots.
BT began as a government-owned monopoly while MCI cut its teeth fighting a onetime monopoly, AT&amp;T. BT controls 90 percent of the British market while MCI has struggled for 20 percent of the U.S. long-distance market.
The size of the combined company makes some worry that MCI's nimbleness and aggressiveness will be lost.
The new Concert will be one of the three largest telephone companies in the world, with revenues of $42 billion, 183,000 employees and a pro-forma market capitalisation of $54 billion.
"Customers will expect a lot more from MCI now it is on an equal footing with AT&amp;T. It will be harder for MCI to retain that scrappy, upstart image," said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.
Potential flashpoints could be the need to use BT billing and support systems to help pry open the $90 billion a year U.S. local calling markets. Though MCI has advanced billing systems, it has never had to cope with this scale of attack.
A second may be international calling. BT and MCI plan to replicate calling plans like MCI's Friends and Family, which was used to great effect within the United States, to cement customer ties on both sides of the Atlantic.
"There are plans in the works for that sort of thing," said the BT insider, who declined to be identified.
But BT has never had to administer calling plans of the complexity that MCI has used, which generate a very high level of customer service queries.
The two companies also plan to use Britain as a conduit for grabbing international business calling from continental Europe and route it through London to the United States.
Another major issue is what type of technology to use to bring Internet and multimedia applications to U.S. homes. BT is expected to be closely involved as a pioneer in so-called broadband technologies.
"That is going to be a major decision," MCI's Briggs said.
Even though the top executives work very well together, they do not always have perfect judgment.
Briere said MCI's two biggest previous alliances, a $2 billion media alliance with News Corp. and the $1 billion takeover of Canada's SHL Systemhouse, both in 1995, have not produced the benefits expected.
"Both News Corp. and SHL have failed to meet investment expectations," said Briere.

Wireless wholesaler Nextwave Telecommunications Inc is to set its delayed initial public offering in the next two weeks, finally bringing to fruition a fund-raising exercise of breathtaking ambition.
Nextwave, an unknown in the industry until it began bidding in 1996's C-band Personal Communications Services (PCS) auctions, has spent a staggering $4.7 billion on wireless licenses for the third largest network in the U.S.
"We expect to file an amended S1 to the SEC in the next couple of weeks," said a source close to the company.
The company planned to go public last summer, but after a series of delays finally came to a parting with lead manager Merrill Lynch in the fall. It must now amend the S1 document it sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Revised documents are not yet finalised, but Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers are set to be co-lead managers of the $200 million equity offering and CIBC Wood Gundy is leading the $300 million debt offering, the source said.
Nextwave declined to comment ahead of the re-filing, and the source declined to be identified.
Nextwave's total outlay may top $8 billion, when the $3-3.5 billion cost to build the network is included.
The build-out is covered by $1.4 billion in unconditional vendor financing from companies such as Lucent Technologies Inc and Hughes Networks Systems, and another $2.1 billion in conditional vendor financing.
"The cost of the system is, as you can see, fully funded," the source said.
Some analysts have been spooked by the huge debt Nextwave is taking on and see the wireless market as being dangerously overcrowded already. Nextwave, however, is sanguine.
"The company has pre-sold 35 billion network minutes of use. To put it in perspective, that is equal to the entire U.S. cellular industry's 1994 traffic," the source said.
While Nextwave has huge debts, it will not incur the massive advertising, marketing and customer acquisition costs incurred by its clients and their rivals as they duel in the market place for fickle customers.
Nextwave sees its success being backed by the 30 percent plus growth in U.S. wireless usage, and the low costs to get its retail customers into that market.
The company has 21 customers, headed by MCI Communications Corp, which in August entered a 10-year agreement to take 10 billion minutes of use on the network.
Nextwave is essentially offering off-the-shelf digital wireless service to any reseller that could want it.
These already include long distance and local telephone firms who need wireless to bundle with their wired offerings, other wireless firms which have holes in their own license coverage and electric utilities who see a future in telecom.
But potential users could embrace any firm with a strong brand and market presences.
These could include retailers like Wal Mart Stores Inc which already sell consumer telecom devices, or companies like Walt Disney Co if it decided to offer a kids phone service under its brand name, the source said.
Nextwave shareholders include Qualcomm Inc -- the inventor of the digital technology CDMA that is used on the network -- Sony Corp , NTT Corp, and Korea Electric Power Corp, plus institutions like ING Capital, Triumph Capital and Kingdon Capital.
The foreign ownership is 22 percent. No shareholder has more than five percent of the company.
Nextwave says doubters should judged it by the quality of its backers.
"Look at the names of the companies allied with us. Why would you put up the money unless you knew it would work? You have more than your reputation on the line," the source said.

AT&amp;T Corp, after recording a $200 million rise in bad debt and uncollectibles in the fourth quarter, sees a need for an industrywide drive to crack down on customers who fail to pay their telephone bills.
"It used to be if you don't pay your phone bill, you didn't get phone service. Now with multiple suppliers, we can shut off their service, but they can go someplace else to get service," Chief Financial Officer Richard Miller said Wednesday.  
The extra $200 million was the main reason AT&amp;T fell short of consensus estimates for the fourth quarter, analysts said.
AT&amp;T's operating net was $0.76 against $0.68 in the year-earlier period and adrift of the $0.79 First Call consensus.
"We think there are some behaviors that are beginning to emerge that we need to work on as an industry," Miller told Reuters in an interview.
"The majority of the problems we had in 1996 were in the business market, but we are also seeing increased uncollectibles in the consumer area," he said.  
There were increases in business fraud, delinquency and bankruptcies during the period, AT&amp;T said.
"We studied this in the fourth quarter and concluded we need to step up our ongoing provisioning. As we take on receivables, we allocate a certain proportion to bad debts or uncollectibles," he said.
"Half the $200 million was catch-up for (underprovisioning in) the past and the other represented what we were incurring in the fourth quarter," Miller said.  
In 1996, AT&amp;T had $9 billion of account receivables plus $7.1 billion of financial receivables. Of these it put a total $1.3 billion into allowances including uncollectibles.
Miller said the $100 million extra in the fourth quarter should be seen in the context of this overall figure.
Worldnet, AT&amp;T's Internet access service launched in 1996, ended the year with 568,000 subscribers, but added fewer in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.
"Were close to being on our plan on online services...in a brand new industry that is very dynamic that is quite remarkable," he said.  
He would make no predictions for when it might break even.
Miller said the company planned to market Worldnet aggressively, and the results of that effort would be seen in the first quarter.

Four regional Bell telephone companies reported strong fourth-quarter results Tuesday, riding a wave of demand for extra phone lines, wireless phones and "smartphone" services like caller ID.
Two sets of merger partners -- Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. and SBC Communications Inc. and Pacific Telesis Group -- all produced results fairly close to analysts increasingly ambitious expectations.
"These companies have clearly raised the bar on expectations for demand growth. It should be sustainable for 1997," said analyst Richard Klugman of brokers PaineWebber.
The Bells have been powered by the mushrooming demand for phone lines to link home computers to the Internet, falling costs of mobile phone service, which has lured more users; and by technology to get more from a phone call -- call waiting, caller ID and call management systems.
Even the companies are surprised by the market's power.
"I'm amazed by how much momentum we have. Frankly, its in advance of our business plans, and its due to both the healthy economy and an overall exploding telecom marketplace," SBC Chief Financial Officer Don Kiernan said in an interview.
However, the Bells' stocks continue to be subdued, as investors worry about who will win when regional Bells and long-distance companies follow the lead of telecommunications deregulation and enter each others' markets later this year.
Nynex Corp. said its net income rose 10 percent to $416.5 million, or 95 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $378.7 million, or 88 cents a share, in the 1995 period.
Revenue edged up 0.9 percent to $3.33 billion from $3.30 billion, the New York-based company said. It was reduced by a change in accounting for directory revenues, the assessment of prior-period service rebates and Nynex's decision not to stimulate certain markets while it was in the process of improving services.
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. said its profits, depressed by one-time items, fell to $346 million, or 79 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $392 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion.
Excluding onetime gains and losses, however, Bell Atlantic's operating income rose 7.3 percent to $424 million from $395 million.
"We posted strong gains in our key communications markets in 1996 as we prepare to complete our merger with Nynex in 1997," said Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond Smith.
The two companies agreed to merge in April 1996, hoping to create a company with over $50 billion in market value. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of March.
For the year, Bell Atlantic earned $1.88 billion, or $4.28 a share, on revenue of $13.1 billion. In 1995, it earned $1.86 billion, or $4.24 a share, on sales of $13.4 billion.
"Both Bell Atlantic and Nynex reported better-than-expected results compared to analysts' consensus," said Bill Vogel, analyst at brokers Dillon Reed.
"Bell Atlantic had a very strong and robust quarter. There were quite a few charges in the quarter, but fundamental volumes of the business are at or above expectations," he said. "For NYNEX it was the first back-to-back years with double-digit earnings growth."
SBC Communications Inc., parent of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., said its net income rose 4.8 percent to $542.9 million, or 90 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from $517.8 million, or 85 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
"Our outstanding financial performance was driven by excellent results by our wire line and wireless businesses, as strong demand and effective marketing led to the addition of a total of 1.5 million customer lines during the year," said Edward Whitacre Jr., chairman of the San Antonio, Texas-based company.
Pacific Telesis reported profits of $191 million, or 45 cents a share, before one-time adjustments, down from $233 million, or 54 cents a share, last year. Excluding adjustments, net income rose to $282 million, or 66 cents a share.
The parent of San Francisco-based Pacific Bell said its earnings before adjustments were driven by expanding business in data delivery and new custom calling services, as well as increases in access line and minutes-of-use volume.
Nynex closed unchanged at $50.375, Bell Atlantic fell 25 cents to to $67, SBC fell 25 cents to $52.50, and Pacific Telesis rose 12.5 cents to $37.75, all on the New York Stock Exchange.

Labour unions at beleaguered French carmaker Renault SA said on Monday that they were calling for a one-hour strike at all Renault plants in France, Belgium and Spain.
This was in reaction to an announcement last week that of Renault's Vilvoorde plant near Brussels would close and reports that job will go in France, they said in a statement.
Earlier a Renault spokeswoman said chairman Louis Schweitzer had agreed to meet staff this week at the Belgian plant, where 3,100 jobs will go, but the time and place were not set.
Last Thursday's surprise announcement by the privatised car firm that it would close Vilvoorde stirred a political storm at home and abroad, and a denunciation from Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.
The Renault spokeswoman had no comment on newspaper reports that it was preparing to announce some 3,000 job cuts in France this year. But an industry source said somewhat fewer than 3,000 posts would go in 1997.
An official with the CGT union said Schweitzer was also expected to make a rare appearance at a staff works meeting in France on Thursday.
"Schweitzer has let it be known that he'll explain the situation the company finds itself in on Thursday at an extraordinary staff works council meeting," the official with the Communist-led CGT, Renault's biggest union, told Reuters.
Renault's troubles were highlighted by statistics showing new car sales in France slid 24.6 percent last month after tumbling 33.6 percent in January.
The two-month drop reflected the market's weakness since a French state rebate programme, which had underpinned demand, ended in September.
Faced with declining demand and gross overcapacity, Renault is being forced to cut production but must do so without French government support.
With French unemployment at 12.7 percent and a general election due next year, the centre-right government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe has refused to back a plan to cut 40,000 jobs in the car industry over six years.
French radio and newspapers gave blanket coverage to the labour dispute, with Le Figaro newspaper quoting the economy minister for Belgium's Flemish region as saying the closure was "an act of economic terrorism".
Thousands of workers from Renault Belgium, supported by steelworkers, marched through Brussels to protest against the shutdown which is expected to save 825 million French francs ($144 million) a year. Belgian workers called for a Renault boycott.
But on the French stock market, brokers said the company had to reduce output and restructure. Renault stock was down 4.02 percent at 141 francs at 1243 GMT, but that was due to profit-taking as the shares have risen 20 percent since last Wednesday.
"The big problem in the auto sector is overcapacity, a problem which no-one has dared to touch for 20 years for obvious labour reasons," said a broker. "The fact that Renault is tackling it is a good sign."
Renault shed 1,641 jobs last year and 1,735 in 1995.
Newspapers said charges for the job-cutting plans, on top of an operating loss at the group estimated at two billion francs or more, would result in a full year loss of more than five billion francs for the group in 1996.
The car firm was privatised in stages in 1994 and 1996.
Renault has four assembly plants in France, two in Spain, one in Portugal and one in Slovenia.

France said on Friday it would not allow Britain's General Electric Co Plc (GEC) to bid for the state's stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF for national security reasons.
But GEC indicated that it had not given up, saying it was talking to two French companies which will be allowed to bid -- electronics-to-publishing group Lagardere Groupe and Alcatel Alsthom, an electronics and engineering company.
The Finance Ministry said it had received offers for the 58 percent stake from Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom, which is bidding with defence company Dassault Industrie.
"The government has declared as admissable the proposals by Lagardere Groupe and the one by Alcatel Alsthom and Dassault Industrie," the Ministry said in a statement.
"However, because the sale to a foreign company of more than 50 percent of the share capital of Thomson-CSF goes against the interests of national security, the proposal by GEC has not been admitted," it added.
GEC said it regretted the rejection but said it was in talks with both Lagardere and Alcatel.
London analysts say it was never likely GEC would be allowed to win the tender over French companies. But they say it might yet gain a stake by teaming up with a French partner.
In London, GEC said in a statement that the French government had encouraged it to open talks with Lagardere and Alsthom. It gave no further details.
GEC said it had bid for Thomson because it believed it could be brought together with GEC-Marconi to create a world leader in defence electronics and enable Europe to compete better with U.S. companies.
"The fragmented structure of the European defence electronics industry will not sustain a strong competitive position in world markets in the next century," it said.
"This can be achieved only through an integrated electronics defence capability efficient in its operations and effective in the deployment of its resources," GEC said.
In Paris, the ministry said the government had encouraged the accepted candidates to set out their plans for French and European industrial partnerships when they submitted final offers for Thomson-CSF.
Firm offers are due by May 7 and the government hopes to make a decision by the end of June.
One defence consultant in Paris said that GEC's bid had been a bold move to "flush out" France's strategy in its defence restructuring.
GEC and other British firms wanted to know whether e France was ready for a transnational restructuring, which would build European groups strong enough to compete with U.S. giants such as Lockheed Martin and merger partners Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
That integrated model could include the Airbus Industrie civil aircraft consortium, which groups France's Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa) and Casa of Spain.
The alternative was more modest collaboration with joint ventures. "It's about control," said the consultant, who requested anonymity. GEC's move had been a test of whether the French were willing to give up their 51 percent majority in defence companies.
The answer came back loud and clear on Friday: no.
An investment banker close to the Thomson-CSF sale said GEC was in a strong position as it had ties to both Lagardere and Alcatel. It could, for example, negotiate a big slice of Thomson-CSF after the company was sold to one of the French companies.
Last year, Lagardere and its South Korean ally Daewoo Electronics won the bidding for Thomson-CSF's then parent, Thomson SA , beating Alcatel.
Thomson SA controls consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM).
But the government suspended the deal in December after the independent Privatisation Commission objected to the terms of TMM's sale to Daewoo.

Even before Cie de Suez head Gerard Mestrallet has confirmed he is considering a merger with utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux, the market is already betting that will run the new group.
Brokers, fed by newspaper reports and market rumours, are convinced financial conglomerate Suez and Lyonnaise will merge to create a utilities group with an estimated market capitalisation of 79 billion francs ($13.9 billion) that will give new life to both companies.
A decision on who would head a merged group could play a key role in determining which company gains the upper hand in running the combined entity.
Two elements argue for the merger. Suez, after selling key assets to make good property losses, has a big cash hoard and 50 billion francs in capital -- but little industrial identity.
And at Lyonnaise, chairman Jerome Monod, 66, is preparing his retirement. A merger would not only financially strengthen the company but give fresh leadership.
Odds are heavily in favour of Mestrallet who took over Suez two years ago after a boardroom battle ousted then chairman Gerard Worms. Mestrallet was brought in from Suez's Belgian unit Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB).
"He's the favourite," said an analyst, who declined to be named. "He has done an impressive job."
"Mestrallet has shown his worth," an investment banker said.
He sold key assets including investment bank Banque Indosuez and is credited for bringing Suez back to profit.
The company made a 1995 net attributable loss of 3.96 billion francs, due to provisions for property losses, but analysts expect it to report a 1996 net profit of about 1.15 billion francs.
Mestrallet has narrowed Suez's focus to utilities, held through its Tractebel subsidiary owned by SGB. But the company has been left with an "identity problem".
Suez had become a "piggy bank," stuffed with cash and equity capital, while Lyonnaise needs funds to finance its expansion.
Mestrallet, 47, son of a shopkeeper, graduated from the elite Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) and worked as chief of staff to Jacques Delors at the French Finance Ministry before his boss became president of the European Commission.
His rival for power is Guy de Panafieu, the number two to Monod at Lyonnaise.
De Panafieu, 53, is also a graduate of ENA, the fast-track school for senior posts in government and industry. He managed the integration of the troubled Dumez construction firm since its 1990 acquisition by Lyonnaise.
But de Panafieu, although seen as having handled Dumez well, is too closely identified with Monod, the analyst said.
"I do not really see it. He is in Monod's shadow and it is not in the spirit of the times to continue the same line."
In buying Dumez, Lyonnaise inherited foreign contracts which cost hundreds of millions in provisions as disputes grew. Lyonnaise, already struggling with property losses, had to sell assets to fund provisions for those contract disputes.
"The company has lost time and has sold everything. It does not have a lot of asset support", said the analyst.
One outside contender is Christine Morin-Postel, who heads Suez's Credisuez unit, and who negotiated the sale of four billion francs of property loans to the Whitehall Street "vulture fund" led by broker Goldman Sachs.
The sale, among the biggest in French real estate disposals, is seen as the key to bringing Suez back into profit.
Morin-Postel, 50, also knows Lyonnaise well, having held the international development post and a directorship in the GTM Entrepose construction subsidiary. Last July, British leisure group Rank Organisation Plc made Morin-Postel a non-executive director. ($ = 5.689 French Francs)

French pharmaceuticals and beauty products firm Sanofi on Tuesday posted a 1996 net profit rise of 11 percent, helped by a return to profit in the beauty sector in the second half of the year.
The company announced net earnings for the full year 1996 of 1.74 billion francs ($308 million), compared to 1.58 billion a year ago, on sales of 23.65 billion, which were up three percent.
Earnings per share rose eight percent to 16.80.  Analysts had been expecting an average earnings per share figure of 17.3 francs, according to Edinburg Financial Publishing, and 17.1 francs according to Jacques Chahine Finance in Paris.
The year was "satisfactory", finance director Jean-Claude Leroy told a news conference.
It was marked by the continued high level of research efforts. That is right in line with our policy for the short term which is progressing nicely and preparation for the long term through research," he added.
Healthcare sales rose five percent but turnover in the beauty segment fell by the same percentage, he said.
The overall profit rise was helped by "major success in the clinical development of new products in the healthcare sector," the group said.
There had been very weak economic growth in Europe, with the exception of Britain, and that had resulted in increased competition, Sanofi said in a statement with its results.
In the beauty segment, selective distribution of luxury goods was hit by that sluggish consumption and sales for the sector fell five percent to 3.8 billion francs on a like-for-like basis from 1995. There were no new beauty product launches last year.
But the sector, after a 74 million loss in the first half, posted operating profit for the second half close to that of the year-ago period. In the full year operating profit was 236 million francs, against 331 million in 1995.
Yves Rocher posted growth in both sales and net earnings while Nina Ricci reported declines in sales and earnings due to difficulties in the industry, Sanofi said.
Leroy said sales of Yves Saint Laurent fell two percent to 2.8 billion francs, while Roger &amp; Gallet's turnover was under 300 million francs. Sales from Oscar de la Renta were above the 300 million level while Van Cleef &amp; Arpels was close to that.
In healthcare, pharmaceutical sales continued to grow in all geographic areas, except in the United States where there was competition from generic products. Diagnostics saw sales up four percent, hindered by difficult market conditions.
Healthcare operating profit rose 5.5 percent to 3.7 billion francs after taking in account higher research and development spending. Research accounted for 16 percent of group turnover.
The year was marked by relative stability of the French franc in comparison with other major world currencies, with the exception of the Japanese yen.
Net debt to equity ratio at the end of 1996 was 11 percent versus 13 percent a year ago. Cashflow rose 12 percent to 3.1 billion francs.
The group, 38-percent held by oil major Elf Aquitaine, had previously forecast a 10 percent rise in 1996 net profit. It gave no forecast for 1997 profit and the 1996 dividend would be set at the board meeting due on March 20.

Rival bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere Group are expected to put in final offers on Wednesday to meet the government's timetable in the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF.
A source close to telecommunications giant Alcatel said on Monday the final offer would confirm the terms of its joint bid with privately-held Dassault Industries.
Alcatel has held talks with Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) over cooperation if it won Thomson-CSF but these were "not binding on the French government," the source said. Dasa has said it is talking to Alcatel and Lagardere.
But the larger issue is what deals the British heavyweight defence firm General Electric Company Plc (GEC) has discussed with the two French contenders, the source said.
Dasa, while ambitious for a bigger role in European defence, is smaller than GEC, which is Britain's largest defence electronics group and a major rival to Alcatel in world markets.
Alcatel has to be more careful in negotiating with GEC, the source said.
Although the French government ruled out GEC as a candidate in the Thomson-CSF sale, saying it went against national security interests to sell more than 50 percent of the firm to a foreign company, it encouraged Lagardere and Alcatel to talk to GEC in preparing their bids.
Analysts believe GEC knew it would not be allowed to make its own bid but used the opportunity to serve notice that it wants a share of the business plan with whoever wins.
The government's sale terms and conditions are centred on creating a strong group around Thomson-CSF with the widest possible industrial participation and with a European dimension.
"The prospects for restructuring the defence industry in a European context will be taken into account by the government. The two candidates know that," Industry Minister Franck Borotra told reporters on Monday.
"Alcatel won't do it at any cost," the source close to Alcatel said. While the Thomson-CSF deal is important to developing Alcatel's business, chairman Serge Tchuruk does not want it so badly as to make "dangerous concessions".
A source close to Lagardere said neither Lagardere nor Alcatel would bid for Thomson-CSF at any price.
Lagardere has close ties with both GEC and British Aerospace Plc (BAe). It has a satellite joint venture with GEC through Matra Marconi Space and a missile venture with BAe in Matra-BAe Dynamics.
Alcatel is partners with GEC in GEC Alsthom, the power engineering joint venture.
The government has said it would hold to the timetable on the Thomson-CSF sale despite a pending parliamentary election which pushed back the partial privatisation of France Telecom by a month. The state expects to choose the buyer of Thomson-CSF by June 30.
Socialist leader Lionel Jospin, campaigning against the RPR/UDF centre-right coalition, said on April 22 he opposed further privatisations, saying "if Thomson is to be sold for one franc, honestly that is not what we want to do."
The government was forced into privatising Thomson-CSF separately from the Thomson SA electronics group when the independent Privatisation Commission threw out last year the government's preferred bid by Lagardere.
Lagardere wanted to buy the whole group for one franc and re-sell the loss-making consumer goods arm Thomson Multimedia for a symbolic one franc to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.

Talk of a merger between the Airbus European passenger plane venture and U.S. aerospace giant Lockheed Martin was premature but the two groups do have interests which would benefit from a link up, Airbus's French partner said on Saturday.
"It's premature," Aerospatiale vice president for corporate communications Patrice Kreis said when asked about a report in the London Times newspaper which said Airbus Industrie and Lockheed Martin were in merger talks.
"Airbus's interests and Lockheed's interests are to merge (eventually)," he said, in the face of a pending merger by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The merged Boeing-McDonnell group "want not only to dominate the market but to take it over completely," he said.
But it was too early to talk about linking up Airbus with Lockheed as European aerospace and defence companies needed to consolidate among themselves, before tackling a transatlantic merger, he said. "There's a lot of work to do," he added.
Among the key steps to be taken are current moves to changing Airbus's partnership into a limited liability company. But that should occur in the context of a rationalisation of European civil and military aviation, space and weapons systems, he said.
"Airbus on its own will not survive. Everything is linked -- civilian aircraft, military aircraft, space and weapons systems," he said. The creation in the United States of titans such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, which embrace all these sectors, is forcing Europe to do the same.
The European consolidation would be through changes in capital at the parent-company level rather than cooperation on specific projects favoured in the past.
Important steps are being taken in France in the restructuring, with a merger of state-owned Aerospatiale and combat-plane maker Dassault Aviation, and the privatisation of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF, both due to be realised this year.
Aerospatiale's chairman Yves Michot has said he was talking to Lockheed to collaborate with Airbus on specific projects.
Lockheed could become a partner in the crucial Airbus project to build a 555-seater plane, the A3XX, to rival Boeing's monopoly of the large capacity segment with its 747 jumbo.
Aerospatiale had no comment on the timing of any Lockheed decision to join the A3XX project, which has already signed up Italy's Alenia, part of the Finmecanicca group, and Saab of Sweden as potential risk-sharing partners.
Lockheed Martin and Aerospatiale both have interests in civil and military aircraft -- Lockheed makes fuselages for Boeing passenger planes, makes large military transports, and is also a prime contractor for the U.S. new-generation F22 fighter.
Aerospatiale makes Airbus cockpit systems and assembles the planes at its plant in Toulouse, southwestern France. It is also a key partner in the planned European Future Large Aircraft (FLA) military transport.
British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG and Casa of Spain are the other Airbus partners working on changing it to an integrated company by 1999.

French defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF, soon to be sold by the state, posted 1996 results on Wednesday showing a return to profit after three years of heavy losses.
Thomson-CSF reported a net attributable profit of 745 million francs ($129 million) compared with a net loss of 791 million for 1995. Sales were up 2.2 percent at 36.27 billion.
The return to the black was mainly due to the sale of Thomson-CSF's 19 percent stake in the troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.
"Thomson-CSF has been able to return to a profitable footing, as the bank no longer weighs on the accounts of the company, which is now completely centred on defence electronics," chairman Marcel Roulet told an analysts' meeting.
The state, after a bungled first attempt, is trying to privatise Thomson-CSF as part of a defence industry restructuring which may have an impact on the entire European sector.
Roulet said he expected the terms and conditions drawn up by the government on the privatisation would be published soon. "It is a question of a few days or a week." The Privatisation Commission has to vet the terms to allow the sale to go ahead.
French engineering and telecommunications giant Alcatel Alsthom has teamed up with fighter-aircraft maker Dassault Aviation and state-owned Aerospatiale to bid for Thomson-CSF.
Missiles-to-publishing group Lagardere is also bidding, supported by British Aerospace Plc (BAe).
Thomson-CSF said in a statement that operating profit rose 5.6 percent to 2.07 billion francs despite a reduction in military budgets and tougher markets. The improvement was due to better competitiveness following restructuring efforts pursued over a number of years.
The net result was dented by an exceptional charge of 824 million francs, compared with 753 million in the prior year, to cover restructuring costs tied to the shrinking of markets and cost-cutting measures, it said.
Pre-tax pre-exceptional profit rose 12 percent to 2.04 billion francs, reflecting the productivity gains and lower financial charges. Financial costs fell to 27 million francs from 135 million, due to lower interest rates and favourable currency movements.
Consolidated pretax profit was 1.30 billion francs, versus a loss of 437 million, which included a 101 million franc hit from its the sale of its holding in Credit Lyonnais.
The previous three years' losses at Thomson-CSF were essentially due to falls in the value of Credit Lyonnais shares, which were taken on Thomson-CSF's accounts to reflect its equity stake.
Europe, excluding France, contributed more than 10 billion francs in sales for the first time, compared with less than four billion in 1995. "The European market accounts for 28 percent of the consolidated turnover, against only 10 percent at the end of the 1980s," it said, adding this was due to its policy of external growth through acquisitions.
Its holding in profitable semiconductor maker SGS-Thomson contributed 588 million francs, up from 477 million in 1995. Net debt fell to 900 million from 2.3 billion.
With an order book worth more than 67 billion francs at the end of 1996, the firm should see an increase in turnover over last year on a like-for-like basis, it said.
Thomson-CSF stock closed up 1.55 percent at 196 francs, while the market was up 0.55 percent.

The restructuring of France's defence sector and the key role of state-owned Aerospatiale in the process are complicating moves by the European Airbus consortium to become a limited liability company, analysts say.
The four national firms in Airbus Industrie are studying the best way to convert the partnership into a faster, more efficient company able to compete with U.S. rival Boeing Co, which is merging with McDonnell Douglas Corp.
Aerospatiale, the French partner in the Airbus passenger plane venture, is also involved in two deals at the heart of France's defence industry consolidation -- the merger of Aerospatiale and combat plane-maker Dassault Aviation and the privatisation of electronics firm Thomson-CSF.
"It is consistent with French strategic thinking that you must first get your house in order, then negotiate from a position of strength," said an industry executive.
"Aerospatiale cannot do this today in the Airbus system. It has to have weight behind it. It will have that weight when the Dassault merger is complete," he added.
DASSAULT MERGER WILL BOOST AEROSPATIALE
The Dassault merger, due to be agreed this year, will add 13 billion francs ($2.2 billion) of annual turnover to Aerospatiale, creating a group with combined sales of 64 billion and giving Aerospatiale greater clout at the Airbus negotiating table.
A banker close to the Airbus talks said Aerospatiale is seen as the weakest of the senior Airbus partners -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa). Casa of Spain makes up the fourth Airbus partner.
But Aerospatiale will get an injection of aggressive, private-sector management with the Dassault merger.
Aerospatiale executives complain bitterly that the foreign media does not give them due credit for their industrial restructuring which turned the company round to post a 1996 net attributable profit of 812 million francs, after years of losses, and recorded sales of 51 billion francs.
Their exasperation is palpable when they say their public sector tag is seen as a weakness when compared to the private sector BAe and Dasa.
But analysts point out that Aerospatiale was slower in attacking its cost structure and still needs to improve.
BAe underwent drastic pruning in the early 1990s, going from an empire with property, cars and military interests to a group focused on defence and aerospace. It posted 1996 pretax profits of 425 million pounds ($690.3 million), on sales of 7.44 billion pounds.
Dasa, although loss-making, has the industrial and financial strength of parent Daimler-Benz AG which has set a management target of a 12 percent return on capital. Dasa posted 1996 turnover of 13 billion marks ($7.6 billion), making it smaller than BAe and Aerospatiale, but it has huge ambitions for Airbus.
A business consultant said Aerospatiale had excellent programmes, but its military projects were 30 percent more costly than those of BAe and Dasa.
THOMSON-CSF SALE ENHANCES PROSPECTS
Apart from the Dassault merger, Aerospatiale also holds a key hand in the Thomson-CSF sell-off.
The government has said bidders Alcatel Alsthom and Lagardere will have to take into account Aerospatiale's interests when putting together their offers for Thomson-CSF.
Even though Aerospatiale, as a state-controlled company, cannot take part directly in the privatisation, it will be affected by the outcome and chairman Yves Michot will give his views to the government on the rival bids.
French newspapers have reported that Michot will have to observe strict neutrality in the contest. But it is clear Alcatel's plans would significantly strengthen Aerospatiale, giving it more weight against BAe and Dasa.
If Alcatel won Thomson-CSF, it would create a missiles joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, and a satellite venture between Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF.
Lagardere has said it wants a dialogue with Aerospatiale to prepare its bid. Relations between the two firms have been strained as they compete in missiles and satellites.
"The perimeter of Aerospatiale is not yet defined," said the industry executive.
The government plans to decide on the Thomson-CSF bids by June 30.
AEROSPATIALE NEEDS AIRBUS, WILL MAKE IT WORK
Aerospatiale stands to gain from the defence moves and is in no hurry to bow to pressures from BAe and Dasa to rush into an Airbus agreement which does not suit its own interests.
However, Airbus is vitally important for Aerospatiale. Its 38 percent stake in Airbus contributed the biggest slice of 1996 operating profit, 1.175 billion francs, and around 70 percent of sales.
Analysts believe that of the Airbus big three, Aerospatiale needs Airbus the most, and that BAe and Dasa could walk away if relations broke down irreparably.
BAe has a 20 percent Airbus stake and has bigger military interests, while Dasa's parent Daimler-Benz gets most of its money from the auto business, through Mercedes trucks and cars.
Aerospatiale has, paradoxically, maximalist and minimalist aims for the new Airbus company.
For the short term, Michot argues that the present arrangement with Airbus has proved its worth, winning a third of the world market. A much bigger manufacturing concern could overstretch the management, it reasons.
In the long term however, Michot would like Airbus to have a military wing, to balance out economic cycles with government contracts.
The Airbus partners said in January they agreed in principle on the change to a single integrated company, in which the new Airbus would own its factories and design offices. Work is going on this year on valuing the assets to be vested in the new firm.
That valuation is complicated as some of the factories mix civil and military programmes, and some plants are efficient while others are uncompetitive.
One way of viewing the Airbus negotiations is through the prism of conflicting cultural visions.
"This country (France) has a vision of long-term industrial strategy. It wants to be a world power and be a dominant player in the aircraft industry," said the industry executive. Without that vision, Airbus arguably would never have got funds to launch its first plane in the early 1970s.
Set against that long-term strategic view, is the British insistence on short-term returns for shareholders, summed up as "Let the City decide". ($ = 5.790 French Francs) ($ = 0.615 British Pounds) ($ = 1.716 German Marks)

U.S. aero-engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney marked on Wednesday a revamp of global operations with the opening of a regional office in Paris to anchor a new market strategy aimed at getting closer to civil and military clients.
The office at the La Defense business district on the Paris outskirts will spearhead P&amp;W's efforts to sell the "total thrust management" concept to airlines and air forces in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Robert Wolfe, president of large commercial engines told reporters.
P&amp;W, a unit of the United Technologies Corp industrial group, aims to "integrate closely with its customers" through the regional offices which serve the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, he said.
P&amp;W makes engines for passenger planes with thrust ranging from 17,000 to 98,000 pounds, as well as combat jets such as the F15 and F16 fighters and the futuristic F22 stealth warplane.
Wolfe said P&amp;W has a 53 percent share of all engines sold on the Airbus Industrie A330 wide-body plane and 41 percent of the Boeing 777 giant twinjet.
The Hartford, Connecticut-based firm wants to expand market share by handling "all aspects of the propulsion system with the airline, to become the thrust manager" for the life of the engines, instead of just selling or leasing power plants.
That package deal would include setting up a special purpose company to buy engines and lease them to the airline. It would take charge of overhaul, repairs and maintenance -- leaving airlines to concentrate on flying passengers, Wolfe said.
The engine overhaul business is forecast to generate $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion by the end of next year, contributing about 30 percent of P&amp;W's total revenues, he said.
It is discussing the thrust management concept with airlines British Airways Plc, Swissair and Singapore Airlines, and wants to be the first to sign contracts in this area, Wolfe said.
It has already signed contracts with Delta for engine inventory management and Airbus for all engine maintenance on aircraft owned or leased by the European consortium.
Major U.S. airlines including Delta and United Airlines are also interested. "We think we have broken the ground for the first step toward full-thrust management," he said.
P&amp;W is looking at acquisitions and joint ventures among smaller firms specialising in overhaul to help boost operations. "I dare say you could see some of those occurring in the coming months," he said.
P&amp;W currently has around 15 percent of the total sales in the overhaul business in both commercial and military engines but expects to increase that "easily" to 30 percent, he said, giving no timetable.
The U.S. military is considering privatising maintenance of its park of F100 engines for the F15 and F16 aircraft, he said. And supply contracts for the F22's F119 engine stipulate the maintenance will come from P&amp;W.
Airlines stood to gain savings of 20-25 percent over the life of the engines, including the acquisition cost, while P&amp;W would be able to predict confidently the costs and margins of its products over the total life cycle.
Wolfe declined to give the margins on current business.
Industry executives have said competition for engine sales forces the leaders, P&amp;W, General Electric and Rolls-Royce Plc to sell their products on razor-thin margins, if any at all, and recoup their money on sales of spares over the 25-or-so year life of the plant.
P&amp;W expects 14,000 commercial jets to be sold in the next 20 years, with the world aviation market growing five percent a year. Europe will grow annually 3.9 percent, and in terms of revenue per passenger mile, ranks as the third largest regional market with 25 percent of the world total.

ITT Corp is expected to battle an unsolicited bid from Hilton Hotels Corp with an arsenal of defenses that include its well-known franchise name, its "poison pill" anti-takeover plan and the promise of future earnings power.
Wall Street takeover experts said the 29 percent premium offered by Hilton in its $6.5 billion offer for ITT is not enough to win the company.
"The franchise value alone is worth more than what they're offering," said one trader who did not want to be identified.  
Hilton earlier announced the cash and stock offer for ITT and kept open the possibility of a higher offer if it is permitted to look at ITT's financial data.
ITT could not be reached for comment.
Owner of properties such as Madison Square Garden, Caesar's World and the New York Knicks professional basketball team, ITT's stock price has been hurt recently by gaming construction disruptions and competition. Shares of ITT, which were trading at about 65 in June, closed Monday at 42-5/8.
But traders expect the stock price to rebound as a $2.5 billion capital expenditure program starts to pay off.  
"It's a company with a potentially very high value. Right now, the deck is stacked in favor of the target," said Eric Longmire of Wyser-Pratte &amp; Co Inc.
ITT is gambling much of its future on the $2.5 billion capital spending program, which will expand and update its casino operations. It opened the Las Vegas Desert Inn resort last month after a $160 million renovation.
In December, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded its outlook on the company to negative from stable, saying that the capital spending plan would result in higher debt.  
"Since the break-up, they've been on an expansion binge. The excitement of the break-up is over and now the company has to perform," said the takeover trader.
Last week, chief operating offer Robert Bowman told Reuters in an interview that ITT may pursue hotel acquisitions this year. The company reportedly last year sought to buy Bally Entertainment Corp, but the hotel company eventually was sold to Hilton for $3 billion.
It also is expected this year to sell its $550 million stake in French telecommunications firm Alcatel Alsthom.
ITT was part of a huge conglomerate until 1995, when it spun off its manufacturing operations as ITT Industries and its insurance division as ITT Hartford Group Inc.
ITT Corp chief executive officer Rand Araskog has run the company since 1979 and took over as top executive of the entertainment and gaming company after the spin-off.

ITT Corp. on Wednesday rejected Hilton Hotels Corp.'s unsolicited $6.5 billion takeover offer and said it would consider a plan to sell non-core assets in an attempt to boost shareholder value.
New York-based ITT said the potential sale of the properties -- which could include its 50 percent stake in the famed Madison Square Garden arena and the New York Rangers hockey and New York Knicks basketball teams based there -- would be put into effect in order to focus on its Sheraton hotel and Caesars casino businesses.
Wall Street sources immediately estimated ITT could generate some $3 billion from asset sales and use the proceeds to buy back stock or issue a special dividend to investors.
They also warned the plan might not be effective enough to pacify ITT shareholders who have seen the company's stock price eroded in recent months.
"The issue is creating shareholder value, both short- and long-term," ITT Chairman Rand Araskog said in a news release. "We plan to deploy our financial resources only to those assets that produce superior current and future earnings growth."
ITT said Hilton's offer of $55 per share did not reflect the inherent value of ITT, which owns and operates Sheraton hotels and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas, Reno, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J.
ITT also said keeping the company independent would be in the best interests of its shareholders and other constituents, and that it would seek various options to increase the company's value.
In rejecting Hilton's offer, ITT also cited potential antitrust implications. It said there were "serious business conflicts which have always confronted a (potential) Sheraton/Hilton combination," adding that owning and managing multiple hotels under each brand in dozens of the same cities would create material conflicts of interest.
The ITT rejection came one day after Hilton announced plans to take control of ITT by ousting its board of directors. It proposed 11 candidates for ITT's current board seats, and named 14 others who could be added if ITT attempts to thwart Hilton's bid by boosting the number of board members.
Hilton said its plans would not be altered by ITT's rebuff, adding its $55 bid was a solid offer.
Wall Street analysts widely expect Hilton to raise its bid, perhaps by as much as $10 per share.
"If Hilton comes back with $65, I think ITT will have trouble making a strong case to its shareholders," said Bruce Raabe of brokerage Collins &amp; Co.
An ITT spokesman said the company had no comment on what it might do if Hilton sweetened its offer. "We will see what happens," he said.
Meanwhile, it appeared ITT was already moving forward with plans to sell some assets.
French telecommunications company Alcatel Alsthom said it has been approached by ITT for permission to sell some of its 5 percent stake before an agreed-on July deadline. ITT signed a shareholders agreement with Alcatel in 1992 that called for it to retain the stake until July 3.
An Alcatel spokesman declined to comment further, and an ITT spokesman could not be reached for comment on the issue.
Cablevision Systems Corp., which owns the other half of Madison Square Garden and has the first right to buy ITT's stake, declined to comment on speculation about a transaction. However, the company noted it previously has said it has an excellent relationship with ITT and Arkasog.
The Madison Square Garden properties include the New York Knicks professional basketball team, the New York Rangers professional hockey team, and other properties.
"It begs the question: why didn't they do it sooner?" said Daniel Davila of brokerage Rodman &amp; Redshaw Inc. of the potential non-core asset sales.
As part of its response to Hilton's offer, ITT also said it was filing counterclaims to litigation Hilton filed against it in a federal court in Nevada.
ITT said it was seeking to block the offer and seeking other relief because of Hilton's "misappropriation and misuse of confidential ITT information, including information obtained in violation of a 1996 confidentiality agreement between ITT and Bally Entertainment, now part of Hilton."
Alternatively, ITT said, it was seeking to compel Hilton to disclose information about its offer required under federal securities laws.
Hilton said Wednesday it believed ITT's legal charges were "without merit."
ITT's stock rose $1.625 to $57.625 on the New York Stock Exchange while Hilton shares slipped 50 cents to $27.625, also on the NYSE.

Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc will soon own Chef Boyardee, Polaner fruit spreads and PAM cooking spray, but the leveraged buy-out firm still has a big appetite for food companies.
The Dallas-based group, which announced on Friday a $1.3 billion acquisition of American Home Products Corp's food unit, plans to buy two Mexican food firms this year and does not intend to stop there, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hicks told Reuters in a telephone interview.  
"Our plan is to use this as a platform," he said of the American Home Products deal, the biggest ever for Hicks Muse. "We intend to start with this and grow both internally and through additional acquisitions of branded products."
Seven-year-old Hicks Muse has been digesting food businesses for several years. It bought dairy firm Morningstar Group in 1991 and took the company public in 1992.
In March it bought Ghirardelli Chocolate Co from Boston buy-out specialist Thomas Lee.
It also owns Campfire marshmallows and Angela Marie's.  
"We like established brands because we think they offer the most ability of cash flow and long-term growth potential," Hicks said.
He said his firm had been searching for a large food acquisition and was alerted to the American Home Products food business about six months ago. Most Wall Street analysts had expected the unit to be bought by another food company.
The devotion to the food industry by Hicks Muse comes as U.S. food companies undergo major cost-cutting and restructuring programs due to the maturation of key products and intense competition for supermarket shelf space.  
On Thursday Campbell Soup Co unveiled a plan to repurchase stock, cut jobs and expand overseas in an effort to boost profits in the mature industry. And Nabisco Holdings Corp announced in June that it would cut 4,200 jobs as part of a cost-cutting program.
Hicks said the buy-out firm will finalize plans to integrate American Home Products's food business by the time the deal closes in 60 to 90 days.
"We have a vision of what we are going to do," Hicks said, but declined to be specific.  
One of Hicks's savviest investments was in the 1980s when he and fellow Dallas investor Robert Haas built a beverage powerhouse through acquisitions of soda brands A&amp;W, Seven-Up, Dr. Pepper and Squirt.
But the Hicks Muse group ran into trouble with its 1994 $390 million purchase of G. Heileman Brewing Co, maker of Lone Star beer and other brands. In July it sold the brewer to Stroh Brewery Co for an estimated $275-$300 million.
Other Hicks Muse investments include radio stations and a foam company.

Norfolk Southern Corp was preparing Monday to buy nearly 10 percent of Conrail Inc. in a move that would further cement a stalemate in the three-month-old fight for control of the railroad giant.
The steps were taking place as Conrail and CSX Corp. assessed their strategy following Friday's shareholder defeat of a key measure in their proposed $9.4 billion merger.
"We've entered a stage where no one has ever been before. We're sailing in uncharted waters," said one source close to Conrail and CSX who did not want to be identified.  
Spurned bidder Norfolk Southern last week promised to acquire 9.9 percent of Conrail for $115 a share if the railroad's stockholders defeated the provision that would have allowed the Conrail-CSX transaction to proceed. Preliminary results showed that about 53 percent of Conrail's outstanding shares were voted against the measure.
The 9.9 percent investment is the maximum amount of Conrail stock that Norfolk Southern can purchase without triggering Conrail's poison pill anti-takeover defense.
"We will move without delay on our tender offer," said Norfolk Southern spokesman Robert Fort.  
The formal process was not expected to begin until later in the week when Conrail released final vote results.
Once it buys the stake, both Norfolk Southern and CSX will hold sizable investments in Conrail without any imminent opportunity to buy the rest of the company.
CSX, which bought 19.9 percent of Conrail in November as part of the planned friendly deal, needs to win approval of Conrail shareholders to proceed with the cash and stock transaction. Many shareholders favor Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion cash offer, which has been rejected by Conrail.  
Under its pact with CSX, Conrail is prohibited from merging with another company until 1999.
"Right now, it's a standoff," said one Wall Street trader.
Conrail has vowed to convince shareholders that the proposed transaction with CSX is a better fit than the Norfolk Southern offer and plans to schedule another shareholder vote. No meeting date has been set yet.
"The next step in the strategy hasn't been determined. I don't think that there's any rush. We're not going anywhere," said a source close to the situation.  
But Conrail apparently plans to keep a low profile for the next few days. Sources said the railroad has cancelled a traditional meeting with analysts to discuss fourth quarter earnings, due to be released Wednesday.
Meanwhile, speculation abounds about the eventual outcome of the three-way battle. Wall Street analysts and traders have theorized that CSX may be forced to sweeten its offer for Conrail, despite repeated statements from CSX that no higher bid is forthcoming.
And other experts speculate Conrail's board may pursue a three-way deal among the railroads at some point, especially if Conrail's stock price erodes from current levels of about $103 per share.

The top executives of Conrail Inc., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. met Friday in a critical session aimed at resolving a stalemate in the three-month takeover battle for Philadelphia-based Conrail.
The three companies declined to comment on the session, but hinted that future meetings could be forthcoming.
"Conrail, CSX and Norfolk Southern have concluded their meeting and have agreed that no further details on this meeting or timing of future meetings will be announced," the railroads said in a joint statement.
The long-awaited meeting between chief executives David LeVan of Conrail, John Snow of CSX and David Goode of Norfolk Southern is viewed as critical to railroad consolidation on the East Coast.
Conrail has rejected a $10.3 billion cash offer from Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern in favour of a $9.6 billion cash and stock transaction with Richmond, Va.-based CSX.
The deal ran into trouble earlier this month when Conrail shareholders defeated a key provision that would have permitted the planned merger with CSX to move forward. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern is now in the process of buying 9.9 percent of Conrail's stock.
The three executives agreed last week to hold a meeting to discuss competitive issues in the railroad industry. Conrail and CSX have stressed they are committed to their transaction and Norfolk Southern has said it would not accept any resolution that would value Conrail at less than its $115 per share offer.
Wall Street analysts expressed cautious optimism about the meeting, but warned that any end to the stalemate would be difficult and lengthy. On Wednesday, Goode also said that negotiations would likely be tough.
"We would suggest it is the first of many meetings, but it's a step in the right direction," said Thomas Galvin of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, noting that East Coast railroad consolidation has been discussed for the past 10 years.
Separately, the head of the federal agency that oversees railroads, reiterated her support of private sector negotiations to resolve competitive access issues in railroad mergers.
"What history has shown us is that private sector negotiations do result in the benefit to the parties involved and the public at large," said Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, in a speech at the National Mining Association's annual transportation conference being held in Florida.
Although Morgan did not address the Conrail case specifically, she said the board would look to preserve competition in the nation's rail network.
Shares of Conrail dipped 12.5 cents to $107.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock also fell 12.5 cents to $48.50 and Norfolk Southern shares fell 50 cents to $88.625, also on NYSE.

ITT Corp expects the sale of its non-core assets to take up to six months, although the Madison Square Garden properties are likely to be sold more quickly, according to sources close to the company.
The hotel, casino and entertainment company has held high-level talks with Cablevision Systems Corp about acquiring its 50 percent stake in Madison Square Garden, but no deal has been struck, the sources said.
Cablevision is "the primary potential acquirer," said one source close to ITT who declined to be identified.  
Although ITT has held discussions with potential buyers about the other properties, which include its profitable international telephone directories business, those talks are not in advanced stages, the sources said.
Sources also said on Thursday that ITT has hired Morgan Stanley to assist with the asset sales. ITT also is being advised by Lazard Freres and Chase Securities.
ITT declined to comment on the potential sales or the hiring of Morgan Stanely. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman also declined to comment.  
ITT rejected a $6.5 billion hostile takeover bid from Hilton Hotels Corp on Wednesday and said it would consider selling non-core assets to boost shareholder value.
ITT partnered with Cablevision in 1995 to buy the Madison Square Garden properties, which include the world-famous arena, the New York Knicks professional basketball team and the New York Rangers professional hockey team.
Cablevision declined to comment again today, referring to a Wednesday statement in which it said it does not comment on rumored deals and also noted it has a good relationship with ITT.

A Conrail Inc. director abstained from a key vote on the railroad's proposed $9.1 billion merger with CSX Corp. due to a controversial provision prohibiting both parties from seeking another deal until 1999.
In a filing late Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Conrail disclosed that board member David Lewis abstained from the vote "in light of the provision... extending the exclusivity period to December 31, 1998."
Conrail did not disclose any other details, but noted that Lewis still fully supported the proposed transaction.
Lewis, a partner in Detroit law firm Lewis Clay &amp; Munday, could not be reached for comment.
CSX and Conrail last week revised terms of their merger to give shareholders another $870 million in the transaction and establish a voting trust to accelerate payment to investors.
The exclusivity period, which was extended from July 1997, is one of the most controversial aspects of the proposed deal.
Rival bidder Norfolk Southern Corp. has challenged the exclusivity period in court, contending that Conrail's board has violated its duties and misled shareholders.
A hearing on the issue has been set for Jan. 9 in U.S. district court.
Takeover stock traders speculated that Norfolk Southern would seek testimony from Lewis at the hearing about the reasons for his abstention.
CSX and Norfolk Southern have been locked in a two-month bidding war for Conrail. Although Norfolk Southern's $10.5 billion offer is higher, Conrail has rejected its advances and contends that its planned $9.3 billion merger with CSX is a better fit.
A Conrail spokesman declined to comment on Lewis' abstention. Conrail's other 11 board members reportedly voted in favour of the revised cash and stock CSX deal.
Shares of Conrail gained 12.5 cents to $100 on the New York Stock Exchange. CSX stock fell 25 cents to $43 and Norfolk Southern shares fell $1.125 to $88.375, also on the NYSE.
Legal experts last week noted that Pennsylvania corporate law grants broad discretion to corporate boards when they are considering a transaction.
In addition to the legal battle, industry sources widely anticipate any proposed transaction with Conrail will generate opposition at the regulatory level from the losing bidder, shippers and state agencies.

Oil giant Texaco Inc. said Tuesday it would complete its exit from the chemicals business by selling a Texas facility to privately-held Huntsman Corp. for about $600 million.
White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco, which sold the bulk of its chemicals business to Huntsman in 1994 for more than $1 billion, said the sale will allow it to concentrate on its core oil and natural gas businesses.
Salt Lake City, Utah-based Huntsman is the nation's largest privately-held chemicals company.
Huntsman has operated the Texaco propylene oxide/methyl tertiary butyl ether (PO/MTBE) plant at Port Neches, Texas since 1994 and owns an adjacent facility. The plant has a production capacity of about 400 million pounds per year of propylene oxide and about 15,000 barrels per day of MTBE, a gasoline additive.
Propylene oxide is a petrochemical used in home furnishings, construction, appliance, packaging and transportation. Huntsman consumes propylene oxide for the production of specialty chemicals.
Huntsman also said it has entered a long-term agreement with BASF AG under which BASF will receive a significant portion of the Port Neches propylene oxide production.
MTBE is a key gasoline additive used in the production of cleaner-burning blends. Texaco and Huntsman said they have have negotiated a long-term MTBE supply agreement.
As part of the agreement, Huntsman also will acquire Texaco's PO/MTBE manufacturing technology, including the right to license the technology around the world.
"This acquisition will greatly enhance our product integration and diversification by allowing us to add propylene oxide to our list of core products. It also will make us the nation's second-largest producer of MTBE, with capacity of more than 27,000 barrels per day," Jon Huntsman, chairman of the family-owned business, said in a statement.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1997.
Huntsman's 1994 transaction with Texaco included a right to buy the Port Neches facility, but that option expired in April without an agreement between the two companies.
"While we have always had an abiding interest in the PO/MTBE facility, we were consumed with some other projects at the time," Jon Huntsman Jr., vice chairman and eldest son of the chairman, said in a telephone interview.
A Texaco spokesman said other potential buyers had expressed interest in the facility.
Huntsman said the purchase of the propylene oxide facility will fit well with its existing propylene production. The company makes more than 1 billion pounds per year of propylene.
"PO is a pretty robust market in terms of growth," he said, noting that growth is projected at more than 5 percent per year.
Huntsman also said he was optimistic about the growth potential for MTBE despite some market concerns that European demand may fall short of expectations. Global production of MTBE has exploded in the past five years due to environmental mandates for cleaner-burning fuels.
"We're believers in the future of MTBE. (The growth rate) is not at the 7, 8 or 9 percent that people were talking about earlier, but I think that was a bit overblown," he said, adding that more realistic projections call for MTBE to grow at a rate of 4 to 5 percent.

Western Resources Inc, which has spent much of 1996 laying the groundwork to buy ADT Ltd, is widely expected to sweeten its unsolicited $3.5 billion offer for the electronic security giant.
Industry experts said the bid, which values ADT at 22-1/2 per share, is deliberately low and merely reflects an opening salvo in a hostile transaction.
"The price is a low-ball price. There is a very good chance this deal will be done at a higher price," said Andrew Jeffrey, analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
Long considered one of the premier properties in the highly-fragmented electronic security industry, most industry analysts value ADT at significantly more than the Western Resources offer announced earlier Wednesday.
"I feel this stock will go to 25 to 30 on earnings in 1997. Anything below that range is not acceptable," said Rosario Ilacqua of Rothschild Inc.
Furthermore, ADT's proposed acquisition by Republic Industries Inc, which collapsed in September, valued the company at about 29 per share. That deal fell apart due uncertainty from Republic's volatile stock price.
Shares of ADT jumped 2-3/4 to 22-7/8 on Wednesday.
In a telephone interview, Western president Dave Wittig declined to discuss a potential higher bid, noting only that shares of ADT have appreciated considerably in recent months.
"I think that what we're putting on the table is a fair and full price," Wittig said.
Western Resources has long been considered a potential buyer of ADT, but the company was not yet expected to pursue a transaction. Western holds a 27 percent stake in ADT and earlier this year opposed ADT's proposed transaction with Republic.
Wittig said Western Resources did not pursue an offer for ADT during the Republic deal because it was consumed with its hostile bid for Kansas City Power and Light. That transaction is still not resolved, but Western Resources is holding merger talks with the Kansas utility.
The proposed acquisition of ADT also holds problems for Western, which is taking its offer directly to shareholders in an attempt to install its own board of directors. ADT has a poison pill anti-takeover defense that would be triggered if Western bought more shares of ADT.
Wittig said he is hopeful that ADT's management will come to the bargaining table, but noted the company previously was not interested in a business transaction with Western. Wittig said Western executives last spoke with ADT in June.
Western Resources has actively expanded its role in the security business as it built its stake in ADT. It has signed six letters of intent to buy security companies this year, including Monday's proposed $368 million acquisition of the security division of Westinghouse Electric Corp.
And last week, Western Resources announced plans to divest its natural gas assets as part of a strategy to focus on its electricity and security businesses.
"They've got a lot on their plate, but as far as wanting to run the electronic security business, this is the way to do it," Jeffrey said.
The electronic security business has grown increasingly attractive to utilities and telecommunications companies in recent months as they prepare to enter new markets that previously were off-limits due to government regulation. The phone companies and utilities hope to add protection to their menu of services and expand their presence in homes and businesses.

Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc., a private investment firm, said Friday it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the food business of American Home Products Corp. for about $1.3 billion.
The business, which will be renamed American Home Food Products, sells packaged convenience foods primarily in the United States, with projected sales of about $1 billion in 1996.
Its products include Chef Boyardee prepared pasta products, pizza mixes, and dinner kits; PAM cooking spray, Franklin Crunch 'n Munch glazed popcorn; Polaner fruit spreads and spices; Gulden's mustard; Ranch Style Brand beans; Dennison's chili; Luck's beans; Ro-Tel tomato and chilies products; Jiffy Pop popcorn; Maypo and Wheatena hot cereals; and G. Washington broth. It also has strong foodservice and private label businesses.
American Home Products will receive about $1.2 billion in cash and will retain 20 percent of the common stock of its food unit, Hicks Muse said.
"Consistent with our proven approach of acquiring and building quality companies with exceptional management teams, this transaction provides a superb platform to execute a buy-and-build strategy in the branded food products business," said Michael Levitt, managing director of Hicks Muse.
The seven-year-old company, which has been gobbling up food businesses for several years, plans to buy two Mexican food firms this year, CEO Thomas Hicks said in a telephone interview.
"Our plan is to use this as a platform. We intend to start with this and grow both internally and through additional acquisitions of branded products," Hicks said of the Dallas-based firm's latest and largest transaction.
Hicks Muse bought dairy firm Morningstar Group in 1991 and took the company public in 1992. It also owns Campfire marshmallows and Angela Marie's. In March, it bought Ghirardelli Chocolate Co. from Boston buyout specialist Thomas Lee.
"We like established brands because we think they offer the most ability of cash flow and long-term growth potential," Hicks said.
An American Home spokesman said the company will use money from the sale to pay down debt and provide funds for "future strategic uses." The Madison, N.J.-based company had said in May that it was seeking buyers for the food unit.
"In general it's going to help them focus more on their pharmaceutical business and help them raise their gross margin," said Rodman &amp; Renshaw analyst Mario Corso.
"For (American Home) to sell a business that's probably growing at 2-5 percent over the next several years, they did very well," said Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Ian Sanderson.
American Home Products' stock rose $1.125 to $60.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in late trading.
Sanderson said the food business was a "laggard," with an estimated pretax profit margin of 11 percent. This compared with 18 percent to 22 percent for the rest of American Home's businesses, which include drugs such as Premarin hormone replacement therapy, medical devices, and consumer healthcare products including Advil pain reliever.
The company has said it has six new drugs it expects can generate over $500 million each in peak annual sales, including Rapamune for preventing organ rejection, a bone growth hormone factor and the Effexor line of anti-depressants.
"A year down the road maybe they'll have to reassess things, and if the pipeline projects haven't worked out, then they have to think about another big acquisition or something like that," Salomon Brothers analyst Robert Uhl said.
