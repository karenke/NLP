beck-s	    USA: RESEARCH ALERT - Enron price target raised.      01/12/2000   Reuters English News Service   (C) Reuters Limited 2000.    NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schroder & Co Inc said Wednesday it raised  Enron Corp's price target to $75 from $60 and cut  2000 earnings per share estimates.   - raised price target because "as the bandwidth trading market unfolds over  the next 12 months, we anticipate that an additional $15 of  value will be created for shareholders, with considerably greater value  possible as the market develops."   - cut 2000 estimates to $1.45 per share from $1.55 "due to fine-tuning."   - introduced 2001 EPS of $1.75.   - "Bandwidth trading will be a critical value creator in 2000. Enron has  built a critical base in the emerging bandwidth commodity  industry, which is poised to achieve rapid growth in 2000."   - "Bandwidth trading keys off Enron's market dominant skills developed in  trading electricity and natural gas. After executing the first  key bandwidth trade in 1999, Enron appears poised to begin posting rising  transaction volumes, establishing the credibility of this new  industry."   - "The ultimate value of bandwidth trading is likely to exceed the total  value of Enron's existing electricity and gas franchise."   ((-New York Newsdesk (212) 859-1700)). 
beck-s	 During the last few weeks, we experienced significant increases in Unify  transaction volumes because of Columbia Energy Services acquisition, EOL and  Calgary implementation.   For example, recently the Logistics transactions  increased by 91% while deal/meter count increased by 61% and total volume  (MMBTU) by 66%.  In addition, it is very possible that volumes may increase  by another 30% due to  new acquisitions in the near future. For these  reasons, we  must put our efforts in overhauling Unify Settlement  now before  working on London implementation.  Therefore, we are postponing our February  out visit to London.,  We will let you know our revised plans and targets as  soon as we can.  Thank you.

Based on the decisions we made at the meeting, we are ready to conduct a pilot February 8-10 of six modules from Wilson Learning Corporation. The purpose of the pilot is to evaluate Wilson Learning materials and facilitators and present a portion of the Leadership curriculum.  We will also pilot the communications module for non-supervisory employees.  We ask that you invite 1-2 managers from your group to participate and evaluate the modules.  Participants should plan to complete a minimum of two modules.  In addition, you are invited to participate in as many as you would like.  We are also opening this pilot to managers throughout ENA to  ensure  that the material adapts well  We are currently completing the curriculum  design  and plan to have information available in February.  As you may remember these are the decisions we reached at the meeting in December:  * Use Southwest Performance Group (SWP)and Wilson Learning products as our primary vendor and Achieve Global as a secondary. * Create an Enron faculty of outside facilitators that meet our specified requirements. * Ensure that the skills in our curriculum are matched to different levels of manager. * Ensure that we incorporate data available from consultants currently working with Energy Operations * Incorporate current Enron course offerings into ENA curriculum  Attached for your review are:  * Facilitator Profile * Curriculum Table - mapping skills to courses  Descriptions of each module are also attached for your review    The following are half-day sessions.  Supervisors may sign up for any or all  depending on their need.  It would be helpful if supervisors attend a minimum  of two modules.  We need to have a minimum of 9 participants for the course  to be effective.  As an added bonus, I will cover the cost of attending the  pilot.

beck-s	 We have pursued implementing Unify in London, however there are a number of  issues preventing that from happening in the near future:  The Unify IT team has a lot of competing priorities (including the Houston  SAP implementation, as well as Houston and Calgary changes and enahncements),  and are unable to commit to a firm implementation date at this time. New commitments by ENA (see mail at bottom) have further complicated the  priorities, so even the tentative plans for implementing Unify in London this  year are in doubt. On the IT side, there are a number of issues with support and scalability of  the current architecture of the system.  As it doesn't look like Unify can be implemented in London this year, we will  therefore change focus to streamlining the existing tactical solutions in  London (enhancing Back Office Settlements System, integrating with Global  CounterParties, removing London Office Manager, and using SAP where  appropriate).  Once Unify has been integrated with SAP in Houston we will in a better  position to consider the long-term strategic approach to Unify in London.    If anyone believes that we should take a different response, please respond  to this email.   Eric, Ian & Richard       	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

For example, recently the Logistics transactions  increased by 91% while deal/meter count increased by 61% and total volume  (MMBTU) by 66%.  In addition, it is very possible that volumes may increase  by another 30% due to  new acquisitions in the near future. For these  reasons, we  must put our efforts in overhauling Unify Settlement  now before  working on London implementation.  Therefore, we are postponing our February  out visit to London.,  We will let you know our revised plans and targets as  soon as we can.  Thank you. ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________      
beck-s	 Sally, As you know, we have been working to find new ways to improve Unify Logistics  functions.  A major step has now been achieved by installing TIBCO and moving  it into production today.     Utilizing TIBCO in conjunction with our other enhancements will enable  Logistics to obtain real time updates from both EOL and Sitara without having  to re-retrieve them from the database.  This will automatically update  Scheduler screens with new deals as it comes without action on their part and  also reduce required database access.  This has been achieved through great  team work between many groups including Logistics Schedulers, Unify IT  Logistics & ADE, UNIX and Network people.    Please let me know if you want  to know more details.   Thank you. 
beck-s	 From my review of Eugenio's consolidated VAR spreadsheet, the following  listed items are those that are open that we           need information from  you on.  I will send a separate email that will address ECM,PGE and affiliate  information.

If you will not be able to have  all of the information to Eugenio by Thursday night, please let me know.  We  may be able to give you some additional time to gather some of the smaller  pieces.   If you need to forward this on to others, please do so.  AA if you know of any other issues of completeness that I have not addressed,  please let Eugenio and I know!  *Why is Agg_ECT and Agg_ INDEX not available for January 1999? *Is Cuiba in ESA's Nos.  Is it gas or power?  What month was it first  included? Is that the trade month? *When did Australia first have substantial activity?  For some reason, the  spreadsheet has a June number, no July or August,      then September -  December.  If the first half of the year has material activity, we need to  get it from them. *Has the Merrill peaker transaction been calculated yet (it was not  originally in theDPR)?  We definitely have to have that for the Dec. number. *Where is EES gas?  Is it in the AGG_ECT?   *When did Kinneman's debt activity start?  The first VAR that we have is  September.  Did it start earlier? *Did ET&S first have financial hedges in May, that is the first number that  we have?  Who should I talk to there? *Is the June and September Rhythms number different that what we originally  calculated for the second and third quarter?  June must be as I recall it was  excluded at the time vs. the $24MM now showing.  Are the differences  primarily due to the 100%+ volatility versus the 60%+ number that Stinson  originally gave you? Have you asked him why he gave you what he did?  Please  get Jill Erwin to help you revise the December number for Ghost. *There is lots of missing numbers for Total Return Swaps.  Eugenio and Gail  Tholen to determine which swaps were in place in which months of 1999 and run  the appropriate models.  If different models will need to be used in  different periods of the year for the same swap, lets get that information  out to AA and Jan.

beck-s	 Congratulations!  For an unprecedented five years in a row, Enron has been  ranked the "Most Innovative Company in America" by Fortune magazine.  In  addition, for the first time, Enron has also been ranked #1 in "Quality of  Management," topping General Electric and Omnicom Group, and our "Employee  Talent" has been ranked #2, behind Goldman Sachs and ahead of Cisco  Systems.   America's most admired management team is paired with the best and  brightest employee talent.  That winning combination has led to Enron's  five-year "Most Innovative" sweep.  The "Most Admired" list will appear in  Fortune's Feb. 21 issue, available on newsstands Feb. 8.  You are the reason we have achieved such consistent recognition.  You bring  the innovative ideas to Enron and create new business opportunities.  You  contribute to our quality management team.  And you are the outstanding  employee talent that makes Enron such an exciting and successful company.  Keep up your outstanding work, and we look forward to even greater  achievements in 2000!  
beck-s	 Fernley, As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I  think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I  will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER  "prosecutable" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more  communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his  transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in  charge of the office.  Probably more to the point, it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team  that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that  he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from  Houston has to be part of the "World Tour"  in Europe (Brent Price), that  your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David  Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve  Young.  Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry  has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell,  and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I  just happen to be the most vocal. Ted     Fernley Dyson 02/08/2000 04:07 PM To: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Trading Support Operations - London  Rick,  Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support  function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we  already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.  The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more  permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry  understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we  would give him/her the job.   I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the  team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant  value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.  However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,  whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I  can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.  I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted  within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in  London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy  to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will  be monitoring the situation very closely.  Regards  Fernley.  
beck-s	 In order to align the Global Data Management responsibilities for Contracts  and Facilities with the overall Operations support for Brian Redmond's Asset  area, the Global Contracts and Global Facilities functions for Assets have  been transferred to Steve Venturatos within Brenda Herod's Gas Assets  Operations organization.   All contract and facility requests for the Enron  companies listed below should be directed to Steve.

Bridgeline Gas Distribution LLC  Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC   Global requests for Enron North America and Offsystem pipelines will continue  to be handled in my area by Connie Sutton.  Responsibility for Global  Counterparty setups and updates remains centralized in my organization headed  by Mary Gosnell.   If I have missed someone in the distribution, please forward. 
beck-s	 Ted,  We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on  specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and  prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and  the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has  changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality  risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary  recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard).   Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the  Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I  suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team -  his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his  considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult  to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to  address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this  issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any "prosecutable"  offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management  style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and  objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank)  with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a  different story to tell on Helsinki.  As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour',  although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks  back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy  to contribute staff to this too.

beck-s	 Just a reminder - timesheets need to be approved by 10:00 A.M. on Tuesday,  February 15.  This is necessary in order to meet the Payroll deadline of  exporting time to ETA (the Corporate payroll system), which is NOON on  Wednesday, February 16.  Any timesheets that are not approved by the 10:00  Tuesday deadline will automatically be approved by the Energy Operations  Timesheet Coordinator.  FYI - For the payroll period ending 1/31, there was only 1 timesheet  outstanding at the established deadline.  In the past, there have been as  many as 100 (which represents a little more than 25% of the Energy Operations  headcount).  Thanks for your help and support.  I know that the Assistants  all appreciate your help in meeting this deadline.  A lot of you may not be affected by Project Hurricane.  If you don't know  anything about it, then you probably aren't affected by it!  In any event, we  have set up 2 new E-work orders in the Org Database for Project Hurricane.   They are as follows:  E-HURR (should be used to capture all time spent on the ongoing support for  Project Hurricane) E-HSET (should be used to capture all set-up costs)  Both of these work orders are set up and can be used for the 2/15 pay  period.  However, the following steps must be taken for your employees to use  the ATES system and code their time to these work orders:  MANAGERS - Identify employees within your RC that will need to charge time to  either or both of these work orders.  Please let your Assistants know who  these employees are. ASSISTANTS - Based on the information you receive from your managers, you  must add 1 or both of the work orders to each employee's profile in the Org  Database so that they are able to charge time to the work order in ATES. ASSISTANTS - For each Time Site you are responsible for, you must be sure to  add this information to ETA.  If you aren't sure how to handle this, please  contact Kim Perkins ASAP at x3-5304.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation in getting timesheets processed in  a timely manner.  Please be sure to share this information with your staff if  you haven't already done so.  If you have any questions on the timesheets or  the work orders, please contact me at x3-6343.  Lisa Cousino

Please be as specific as possible to ensure we are capturing all  the skills needed to accurately price the job.  If you have filled out the  questionnaire in the past, you may want to update the information.  I will be  happy to address any questions you have regarding the form. 
beck-s	 Please join me in congratulating Paul Quilkey in his new role as Vice  President leading our efforts in Australia.  Joe Hirl has assumed a leading  role in the formation of our business in Japan.  Joe also has regional  responsibility for trading activity.  Paul's appointment is in recognition of the critical role Paul has played in  Enron Australia's successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he  has accumulated to date in his career with Enron. It is worth noting that  Paul joined Enron as recently as the Associate intake of 1995.  In the short  time since then Paul has developed and grown through various positions to his  current Trading and Origination role, a position of great responsibility in a  dynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the Australian market,  and far from Enron's traditional US markets.   Please join me in congratulating Paul on his appointment.   Rebecca 
beck-s	 In response to some questions you had regarding cost to pursue the Global  Intelligence project, the project team has put together a ball park costing.   To let you know where we are and how things are proceeding, I have also put  together a high level status summary.  Please review and let me know if you  have any questions.  As mentioned in the document, we are proceeding with  project development until directed otherwise.

beck-s	 In order to provide the appropriate degree of coordination and feedback, we  will begin to have weekly conference calls regarding progress towards putting  in place Enron Japan.  These will commence this week and run each week until  further notice.  If you are unable to attend please send a representative.   The call will be conducted as below:  Houston Thursday 4pm London  Thursday 10pm Tokyo  Friday  7am Sydney  Friday  9am  A call in number will be provided later this week as well as a meeting room  for those in Houston.  I have also added a summary sheet that I would ask all  to fill out and send in the day before the meeting.  By sticking to this  general summary form (1 page), we will be handle to keep the calls brief and  to the point.  I would not expect the calls to last more than 1 hour.  regards,  Joe 
beck-s	 You may recall that we met at a JP Morgan luncheon a few years back.  Because of the unsuccessful attempt by Morgan to sell the energy business, I find myself looking for employment.

beck-s	 In order to ensure that all computer-related equipment is being properly  capitalized and not expensed in your RC, I would like to centralize the  purchase of equipment for Energy Operations.  Going forward, if you need to  purchase equipment for a new employee or need to upgrade your existing PC  and/or monitor, please send me an E-mail containing the following information:  Employee Name (indicate if the employee is new) Location Phone Extension Equipment you would like to purchase Existing system number if upgrading your PC  I have set up an RC exclusively to capture purchases of computer-related  equipment.  This will make it easier to properly capitalize these assets.  One more thing I need for each of you to do.  Please review your RC reports  for January 2000 and make sure that there aren't any PC purchases charged to  your RC.  You can find them in Cost Category 601 "Non-Capitalized Hardware  and Software".  If you had any charges in this category for equipment, please  forward a copy of your RC report to me as soon as possible so that I can work  with Brian Heinrich to have the charges reversed from your RC in February.  If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 3-6343.  Thank you in  advance for your help to ensure that your RC does not go over budget for  purchases of equipment that should be properly capitalized.  Lisa Cousino x3-6343 
beck-s	 Dear Friends and Colleagues,  I wanted to give you the courtesy of hearing directly from me that I  submitted my resignation earlier today.    With a bright and busy 10-month at  home and another along the way, I am finding it difficult to manage my  priorities and balance my time with ever-increasing job responsibilities.  I  know that I will not work when I have the second child and want to make the  most complete and successful transition as possible for both myself and  Enron.    I have yet to discuss with Sally my departure date, but have left it open for  discussion since I have no urgent deadline to meet.   I know that I owe the  Southern Cone some more process flows, which I fully intend to deliver.     I have greatly enjoyed the past four years at Enron, and will miss many  aspects of my job and the company.   If you have any specific requests prior  to my departure, or recommendation regarding length of notice, I would  appreciate hearing from you.   Sue

beck-s	 Wanda -  FYI, Joe Hirl, the trader in charge of setting up the Tokyo trading office,  will be in Houston next week, and it would probably be a good idea if he  could interview Mark Frank, or whatever candidate we recommend for the  Controller position.   Our Controller for the Sydney office will be up the  following week and he should meet with her as well, as that will enable him  to get first hand knowledge of the remote trading office establishment issues  we've addressed in Australia.  Sally - did you decide on the one candidate you thought of when we met last?   We might want to arrange a meeting with him and Joe also.  Thanks,  Cassandra. 
beck-s	 Richard -  Attached is an outline of the involvement we've engaged AA to perform for  each business unit as they go-live onto SAP.  Please remember that ENA is  going live onto SAP's "common design" that has already been reviewed by AA  from a internal controls perspective.  So this attachment outlines those  items outside of "common design" that Wanda and Sally  probably want covered  from an ENA perspective.  As a rule of thumb, this proposed scope equates to  $100k - $150k in fees to AA that is over & above the audit budget.  One word of advice:  Designate a lead within ENA that has the time to stay on  top of the project, schedule meetings with AA, and coordinate their  involvement with the SAP team members, e.g. not Wanda or Sally, but at a  director/manager level at least.  I was the designee for Corp and ensured  that AA kept the project going.  Also, I worked extensively with the Janet  Tran, SAP lead director responsible for bringing Corp up.  Some big benefits: Kept AA out of SAP's hair when things got rough. Made sure that the SAP team knew what our goals & objectives were, especially  when we found something that needed fixed before go-live. Managed that in fact AA provided us a deliverable at the end of the project.  Please review and call if you need other info.  I'd be glad to assist ENA  too.  I assisted Europe (Naomi Connell) and Int'l cos (John Berggren).  They  appreciated having a "co-pilot" and we avoided duplication of effort with  what had already been done for the prior go-lives.  Also, they felt that  value was rec'd for dollars paid to AA for this work.  Terrie 
beck-s	 Here it is.  The block in the middle summarizes the change in business  situation over the last two years.  Stephen  ---------------------- Forwarded by Stephen P Schwarz/HOU/ECT on 02/23/2000  02:34 PM ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	From:  Stephen P Schwarz                           02/18/2000 04:17 PM 	  To: Bryce Baxter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lisa Csikos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rita  Wynne/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mechelle Stevens/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan Harrison/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Melissa K  Ratnala/HOU/ECT@ECT, Leslie Reeves@CCMAIL, Evelyn Aucoin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Laura E  Scott/CAL/ECT@ECT, Cheryl Dawes/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Melissa White/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dorothy Ricketts/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kimberly  Perkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Trang Le/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christy Sweeney/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Unify AR -- SAP Plans   	  Two years ago Enron North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash  application rather than SAP AR.  We decided at the time that SAP AR would be  kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the  business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that  Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.   I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.  Two Years Ago	Today Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in  place.	Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of  existence of signed agreement. Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.	Canada nets across  counterparties. Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain  separate net statement process.	ENA considering netting physical and financial  together. All account coordinators were to apply their own cash.	Cash applied centrally in  Power, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in  physical Gas. Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to  facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.	Cash is not being  applied meaningfully at the line item level.  The company has not made any  move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team. The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line  tool.	Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing  data, rather than using the on-line functionality. Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be  classified as "on account", with issues tracked in a case management system.	Case  management system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account  coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account. The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the  counterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.	Given the number of legal  entities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties  have, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash  seems easier. Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be "settled" with cash  movement.	Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be "settled" with cash  movement.  Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways: Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify  Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face  two problems in Unify.   Controls built into Unify are already obsolete. Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net  across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance)  impossible.  Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no  controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the  automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable  within SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at  the time of finaling a payment in Unify.  To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to  SAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.   Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this  decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any  additional time for consideration.  Stephen

beck-s	 Just wanted to catch you up on the events over the past week....and a couple  of things I want to talk to you about next week  REPORTING: It has been a continual challenge as you well know.  The good news is the  individual from EES (Chris Luttrell) accepted Jay's offer today and he is  going to start on March 3.   That said, I talked to Chris today and filled him in on where we are and what  we want to accomplish.  He feels our best option will be Oracle.   To ensure we are prepared for his arrival next Monday, we are preparing the  detail of what we are doing today, both our assumptions and all of the  various data sources for our current management reporting Also, Dave and I met with Wanda and Georgeanne on Tuesday regarding revenue.   I believe Dave sent you an update of this meeting.  We are meeting with  Georgeanne today to go over our assumptions, conversions, etc. to ensure that  we are consistent with those conversations in the annual report, and to  ensure that we are capturing all of the Enron data Customer database - we have been fine tuning this all week, and I think we  are about there.  There are still some minor differences, but we are working  to sort through these today (everyone is involved in the tie out).  I will  review the new report format with you on Monday and we will start sending  this out then. We also have an Access person that is working on improving our current  database since we will have to live with this in the short term.  TRADING ACTIVITY: It seems that we are seeing an increase in customers wanting to modify EOL  deals for various reasons (one being Web latency...they are claiming that the  deal did not show up on their transaction summary, so they thought it did not  go through, and they did another deal...and this first deal appeared sometime  later).  We have continued to emphasize the importance of not changing these  deals after they are completed, but despite this, it is still happening.  I  am going to try and track down Jeff Shankman this afternoon to discuss. We are also seeing more and more customers trading under the wrong  entities...for example, Aquila Risk Mgmt is executing physical deals, when  they should be only executing financial deals.  From my understanding, we  have "left the door open" for them to trade either way and are relying on  them to trade under the correct counterparty.  This is causing several  problems downstream..for instance, customers are wanting ENA to send modified  invoices with the name of the correct counterparty (despite the fact that  they were the ones transacting under the wrong entity).   We need to discuss  how leaving this door open affects our downstream processes.  OTHER: I talked to both Dave and Bob yesterday to ensure that we were in the loop on  new products, etc. to ensure that we are better prepared for the launch of  new products (e.g. Credit Derivatives).   Help desk news...Matt M. accepted a position with the Remedy development  team.  We are going to move Noel (he works nights) to the day shift to take  over Matt's role.  Donna assures me that he is very good.  Sandy Rivas also  wants to leave the group.  We should be able to handle the volume of calls  without replacing them.  I need to go over some call statistics with you next  week.  We have not received one phone call from a customer on the weekends,  and we receive less than .1 calls per hour between the hours of  7pm to  midnight.  I think we can get away with eliminating weekends, and using on  call pagers from 7 to midnight. One question - we currently are considering EES an external counterparty and  Enron Canada an internal counterparty.  We are now trading with Bridgeline  Gas Marketing (joint venture with Texaco - 40% ownership).  We need to  determine what we are considering internal vs external.   I would think these  would be external due to the fact that these are settled transactions...  any  thoughts?  I know this is a lot of info, but I also know you are going to be in high  demand on Monday!  I hope you are enjoying your ski trip!!!  Sheri 
beck-s	 Thank you for letting me read our Market Overview and Business Model for  Japan.  When I went to the Exotic Energy Derivatives conference in December, I met  Masayuki Fujita, who studies the Japanese power market for the Mitsubishi  Research Institute.  We chatted about deregulation of the industry and about  the entry of foreign companies into the market.  The Japanese understand the need to deregulate the industry, but want to  avoid the pain that may be associated with it.  This process is very  unfamiliar and uncomfortable for the Japanese.  They see power as a matter of  national security (like agriculture), so foreign entrants into the market  will have to tread with care, understanding, and sophistication.  Fujita is working on a report for the institute.  He has agreed to let me  have copies of the non-confidential portions when it is finished.  In the  interim, he sent me a copy of a presentation that I thought you might find  interesting.  Regards,    Eugenio 
beck-s	 I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago, and this topic got pushed  aside due to some other pressing issues.  However, each of you agreed that a  standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.    The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an  idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine  how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas  deals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would  automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals  that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember  that these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the  procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position  reports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk  run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions  each morning?     I would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please  re-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.  Sheri x36557  Mike - any potential problems with the DPR? Peggy - we discussed briefly a few weeks back...any thoughts?

beck-s	 Joe and Mike  Thank you both for your comments on the prior draft, I have attached the  revised reports for your review.   We would greatly appreciated receiving any comments by the end of the day on  Friday, March 3.  Regards Kate Agnew 
beck-s	 Beginning this week Houston participants can meet in the board room on 21  (3AC21C2).  Same numbers as last week...see below  Also, reminder to send your update to Hirl and copy me, please.

beck-s	 As you know, we have been experiencing very long processing times for Monthly  Accounting Closing each month.  This problem is becoming increasingly worse  each month because most of the prior months have un-finalized  invoices/payments which require reprocessing this data each month (draft,  reversal of last accrual and creating new accrual).   This condition goes  back to Jan. 99 for Unify, Jan. 95 for pre-Unify PMAs, and becomes worse each  month as more such items are accumulated.   A few month ago, we discussed this situation and as shown below, not much  progress has been made in finalizing prior month data in Gas business while  better  progress has been achieved in Power settlement.  It is essential this  be strongly addressed.  Otherwise, the system will soon be unable to process  the Monthly Closing (mass draft & Closing) within a day.  It will be very  helpful if you would prepare a plan to address this issue and attend a  meeting on  Thursday (3/9) at 10:00 in EB2601 to discuss future actions.   Thank you.     ---------------------- Forwarded by Inja Chun/HOU/ECT on 03/02/2000 01:20 PM  ---------------------------                             	 	Enron Technology 	 	From:  Regan M Smith                           03/02/2000 11:06 AM 	  To: Inja Chun/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Kenneth M Harmon/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: As discussed, below is the Mar-00 Accrual metrics, by delivery  period.   Inja,  Below is the revised detail items which reflect the open items from less than  July 99.  It compares from Jan1st metrics to March 1st metrics. The load to Unify comes from the 2 angels below.  The Mass Draft has the  concern of statements not finalized for those periods, which the back end  accrual & reporting has the increased load of line items.  Front End process  Mass Draft Process (load) - whenever any statement has not been finalized for  a prior delivery period, it has to redraft for those deals.  Hence, redraft  for every deal for that counterparty.  Back End processes Accrual Process - The accrual extracts on a line item detail, which is  stored, and reported on various reports. GL Month Process - The GL Month Report extracts on a line item detail, which  is reported from the ACRL and PDCLS perspective.  GAS Summary:       No of Line Items    No. of Line Items     July 99 & Prior Month    since July 99  As of Dec-99   12,848    87,574  As of Mar-00   10,802    123,694   Growth/Reduction  <2046>    36,120       ---------------------- Forwarded by Regan M Smith/HOU/ECT on 03/02/2000 08:30  AM ---------------------------   	Regan M Smith 	01/01/2000 02:08 PM 	 To: Inja Chun/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Kenneth M Harmon/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: As discussed, below is the Dec99 Accrual metrics, by delivery period.    Inja, As discussed, below is the Dec99 Accrual metrics, by delivery period.  Again, this increased history creates additional loads on: mass draft process - having to redraft prior delivery periods accrual process - increases the accrual time, reporting retrieval, reporting, sending to MSA J/P.  Example, we are nearing 10,000  line items alone of ACRL data for 016. period close reversal - each month we send a offset reversal for every prior  month accrual overall data growth in detail tables to support prior months      This can be also seen by running the accrual reprint retrieve report, or the  finalized transaction by gl month report (ACRL).

beck-s	 Thanks very much for your comments.  I too applaud the groups' efforts on the  new request system !  This is the kind of improvement in our processes that  we should all be seeking on a regular basis.  It's nice to know this one hit  the mark and adds value to our customers' processes as well.         Kim S Theriot                03/03/2000 09:55 AM  To: Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Bernice Rodriguez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Samuel Schott/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary G  Gosnell/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: New Global Counterparty Change Request System  Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know how pleased we are with the  New Global Counterparty Change Request system.  I had the opportunity to use  it yesterday.  It is very easy to use and very user friendly!  Also it is  very efficient, since we no longer have to remember who handles what party of  the alphabet.  We love the fact that we can work on a request and save it as  a draft before finalizing it.  Also like the ability to view our own request  so that we can view the status.  Overall, your group has done a great job on this project!  Kim Theriot  
beck-s	 EJ will be located on the 14th floor  Kamiyacho Mori Building, 14th Floor 4-3-20 Toranomon Minato-ku Tokyo 105-0001 Japan   81-(0)3-5404-3400 (this is the Regus phone line...we will have EJ phone  numbers by Monday) 
beck-s	 Thanks for a great lunch. I am, on reflection, very excited about the things  we discussed.  The Australian/Pacifice role would be a fantastic opportunity. Kinda - Comm  Supp Controller/CFO/CAO (whatever...) - basically Sally's & Rick's (C) eyes  whilst they're asleep (Tokyo support would report into Sydney - same time  zones). It would also have risk, control, processes & procedures  responsibilities - working directly with Ted's group. I'll work with them and  face the 'challenge' so to speak.  Basically - running accounting, risk & controls - and keeping the global risk  function (headed by yourself) with a flag waving 24 hours a day - kinda  CFO/CAO/Controller for Enron goes Global/24 hours.  The idea - 'Enronise' the junior offices - put an experienced person in there  to 'set the standards' and the tone of operations - and train the local  employess in the ECT way. Working closeIy with IT, RAC, Risk, Operations  etc...  I love the idea. And I think the timing (vis Helsinki etc..) is perfect.  I think it dovetails well with the current environment of putting the right -  experienced - people in the right places in the world to ensure that the  standards remain high - especially with EBS starting to spread into the  'world'.  Fernley was very supportive on the idea. I guess we would need to speak to  Commercial people.  I also, on the London subject, spoke to Brent. I think London would benefit  from Brent - he's a good guy. It would also allow me a shot at the new role  in say a 2/3 month roll-out - starting in the Summer.  Let's keep talking. Let me know how (if?) you want to progress things. Hope  Orlando was fun.  B.   
beck-s	 At the request of the Financial Council during its last meeting, the COE  established a SWAT team to assist the business units in SAP reporting.  This  is the first of weekly status reports that we will provide.  Purpose:    The team has begun to hold small, interactive workshops with production users  to:  Show users how to extract data from SAP by: Using on-line inquiry Using SAP standard reports and Creating and modifying a variant Educate users on the SAP data model and where business unit specific data  resides in SAP (which module). Better understand what additional reporting needs users may have.  Team structure: Lead:  Kim Lesley (consultant)    PS:  Andreas Kraus (COE), Damon Willis (consultant)    FI/CO:  Randy Parman (COE), Esther Cortes (consultant)    Education support:  Maria Young (COE)  The structure of the team reflects the initial focus on project and financial  reports.  It has been balanced to include COE support analysts who will  provide long-term customer support plus SAP consultants with deep reporting  knowledge.  We will adjust the team members as appropriate to address the  material needed by the business units.  In addition to this team, Susan Bellinghausen and Emitra Nelson are  continuing their efforts on 1/1, 4/1 and 7/1 report development.  Progress:  To date we have held 5 workshops with the Apachi and South American regions.   These workshops have been evaluated across several criteria.    On a scale of 1-4 (1 = not at all and 4 = absolutely), the workshops have  received an average rating of 3.6 in learning reports and increasing comfort  levels.  The workshops are definitely providing the one on one experience  that the users are requesting.  They are also seeing and learning (hands on)  various tools that are available to them to adjust the display of reports,  query the data from each module and analyze the data.  The sessions are also  helping to remove some of the fear associated with trying things in a new  system by providing helpful tricks and hints from the experts.    However, there is still a concern about increasing the understanding of where  data resides within SAP.  This is reflected in the average rating to the key  question "can SAP meet your needs" being only 2.5.  We will further explore  why the users think this is the case and what they are not getting.   We are  adjusting our sessions to address this and will continue to seek feedback.    Upcoming key activities:  Schedule the remaining International region sessions and the EECC home office  sessions.  We have the participant lists and are working on logistics. Complete the analysis of the needs of the other business units in production. Develop a process to follow up on these sessions to monitor the learning  progress of the users. Begin to evaluate a cost center reporting tool that Enron Europe has deployed  in London.   I would like to thank the active participation of the business units in  identifying and providing the right group of resources to the sessions.  If  you have any questions or comments, feel free to address them to Melissa  Becker, Kim Lesley or myself.  Greg 
beck-s	 The purpose of this message is to update a variety of interested parties on  the status of several "hot" topics.  I will be very brief, so please inquire  if you want to know more.  Also, please forward to anyone I may have left off  this distribution.  I can't remember everyone who attended the various  meetings last week.  Reporting Live Users - A number of workshops have been conducted and are scheduled to  be conducted to help users better understand how to get at information in  SAP.  APACHI and South America users have had workshops; CALME and EECC are  scheduled, and NEPCO/OEC are being planned.  Please contact me, Greg Nikkel  or Kim Lesley to find out more on status.  Also, any feedback you have for me  on the effectiveness of these workshops and suggested next steps will be  welcomed. 4/1 and 7/1 Go Lives - Susan Bellinghausen and Emitra Nelson and the  respective representatives from the Business Units are working to make the  next to go lives smoother with respect to reporting.  Again, any feedback you  could pass on to me, Kathy Kokas, or Susan regarding suggestions or concerns  is appreciated. Long Term Reporting Strategy - We are still looking to identify a lead person  to head up the long term reporting strategy.  This would involve  understanding any true reporting gaps, as well as the right processes and  tools for closing these gaps.  In addition, the right degree of "common" and  business unit specific reporting needs to be defined, and the degree to which  reporting solutions are function-specific or cross functional (e.g.,  financial, HR, procurement, projects).  Close/Consolidations Bob Butts and Jan Johnson have taken point to head up a group to review the  consolidation and close process to determine how/when we get the process  optimized.  Susan Bellinghausen has followed up with Bob to schedule the  requested demos of ECCS vs Hyperion functionality.  F/X I was requested to obtain resources to do a third party review of the overall  effectiveness of our foreign exchange transactions as they flow through  different modules.  I am meeting with Kimberley Scardino of Arthur Andersen  this week to outline the assignement, and have obtained a commitment from SAP  America to bring appropriate SAP expertise to the review.  We expect to  complete this review in approximately 3 weeks.  The outcome would be a report  on whether effective processes and controls are in place for f/x processing,  and suggestions for how we could more effectively use SAP's capabilities in  this area.  Customers - please let me know how we're doing.  Thanks!

beck-s	 Please note this is confidential at this point!  To document what we discussed by phone, I met with Sally Beck and Brent Price  today.  Fernley Dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill, but it may  be 3 to 6 months before the position is up and running.  To accomplish the  need in the meantime, Sally and Brent have agreed to share the duties as  follows:  Brent - April 1 to June 15 Sally - June 16 to August 15  They are traveling to the UK the week of 3/20 and would like to schedule some  time with you on either Monday afternoon or Wednesday.  Please let us know  what is good for you.  Issues:  Housing - They will each be bringing their families with them (Brent - spouse  and 2 small children - the baby will need a crib; Sally - husband and 3  children - ages 15, 11 and 2).  I understand that the houses which have been  vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone  arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them?  Immigration - Due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and  have made trips already, I feel it would be best to apply for work permits  versus using the visa waiver.  I have sent them the forms and requested that  Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his  sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK.  I have informed him that he  should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by April  1.  Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the  short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit.  Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and  benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent  in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report.  Per diem - We need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size.  Let me know of any other issues we need to address.  As always, I appreciate  your help.  Jane

beck-s	 Sally,   Thanks for calling last night.  I've spoken to Joe Gold (MD) and James New (my Power Director) and we will be  delighted to have Todd over for a month.  We need him here for Monday 20th March - for 4 weeks - thru 15th April. Full  Time.   I guess he should plan to fly over next weekend to be here for the Monday -  bright and early. The timing is crucial.  He would work jointly with Neil Tarling (Director) on the project - basically  - to seperate the Continental Power Book into 4/5 regional books - complete  with individual portfolio's, fully documented inter-book trades, currency  functionality and control gates. He will be working with Traders, Comm Supp &  IT.  I suggest Todd touches base with James - Project 'Lead' - to get some  backgroung information about the market.  I think the 'Sally will pay' line swung it with the Commercial folks......I  said we had a free option - we can always send him home....  Speak to you real soon.  B. 
beck-s	 Please note a change in the DPR effective as of the 7th.  The "Bandwidth  Trading" line under the Emerging Businesses category has been temporarily  removed from the consolidated DPR.

He  started in the early open access marketing company days as a gas accountant  so he has good physical knowledge of the pipes and he, I think, has gotten  good exposure over the last 5 years or so to the risk management side.

From:  Jane Allen                           08/03/2000 17:54 	  To: Tara Rozen/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kim  Melodick/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Transitional Assignments   	  Please note this is confidential at this point!  To document what we discussed by phone, I met with Sally Beck and Brent Price  today.  Fernley Dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill, but it may  be 3 to 6 months before the position is up and running.  To accomplish the  need in the meantime, Sally and Brent have agreed to share the duties as  follows:  Brent - April 1 to June 15 Sally - June 16 to August 15  They are traveling to the UK the week of 3/20 and would like to schedule some  time with you on either Monday afternoon or Wednesday.  Please let us know  what is good for you.  I have free time on the morning of the 20th. I will book out a room from  11-12am in HR. Please let me know if this is a problem.  Issues:  Housing - They will each be bringing their families with them (Brent - spouse  and 2 small children - the baby will need a crib; Sally - husband and 3  children - ages 15, 11 and 2).  I understand that the houses which have been  vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone  arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them? I think the best  way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very  difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of  accommodation. My assistant, Lisa, has put a call in to a service who can  help us find serviced accommodation in South Kensington/Chelsea area or in  Dolphin Square where we have people now who are very satisfied. Is there a  reason you are partial to South Kensington/Chelsea? What if we find  accommodation in another nice area of London within a short commute to the  office? When I have some options, I will let you know, probably on Monday.  Immigration - Due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and  have made trips already, I feel it would be best to apply for work permits  versus using the visa waiver.  I have sent them the forms and requested that  Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his  sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK.  I have informed him that he  should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by April  1. Brent's work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before  April 1st, but it is unlikely. The way it works for this is as follows: Brent  will receive the work permit from us and if he is here, he will have to leave  the UK and enter with the work permit for it to be validated. If his family  are in Houston, they will need to receive entry clearance in the US prior to  arriving in the UK. This takes approx 7 working days and they will require  either Brent's original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each  along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates. If Brent  decides to bring his family with him to London prior to receiving the work  permit, they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of  time and have a return ticket to back it up. Once the permit is received, the  family can either travel back to Houston and submit the entry clearance visas  there or they can all travel to Amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing  entry clearance without a problem. There is always a small element of risk in  going to Amsterdam, however, as do not have to issue the stamps there, they  just do it because they are nice! Work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks  from date of submission. We can discuss all of this on the 20th.  Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the  short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit. PAYE is  due after 60 days; however, if Brent and Sally are really only going to be  here for approx 75 days, I am not going to inform the Revenue that they are  here. If this extends beyond the set time, we can look at options but the  only responsiblility that Brent and Sally will have is to ensure they  complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back. Also, as we  would have to apply the treaty here, we need to ensure the salary costs stay  in Houston. Jane, have you discussed this point?   Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and  benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent  in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report. Agreed.  Per diem - We need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size.  Jane, please call me to discuss. I have left you a message, thanks  Let me know of any other issues we need to address.  As always, I appreciate  your help.    Jane   
beck-s	 Accomplishments: Conducted several workshops with EECC and the CALME region this week Scheduled workshops with NEPCO Have identified the needs to be addressed in the NEPCO workshops and are  arranging appropriate resources Met with the London COE to discuss their status in terms of reporting (we are  sharing data from workshops) Have made an initial offer to Corp HR cost center users to conduct workshops  for them Brought in some EY help to work with the business units to understand the  multiple environments, extraction and analysis tools being used by the  different business units  Upcoming: Additional workshops for EECC and ESA Identification of the Corp groups that would like to have these sessions made  available (and subjects they would like to cover) Will complete the "user" guides with screen prints to give out to all  participants (step by step instructions, tools, and tips) Finalize the NEPCO workshops (Mar 20-22) Produce a plan for upcoming workshops for ECCS and Design review   Summary analysis of evaluations from this week's workshops: Our overall belief is that the workshops, the one on one attention, the new  content etc. are being received very well (scores averages around 3.5 on a  scale of 1-4) The score for the question of whether SAP will meet the reporting needs is  still too low (average of 2.8).  We will continue to analyze the root cause  of this problem.   There is definitely an improvement in people understanding which modules  contain which data.  We believe that a hand-out we developed really helped  this and will continue to continue to emphasize this learning.  Comments received: Very good and useful Could have used this sooner Sessions are not long enough I love the workshop idea, its so much better than training classes  Feel free to contact me, Melissa or Kim with any questions or concerns.

beck-s	 Sally asked that I forward the detail of the "killed" EOL transactions to  both of you.  We have emphasized the importance of stressing to our customers  that a deal transacted via EnronOnline is a binding/legal transaction, but we  have continued to see a few of these deals occur.  In summary, we have had a  total of 33 killed transactions since inception, the majority of which have  been with Aquila (5), Koch (8), and internal trades (13).  Obviously, the  ones that concern us the most are those transactions with third parties, and  most of these have been due to claimed web latency and transactions not  appearing on the customer's summary report.  It is important to stress to the  Commercial team that the way to "get out of a trade" is to do an offsetting  trade or have our Legal Dept prepare a termination agreement.  Please feel  free to pass my name on to your respective groups as a point of contact to  work with Legal in the case of a terminated deal.      Feel free to call me with any questions (x36557).

These are situations in which an EnronOnline trade has been completed, but we  have agreed verbally with the other party that the trade will be deemed not  have happened and we may have suppressed generation of a faxed confirmation.  It is of great importance that we do not do anything which makes an  EnronOnline trade appear as though it is not firm, or not reliable, or which  affects the audit process.  Therefore, EnronOnline transactions must not be killed.   Individual traders might elect to conduct an OTC transaction which has the  effect of reversing the impact of an EnronOnline transaction - this activity  is outside the scope of EnronOnline.  Please note that there has never been an instance in which there has been a  system error on EnronOnline which caused a trade to take place which was not  initiated by the customer. All instances to date have involved some kind of  operator error, or failure to use the results of a Transaction Search to  verify completed deals.  Dave

beck-s	 The Aquila issue has been largely addressed: the killed deals have been  primarly due to one trader there-Par O'Kane, and I've spoken with him on  this. I think this will resolve the problem. The Kock issue seems to be a  hardware issue on their side, and I spoke with the head of IT/b to b there  and she assured me they are trying to resolve this issue.  I offered one of  our tech guys to visit their shop.  Jeff       	Enron North America Corp.

OXO tower was one that Brent was going to when he visited  last time (can't take a baby there so we opted for something more casual)   they have all types of European/Continental type food -- and a georgeous  rooftop view of the city  Another favorite of Mo, Frank and I is the Gaucho Grill which is sort of a  European version of Churrasco's -- they serve Argentinian steaks that are  just awesome with some good red wine -- but if you don't like steaks you are  out of luck here.  This one is close to the Le Meridian where you usually  stay -- no view, but interesting decor inside the restraunt  Any others you have heard of that would like to try out?

beck-s	 Joe -  I spoke w/Fernley Dyson,  CAO for EE and Barry's current boss, and he's  supportive of Barry's transfer to our region to lead the  accounting/commercial support efforts for your Tokyo office.  I also spoke  with Barry, and he's excited as well.  I think it's a done deal.   Scott/Michael - I told Barry one of you would contact him tomorrow to discuss  the next steps re: a more standard expat package (not the 6 month situation -  Causey approved a more standard longer term expat arrangement), and plans to  move his family to Tokyo.  The issue we need to work out is transition, and I asked Barry to discuss  that with you directly, Joe, and I told Fernley we'd obviously be flexible  but we'd like him sooner rather than later.  Barry indicated the guy that  Fernley just hired that Barry was going to be reporting to is going to start  towards the end of April.  So I bet they're going to want some overlap there,  which puts us into end of May before Barry could really move.  I think we  should be able to accomodate this somewhat longer transition period with  Heidi's help and with Carol from Houston if necessary, plus I told Barry we'd  want him to make at least a couple of trips over to Tokyo in the interim so  he can start getting involved even before he moves over there.  But it will  be important for us to understand what specifically you want Accounting to  accomplish by the end of May so Heidi and Carol can plan how to support those  efforts while not infringing on Heidi's responsibilities and demands in  Sydney.  Meanwhile, I've asked HR to contact Eugenio Perez, Sally's designee for the  temporary Risk position, to begin those discussions, and Sally said she could  address transition issues for him next week - she'll be in London  (Scott/Michael - you should probably give her a call in the London office  their Monday afternoon).  Perhaps we can get Eugenio over to Tokyo earlier  than Barry.   Regards, Cassandra.

beck-s	 Sally and Ted,  Brenda, Vlady and I met today to discuss Project Door Step for Mariner.   Since Mariner is an E&P company rather than a trading company (or so we  think), I believe our approach may be somewhat different from the other  trading reviews.  The review will likely focus on the company's risk  management policies and procedures which we  think relates mostly to hedging  oil and gas production.  Based on a review of the last Mariner 10-Q (Sept  99), it appears the company does a significant amount of hedging with  financial instruments extending out to 2002.  The company also has  significant ($14MM) of deferred losses related to hedging activities.  As discussed with Ted, we have preliminary planned to visit Mariner on Tues.  March 21.  As a starting point,  Vlady is pulling RAROC information related  to Mariner and Brenda is getting all Enron positions with Mariner.  Please  call if you have any questions.                      Thanks,           Jim 
beck-s	 I would love to hear your thoughts on this.  Based on my involvement with  Bridgeline, I am very comfortable in this discussion.  The costs of the  services is probably the weakest area as we do not have numbers yet on the  costs we have been capturing in the E-work orders for Bridgeline.  However, I  do feel we will have very accurate numbers to provide in the future.

beck-s	 Tara Rozen and I have reviewed the cost of living tables provided by our  outside vendor and determined the appropriate amount of daily per diem while  in London accompanied by family is $55.00/day.  You should expense this  through your expense reports for every day you are present in London and not  on full expenses paid by the Company.  Jane 
beck-s	 Hi Sally,  I need to be working on my newest project, for which we went to Hallettsville this week, and tomorrow is Garden club, and I am almost through as president.  I will not preside in April, as I have a conflict-new secretary in Colonial Dames and then all we have left in Garden Club will be our May luncheon. Being presdent has not been too bad, as all of the ladies are very helpful. My project is the completion of our papers for the recognition of our cemetery by the State Historic Commissson .    That is why we were in Hallettville.  Hope to get that done by Tuesday-there are many attachments necessary.  We stayed in a Bed and Breakfast, which was fair but not oustanding breakfast. I ran by to see Dot for a few minutes before we headed home.  Mary had spent Sunday night with us to go with us and we met our cousin from Missouri City also.  Enough of that, this will be a great quick way to communicate.  I am glad Cindy gave me your address.  Hope you have had a great week-end.  I will write more another time.  Love,  Mom (almost signed it Sue) 
beck-s	 Hi Cath  Can you do me a favour?  Sally is proposing Eugenio for the Risk Manager role  in the Japan office.  Joe Hirl has asked me to track down his most recent  performance reviews.  Can you get hold of copies asap and fax them to me (63  2 9229 2352)?  Thanks and regards  Phil

This curriculum was designed at the request of senior management to  provide new and future leaders the opportunity to prepare for such roles.   Feedback from the program administrators is that there has been a low  response rate.  This may be due to confusion about eligibility and cost.   Just to clarify - All of you are eligible to participate.  In fact, you are  strongly encouraged to participate.  Further, those individuals within your  groups that are leading efforts or are expected to step into such a role are  encouraged to participate.  Please keep in mind that individuals don't  currently have to be supervisors to attend the training; the idea is to  provide training for new situations encountered as leaders.  Generally  speaking, those at the specialist level and above should be considered for  these classes - just use your judgment.    Although there is a cost associated with these classes, it is minimal in  comparison to the returns that can be gained through participation.   Guidelines are available to help you target specific needs for yourself and  your staff.  Please contact the training department to obtain a curriculum  guide.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Susan  
beck-s	 Just want to give you a couple of updates.  The prototype of the Market Penetration window was shown to Jennifer Fraser  and Chris Gaskill yesterday.  The overall response was very positive.  Based  on this, IT will provide a firmer estimate for delivery of phase I by the end  of the week.  The cost for the D&B data has been reduced by $100K after additional  negotiations.  Pursuant to that, the agreement was signed last week.  The  requested data was received yesterday.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT on 03/21/2000  09:55 AM ---------------------------   Mary Solmonson 03/07/2000 05:50 PM To: Greg Whalley/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Global Entelligence Status  Just wanted to let you know a few updates:  1) We have a full IT team now ready to go.  We are going to prototype the  first window, Market Penetration.  The prototype will give us something with  sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on  functionality.   Hopefully, we will have something in 2 weeks.  2) The previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from  the prototype.  The estimates are $1.6M for phase I and $1.6M for remaining  phases.  3) Included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389K for the purchase of  customer prospect data from Dun & Bradstreet.  The $389K is an O&M expense  amount that was not included in the 2000 budget.  This amount combined with  other amounts ENA did budget for or will spend with D&B results in an overall  budget impact over the next 12 months of $278K.  I spoke with George Wasaff in Strategic Sourcing this morning at the request  of Philippe Bibi.  George has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from  D&B.  Either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate  better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with D&B.  This  could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready  to go for implementation.  I believe I can give George some time to try  something, but when it comes down to it, $389K isn't that much money.   Therefore, I suggest that if we don't have anything negotiated in the next  three weeks, we sign the current proposal from D&B and move forward.    D&B  is currently threatening (a negotiation tactic, I think) to pull their  development resources off of this project until they receive a signed  agreement.  In the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our  delivery of Global Entelligence, we can provide a letter of intent to keep  them moving or sign the proposal at that time.  Give me a call at 3-6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items.

At some point a prize will be awarded to  whoever can guess what the "Q" stands for...  Objective  Project "Q" has a twofold objective:  1) Implement the Co-ordination function for the London and Helsinki Global  Trading Support group - see attached for a definition of this function   2) Roll out the Products Inventory Management System ("PIMS") for the London  and Helsinki Global Trading Support groups.  Target Timescale  Completion of both objectives is currently planned for the end of May. David  and I have hastily put together a timeline which we will refine as a group at  a Kick-Off meeting scheduled for next Friday, by which time the project team  will be assembled in London - see attached .  To meet this tight timeframe, the scope of the project needs to be clearly  understood especially in relation to rolling out PIMS. Though over time 1)  functionality may be added to PIMS, 2) there will (hopefully) be a further  deployment in Houston and Singapore, 3) an interface to RightAngle may be  developed, 4) invoicing may be added etc... - for the purpose of this project  the scope of the PIMS application is limited to replacing MANIPS for the  Helsinki and London Operators (Petchems may or may not be included in this  phase). The actual PIMS specification will be finalised next week by Graham  and David (IT are currently mid-way through a full elaboration for the  system).  Project Team  Steering group will comprise me (also Sponsor), Graham and Becky.  Project Manager is Cindy (arriving from Houston on Tuesday).  IT lead for PIMS is David Rae (full time for duration of project), managed by  Iain Greig.  A Task Force comprising three contract accountants is being assembled and  will be in place by the middle of next week.  Other stakeholders/key participants in this project are Logistics in London  and Helsinki. The result of this project should be to leverage our existing  operators and improve controls by introducing a second tier support around  the Logistics function. However, for this to happen a significant  contribution will be required from all our Operators to ensure a successful  implementation within our timeframe.  Regards, Tim

beck-s	 THIS MESSAGE IS BEING SENT OUT ON BEHALF OF GREG NIKKEL AND KIM LESLEY   Below is a summary of our activities this past week  Accomplishments: Delivered workshops at NEPCO Gained agreement with NEPCO on status of showstopper reports Scheduled India' s workshops for next week Rolled out (to NEPCO) the user manuals developed   Upcoming: Complete gathering of data points and begin to layout longer term strategy  (Elaine and Kim) Develop additional workshops (design and data flow, consolidations and  intercompany) Develop and deliver second evaluation Roll out manuals to user group in Houston    Where are we at? We should be able to ask more specific questions in our follow up evaluation  to get better data on what specifically they don't like about the reporting  out of SAP but as a rule so far we have consistently heard the issue of  management quality reports, ability to pull data from across modules (ie. HR  and PS data) and I can't get the data the way I want to see it therefore I  don't understand what the data is telling me.   This last point will be helped by these workshops (ability to view the data  in mulitple ways) but only to the extent where people use the tools available  and spend a little time to work with the system.  The design sessions  (upcoming) should help address some of these questions aswell - one big  learning from this has been that the majority of users do not understand  their business unit design or the overall design and therefore can't figure  out what the system data is telling them.  This is being addressed in the 7/1  training plan and will also be addressed in the long term reporting strategy.  Thanks, again if you have any questions please contact Melissa, Greg or  myself.  Kim Lesley

I guess my 'must have' criteria would be 1) Detailed EnPower experience - in  both ops, dev'p and daily admin 2) Excellent/Superior ranking 3) Someone you  see as a future 'star' - as this will be (in my opinion) a great opportunity  for someone.  I certainly can think of a few names right off the bat (depending on the  'level' Joe will allow us) - both here and Houston - Edith (Director? - maybe  too senior), Paul D.Arcy/Rob Yeo (2 Sen Spec in London) etc....

beck-s	    Telecom Companies Mtg To Discuss Bandwidth Trading  By Michael Rieke      03/23/2000   Dow Jones Energy Service   (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A group of telecommunications companies is meeting  Thursday to open discussions  on industry standards for bandwidth trading.    Set up by CompTel, a Washington, D.C., trade association that represents the  competitive telecommunications  industry, the meeting will initiate discussion among companies that are or  probably will be active in a nascent  bandwidth trading market that could be worth billions or trillions of  dollars a year.   Bandwidth is the capacity to move data over telecommunications networks.    Russell Frisby Jr., president of CompTel, told Dow Jones Newswires that the  trade group's members asked it to  get involved in the discussion of bandwidth trading.    The fact that CompTel is involved in discussion on bandwidth trading shows  that people are taking the idea  seriously, said Steven Kamman, a telecommunications analyst with CIBC World  Markets.    "This year bandwidth trading will move from a theory to practice," he said.    Before that can happen, the industry needs to set ground rules for trading,  and that will be a major topic of  discussion at the meeting.    It comes as no surprise that Enron Corp. (ENE) will be at the meeting. For  nearly a year, the company has been  promoting the idea of setting up a liquid market for trading bandwidth under  standard terms and conditions.    Tom Gros, vice president of global bandwidth trading for Enron, has two  items he thinks should be at the top of  the meeting's agenda.    The first is establishing an industry organization to set the standard terms  and conditions for trading bandwidth as  a commodity. The second is setting a North American benchmark for trading.    The bandwidth trading organization, or BTO, should consist of companies  "with actual financial risk" in  bandwidth trading, Gros said. That means the group would consist mainly of  major telecommunications carriers,  the bandwidth producers.    But others also have financial risk in bandwidth, he said, including some  major Wall Street players and bandwidth  consumers.    Gros said some Wall Street players have already begun trading bandwidth, but  he wouldn't identify them. A  source with a Wall Street investment bank, who didn't want to be identified,  said Gros's claim was a stretch.    Banks with trading operations are consumers, using telecommunications  bandwidth to move stock market and  commodity trading data internationally among offices, he said. But they  aren't actively trading bandwidth as they  do established commodities.    Major consumers of bandwidth would include large Internet service providers,  or ISPs. Gros said they should  also be included in the BTO.    Before bandwidth can be quickly and easily traded domestically, the market  needs a North American benchmark  that sets technical specifications, Gros said.    In domestic crude oil trading, the benchmark is West Texas Intermediate,  which must meet standards for  American Petroleum Institute specific gravity and for sulfur content.    In the bandwidth market, standards would be set for quality-of-service  issues like errored seconds, severely  errored seconds and unavailable seconds, Gros said. Those standards would  cover corruption of data  transmitted over bandwidth as well as the availability of bandwidth.    Enron has suggested that the benchmark cover the route between New York and  Los Angeles, which ranks  among the routes with the most data traffic in North America.    Agreeing on standards will be the toughest job to accomplish at the meeting,  said Ken Epps, senior vice  president for strategic marketing for Williams Communications Group (WCG),  which will also be represented at  the meeting.    The technical standards for bandwidth trading can't be set so high that they  limit the number of companies that  will trade, Epps said. If the standards limit liquidity, the market won't  develop.    "Everybody needs to walk away feeling that it's a standard they can live  with, that they can build their business  around," Epps said.    That goal can be met - it's just a question of how long it will take, he  said. "I don't expect it will be settled at the  first meeting of the CompTel group, but it will be the kickoff."    Williams plans to keep those discussion going next month at its own "carrier  forum" to discuss bandwidth trading  standards, Epps said.    About a year ago, when Enron first proposed trading bandwidth as a  commodity, Williams officials were quoted  as being skeptical about the idea.    But last month, the company announced it would take a leading role in  developing a market for trading  bandwidth. The Williams carrier meeting shows that the company is now  serious about bandwidth trading.    Williams is inviting "the real players, the MCI WorldComs (WCOM), the Qwests  (Q), the AT&Ts (T)," Epps  said. "It's about people who have the assets and how we use these to  advantage the marketplace, how we build  a good powerful market model."    CompTel's Frisby, Enron's Gros and Williams's Epps wouldn't discuss which  other companies were attending the  meeting in Washington. But Dow Jones Newswires was able to obtain a list of  attendees.    Among the invitees are companies with experience trading energy commodities  - Dynegy Inc. (DYN); El Paso  Energy Corp. (EPG); Columbia Transmission Communications, a unit of Columbia  Energy Group (CG); and  Koch Industries, which has investments in energy and telecommunications.    A surprise on the list is MCI WorldCom. Some industry sources have said the  company opposes the idea of  bandwidth trading under standard terms and conditions.    An industry analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said MCI WorldCom's  participation in the meeting is  indicative of changing attitudes in the telecom carrier industry about  bandwidth trading.    Retail marketing groups within telecommunications carrier companies don't  like the idea of a liquid bandwidth  trading market, the analyst said.    Such a market could turn retail customers into wholesale customers. For  example, a retail customer like an ISP  could go to a liquid bandwidth market and buy at wholesale prices, he said.    Also on the attendee list are telecom carriers Teleglobe (TGO) and Global  Crossing Ltd. (GBLX); NTT  America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.;  and Progress Telecom, a unit  of the electric utility Florida Progress Corp. (FPC).    Also on the list is recent IPO Universal Access Inc. (UAXS), a company that  matches carriers that have excess  capacity with carriers that need extra capacity.    LighTrade, a start-up company setting up pooling points to allow bandwidth  trading, was also invited.    Commodity traders are represented by Sakura Dellscher, Amerex, Prebon  Yamane, AIG Telecom and the New  York Mercantile Exchange.    Two consulting companies, Andersen Consulting and PricewaterhouseCoopers,  were also invited.

John     Joseph P Hirl@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 03/04/2000 11:28 To: John Chismar@ECT, John Thomas@ENRON cc:    Subject: EOL for Japan  As you are probably aware, we are looking at a roll out time for bringing the  international commodities on EOL to Japan before the end of this month.  We  have planned for a public rollout between 10-12 May.  The mailout for this is  expected to be sent out the third week of April.  As all the products initially posted will be handled through the Singapore  books, we need to make sure everything is in line.  We will not be offering  any domestic products until probably third quarter.  Legal has been reviewing  the nature and form of the Japanese law and has found that in its current  form we should be able to roll out the system without too much difficulty.   We will be using standard international contract forms which you would expect  the cp's in Japan to be comfortable with.  In addition to your support for  the range of petroleum products, Sydney will also quote your USD prices in  Yen.  I spoke with Hickerson last week and they are making preparations for  this.  With Sydney only 1 hour ahead, this allows Shane to provide real time  support throughout the business day in Japan.  I would suggest that we have a call in the next day or so to further  discuss.  Would tomorrow at 2pm Sydney time work?  I believe that this is  noon your time?  If this doesn't work let me know so that we can adjust.  thanks,  Joe

beck-s	 Sally,  These are the DPR Delivery times for March.  A few items to note:  March 1 and 2 are normal delivery times due to our month-end process.

beck-s	 I have confirmed our risk review of Mariner with the CFO, Frank Pici, for  Thursday April 6 beginning at 9 a.m. and extending though the day.  As stated  in my prior Lotus notes on March 16, this review will focus on the finance  and marketing functions of Mariner rather than the upstream operations such  as exploration and production.  Attached is a org chart which was provided by  the company.  Please let me know if you have any comments.

beck-s	 Sally   I will be in Houston next week and was wondering if you could spare me some  time to talk about the back office for Australia. I am the CFO in Sydney and  am currently running the settlements work done down here and I would also  like to go over the results of the audit.   At the moment I have time available both on Wed and Thursday and would  appreciate it if we could meet up on either of those days if you are  available. (AC Romero in Cassandra Schultz's office is co-ordinating my  schedule). Carol Howes and I are meeting with Harry Bucalo on tuesday to look  at weather settlements issues so we can also address the related control  issues for this new product if that is convenient.   Thanks  Heidi

beck-s	 It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha= ve=20 a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad= =20 array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major= =20 catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. = =20 EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w= e=20 have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov= er=20 $25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.  We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very= =20 specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20 transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20 site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se= ll=20 at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi= cal=20 eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20 competitors that can provide this capability.  We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20 dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are= =20 correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro= n.  Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20 opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20 Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a= =20 broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately= =20 be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20 wholesale, retail and broadband services.  Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along= =20 with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20 Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20 services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support= =20 services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20 success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these= =20 new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan= t=20 functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban= d.  Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi= ke=20 McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20 Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20 Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20 Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20 North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20 Committee.  Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20 Works.  It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did = as=20 an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology= =20 Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20 development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.  EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now= =20 be a part of Enron Net Works.  The success of EnronOnLine enables us to=20 utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the= =20 following individuals are included in Enron Net Works along with their=20 current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Ja= y=20 Fitzgerald, New Markets Identification; Bruce Garner, Metals; and Greg Pipe= r,=20 Pulp and Paper.  Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational=20 design and will provide full details on this exciting new business=20 opportunity.

beck-s	 GBN Steering Committee Meeting, 09 April 2000  May 17th Speaker - no sponsor. We decided against having a cover charge and to use GBN funds. We felt a  cover might reduce attendance and wanted to keep the speaker series free for  attendees. A $10 cover wouldn't cover all of the expenses anyway and we felt  it would create a bad impression. Deed Vest of Rockwell International has  confirmed availability for the date. Carolyn is handling the set up.  September 20th Houston's Economy Panel Paul Murphy, Southwest Bank of Texas: confirmed with sponsorship Shirley Delibero, Metro: unconfirmed, should hear something this week Robert Duncan, Transwestern Real Estate: confirmed Harvey Bunce, UT Galveston Med Center: unconfirmed Technology: need someone. Roger, any interest at Compaq? Energy: need someone. Sally, any interest at Enron?  Moderator: UT Professor Michael Brandl, Ph.D.  I will be contacting the TBN and see if they would also like to attend. This  will be a GBN event, but we will invite the TBN.   June 25th Astros night v. San Francisco According to Chrissy, the plans include a ticket to the? game, dinner at  Zydeco's and a trolley ride from Zydeco's to the new Enron field. All this  for only $25/person! Chrissy, if you have the info, let's try to get it on  the May 17th event mailing.   Summer 2000 Family Event Several members have expressed interest in a family event. Chrissy and I are  looking into Theater Under The Stars (Miller Outdoor Theater). GBN will buy  soft drinks and attendees will bring their own picnic dinner.

beck-s	 Dear Sally, It was a pleasure to meet with you on Tuesday, April 4 at UT to discuss my qualifications for the Enron Scholarship.  It is a great honor to be nominated for an award that is regarded so highly here in the business school.  I believe as a nominee, and hopefully as a recipient, that I can uphold the values that are at the core of Enron's business. Again, thank you for the opportunity to share my ideas with you.  I look forward to hearing the outcome. Also, could you please pass along Gene's email address as well.  I am assuming it is similar to yours, but I just wanted to make sure.

beck-s	 Guys, currently we have two meetings a week between the business unit heads  to discuss deal flow and communicate issues and opportunties - the Monday  morning meeting and the Friday managing director meeting.  I would suggest  that we eliminate both these meetings.  I would propose that we replace them  with a single  Friday afternoon meeting from 2:30PM to 4:00PM. The business  unit heads identified above would be invited.  At this meeting, I would  expect less of a reporting focus and employ a more candid and detailed  discussion of opportunities, problems and issues between the "partners" in  this company.  It would include (i) a review of current DASH's, (ii) a more  detailed discussion around the opportunities identified on the "Hot Sheet",  (iii) a more candid discussion around the P&L and tactics required to meet  overall financial targets and (iv) provide a forum to provide input into and  communicate business strategies between the business units. In other words,  employ the goals of the Friday managing director meeting with all the  business unit leaders represented.  Given the religious holidays this week, there will be no meeting this  Friday.  I would suggest that we have a regular Monday morning meeting next  Monday and we will start this new forum a week from this Friday.  This  meeting would be held in 30C1 and Monterrey, Calgary and Portland should be  connected via video conference.  In order for this to work and be effective,   the business unit heads need to be available and participate actively in the  discussion.  If you have questions, comments or concerns do not hesitate to let me know.  Regards Delainey 
beck-s	 We will be meeting for dinner at Legends restaurant at 5:00pm with Ted  Jacobs, Tim Rasnic, and some of the students from the JC Penney Leadership and Energy Management program. Following the dinner, we will  proceed to the presentation at the Oklahoma Memorial Union in  the Scholars/ Associates room located on the third floor and the program will  start at 8:00pm. Jody Crook will introduce the presentation and  then Steve Venturatos who will talk about his career and how he has  transitioned from Land man to an Enron director. I will facilitate the  discussion  and pass the questions to the team. A social will follow the discussion and  last until approximately 10:00pm. I will have a rent car for the group and  take everyone  to and from the dinner, presentation, airport, etc. I will be  in the office all day today and until 11:00am tomorrow if anybody has any questions or concerns. Thank you for your help.       George Hope 
beck-s	 FYI.  Here it is.  I think this might do it.  It would at least set the stage  for any further discussion that might be necessary.

We decided at the time that SAP AR would be  kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the  business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that  Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.   I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.  Two Years Ago	Today Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in  place.	Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of  existence of signed agreement. Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.	Canada nets across  counterparties. Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain  separate net statement process.	ENA considering netting physical and financial  together. All account coordinators were to apply their own cash.	Cash applied centrally in  Power, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in  physical Gas. Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to  facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.	Although gas  settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this  functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by  financial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating  cost of funds by commercial team. The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line  tool.	Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing  data, rather than using the on-line functionality. Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be  classified as "on account", with issues tracked in a case management system.	Case  management system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account  coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account. The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the  counterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.	Given the number of legal  entities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties  have, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash  seems easier. Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be "settled" with cash  movement.	Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be "settled" with cash  movement.  Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways: Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify  Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face  two problems in Unify.   Controls built into Unify are already obsolete. Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net  across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance)  impossible.  Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no  controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the  automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable  within SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at  the time of finaling a payment in Unify.  To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to  SAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.   Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this  decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any  additional time for consideration.  Stephen

beck-s	 As a follow up to the meeting with AA on Friday, April 14, Richard and I  discussed with AA (Sorrells, Grutzmacher and Brown) how the monthly BRM  controller's meeting deliverables and database deliverables should be  prepared.  The proposal I think we should recommend to AA is the following:  Opening and closing meeting with front line managers and discussion of all  items, regardless of priority ratings (high, medium, low) Report generated to the Business Risk Managers at the monthly controller  meeting in the "Project Doorstep" style, incorporating existing controls and  observations/action steps to be taken on the critical issues (those with a  high rating) and identify responsible person(s) and target date Follow up matrix report relating to the specific project audited in the  manner consistent with the BRM database indicating priority ratings (the high  issues should match the issues reported in the monthly controller meetings) Eliminate the summary report that has typically be presented at the monthly  controller meetings  Once the "Project Doorstep" style report presented by  AA is received at the  monthly controller meeting, compliance will input the issues into the second  database to enable the reminder notifications to be sent to the person(s)  responsible for the action step.  In addition, a monthly progress report will  be generated from compliance to the Business Risk Managers to show the  critical (high) issues and implementation detail, if any.  It will be imperative that AA issue final reports on the projects immediately  after they have been completed and deliver the matrix  within two (2) weeks  after the monthly controller meetings to Compliance for inputting to the BRM  database.  If this information is not received within the two week time  period, compliance will notify the BRM's and AA of the deficiency.  It will also be necessary for you, the Business Risk Managers, to notify your  front line personnel that they will be receiving the email notifications on  action plans with specific target dates and with the expectation that the  responsible persons will be expected to respond to the email with the status  report of the issue.  If you are in agreement with this reporting plan, please indicate so in a  return email message to me and I will coordinate all responses and  communicate this to AA.  I feel that this process will provide the BRM's the  necessary information that you have indicated you want to hear in the  controller's meetings, including the candid discussions as well as provide  compliance with the necessary information to maintain the database so the  information is available for the corporate needs.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 31939. Thank  you for your attention.  Donna Lowry 
beck-s	 I have been at Enron for eight months and work under Sally Beck.  In December I attended the Exotic Energy Derivatives conference, where I met  Masayuki Fujita from the Mitsubishi Research Institute.  He is doing research  on the deregulation of the Japanese power market.  We had lunch together and  chatted for some time about his work (I worked in a Japanese company for 8  1/2 years and speak fluent Japanese, so we got along easily).  He was in Houston this week and came by to visit.  On Monday, we met with  Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson and later had dinner with them.  Sally  suggested that I introduce him to Alan Aronowitz and you.  Of course, you  were out of town, but we did meet with Alan who said you would probably want  to meet him back in Tokyo anyway.  Would you like for me to set something up?  Regards,    Eugenio

Excellence Through Communication Each Business Unit/Global Function provided an update on Action Plans and  feedback to the ETC survey.  At a glance, all of the Business Units/Global  Functions find value in the custom questions.  Also, mail lists for the  October 2000 survey need to be updated and the ease of accessing the survey  needs to be consistent across business units/global functions. Dick Amabile will summarize the update and forward it to all of the members  of the Task Force. In the June V&V meeting, we will link up with the ETC survey team to begin  discussions for the October 2000 survey.  Sub-Committe Updates P&D Please work with your business unit/global function to identify pilots.   Please contact Kirk McDaniel (x368251) or Dick Amabile (x33972) with ideas  for pilots. The team is currently working the Ad Agency on how to communicate the  benefits and use of this tool with employees.   The team is also considering changing the name from Participation & Dissent.  Communication Training Work continues to enroll vp's and above in the Executive Impact & Influence  course.  As of 4/19, 179 people (54%) have enrolled in the course with 150  (46%) people not currently enrolled. The On-line Basic Communication course is on schedule with plans to offer the  course to employees during the 2nd quarter of 2001.  Communication Tools Results of the email survey and best practice interviews were communicated to  the group.  Action items are currently being developed and implemented based  on the survey feedback.  Internal Communication Campaign The campaign will formally launch on May 8 with a voicemail from Ken Lay to  employees.  We're also working on a short video of Ken to post on IPTV on the  Intranet. Elevator monitors will be installed in the elevators over the next 6-8 weeks  with a target launch date of 6-18.  The monitors will display live video,  corporate announcements, and Vision and Values messaging along with other  employee communication.    Best Companies Initiative An analysis of Enron's 2000 survey results was presented. An employee letter from the Office of the Chairman was recommended to be  forwarded to those employees reaching career milestones (5, 10, 15, 20, 25   years of service).  Please forward any changes to that letter to Gina Taylor  by Friday, April 28.    Thanks again for a great meeting.    Gina               
beck-s	 Because of unique aspects of their language and culture, the Japanese  generally find it far easier to deal with each other than with foreingers.   In some Japanese, this unease can lead to some unappealing attitudes and  behaviors.  The Japanese maintain a very clear distinction between an individual's public  and private faces, so that it is rare to catch them expressing hostile views  of foreigners.  Nevertheless, every now and then, a politician's remarks will  land him in trouble.   You might find the enclosed article interesting.  By the way, Ishihara spent  two weeks denying that he had done anything wrong and only apologized in the  past couple of days.  Regards,    Eugenio         Ishihara acknowledges word was inappropriate                   Yomiuri Shimbun                  Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara late Wednesday acknowledged in a  statement                 that it was "inappropriate" for him to have used the word  "sangokujin" and                 said that he regrets having caused misunderstanding and  hurting foreigners in                 general by using the derogatory term in a recent speech.                   It was the first time that Ishihara had clearly admitted to  having hurt foreign                 residents by using the word, which has discriminatory  connotations.                 "Sangokujin" literally means "people from third countries."  Yet it was used                 after World War II as a derisory term for people from former  Japanese                 colonies, primarily Koreans, living in Japan.                   On April 9, he told members of the Ground Self-Defense Forces  in Tokyo                 at a ceremony, "Atrocious crimes have been committed  repeatedly by                 sangokujin and (other) foreigners who have illegally entered  Japan. It is to                 be expected that they will riot in the event of a major  disaster."                   Although he used the word to refer to those who have  illegally entered the                 country, it had a different meaning from what he meant to  say, he said.                   "I did not intend to hurt Korean or other foreign residents  in Japan, and I am                 extremely regretful," Ishihara said in the statement,  promising that he would                 never again use the "inappropriate word," which is prone to  cause                 misunderstanding.                   On April 14, he expressed regret over his remarks, but  stopped short of                 acknowledging the derogatory import of the word "sangokujin"  and failed to                 apologize for having hurt the feelings of foreigners.                   Wednesday's statement was made in response to demands from                 metropolitan assembly members of Minshuto (Democratic Party  of Japan)                 asking that he retract his remarks and make a public apology.                   Ishihara handed the statement to senior Minshuto members of  the assembly                 after they held a meeting earlier in the day.                   The statement, to which Ishihara will affix the governor's  official seal, will                 become an official document.                   Hidejiro Kawai, secretary general of the Minshuto group  within the                 assembly, said, "An official document carries weight, which  will be                 tantamount to the governor's withdrawal of his remarks and  apology,"                 indicating that the group will not take the matter further.  
beck-s	 We are planning an ENA offsite on May 3rd and 4th at Columbia Lakes Resort  (West Columbia Texas).  You were all contacted to save these dates on your  calendars.  Both Cliff and I think this is an important opportunity for the  business units to get together to discuss strategies and opportunities. We  encourage you to attend for both days.  The goals of the offsite include:  a) to discuss strategies and commercial opportunities necessary to meet our  financial targets for 2000;  b) to discuss resource requirements and organizational issues;  and c) to provide an open forum to facilitate discussion and team building  amongst the businesses.  Each business unit will have one hour to present its strategies and  opportunities.  Specifically, we are asking the origination groups to  describe their current strategy, detail the top 5 commercial  deals/opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational  issues facing the unit.  Each trading organization will be asked to give a  short market overview of their markets, identify three market or trading  opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that  group.  Please submit your presentations to Kay Chapman no later than April  28, 2000.  The agenda is quite agressive but we wanted to give everyone an  opportunity to discuss their business.  A more detailed agenda and locations/times will follow shortly.  Regards Delainey

Although it would be great to get  people on board from within the company, I think we should just get the  postings out everywhere asap.  Also, Linda required the following questions to be answered: Internal or external posting?  To be posted both internally and externally  Are these positions already budgeted? No, they will have to come from out of  budget  Relocations costs to be provided? Relocation costs will be provided for  Specialist and above positions but not for Clerk, Senior Clerk positions.   The same also applies for agency fees, (yes to Specialist and above, and no  to clerk/senior clerk).  Here are the postings to be approved by Sally.  Thanks, Avril

beck-s	 Sally,  I wanted to forward the latest update for the Book-Split Project.  Although  you may not find the details of the update to be that exciting, I want you to  know that much work and time are being put into this effort.  Paul and Gregor  are the two Desk Directors for Continental Power who report to Joe Gold.   It's good to hear some feedback from them.  As you know, Kristin has now shown some interest in the EBS job with Barry  now that Fallen is moving.  When Barry and I first spoke about the position  which I would fill, I told him the Fallen might want Kristin since he knows  her and has worked with her the last 2 years.  Although the job sounds  interesting (Barry's a good salesman), there is not room for both Kristin and  myself.  I'll keep you updated on my discussions with Barry.

beck-s	 Rick:  Just want to provide a summary of our discussion on Wednesday, 4/19/2000  regarding the analyst program and the conclusions reached.  Discussion item #1:  Similarities and differences between the commercial and  commercial services analyst position.  Concluded that the only difference  between the two analyst profiles is the difference in merit and bonus  compensation.  Both have the opportunity to rotate across commercial and  commercial services areas, return to business school after two years, stay  and be promoted either to a commercial services professional position or take  a commercial route and ultimately be promoted to associate.  Agreed:  There is one analyst program and we will immediately eliminate the  compensation differences.  All analysts will receive the same 5K yearly merit  increase and be eligible for the commercial bonus range.  Discussion item #2:  Morale of analysts in program.  Due largely to  compensation differences making the program feel as though it is still two  separate programs.  Commercial services needs more attention and focus.  Need  someone of a Celeste Roberts calibre to focus on the staffing piece.  Agreed:  Eliminating the compensation differences will help boost morale.   Additionally, there needs to be more focus and attention paid to the career  development of analysts.    Discussion item #3:  UT Spring recruiting.  Did not feel there were enough  events and concerned that executive leads were not asked to participate.  Agreed:  Celeste Roberts will follow-up with George Hope and Shelly Jones to  confirm number of events and whether dates were booked on executive lead's  calendars.  Bottom line, we want to ensure that presence on campus is not  minimized.  Discussion item #4:  Off-line discussion with Sally Beck regarding the  Performance Review Process and whether all analysts would be reviewed as one  pool  Agreed:   Per Sally Beck it was agreed that all analysts would be reviewed  together.  We will not separate commercial from commercial services but will  put all analysts on the table and review as one analyst pool.   Please let me know if there are additional items that need to be captured.  Regards, Celeste Roberts

Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I  didn't realize you were not aware of the situation.   Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap  a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up  through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in  London on May 8th.  Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat  an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he  had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more  week, to May 15th.  Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his  plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend  since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now  wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.  Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S.  the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize  my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he  needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out  with him instead of returning early.  Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work  around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22  as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may  continue to drag on day-by-day.  Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and  Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how  strict "two full working days" is, we may actually need for him to be out no  later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Unfortunately, Kevin knew nothing about this.  So rather than discuss the  transition, Kevin had to react to and absorb this as a possibility.  He had  some very valid business reasons as to why Kristin's movement over the summer  months would be risky for ENA.  You and I can discuss those if you would  like.  His reaction was not "never", but instead was "not now".  He and  Kristin talked on Friday and agreed to a transition in mid August.

beck-s	 As you all are aware, there is a heightened awareness throughout the company  of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing  a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success  at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on  meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in  an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their  gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review  to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement  methodology for the London office.  In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards  across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment  for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and  other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and  Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.  I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so  that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those  control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not  operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to  develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:  - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash  collections are timely)  - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its  maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date  with            exceptions noted)  - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard  (i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)  - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each  measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)  I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control  functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of  work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time  requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to  be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a  high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but  it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.  As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for  each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk  associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and  power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know  if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.

Thanks. ---------------------- Forwarded by Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT on 05/11/2000  09:04 AM ---------------------------   Brent A Price 05/11/2000 07:55 AM To: Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Venturatos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lisa  Csikos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rita Wynne/HOU/ECT@ECT, Leslie Reeves/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Kristin Albrecht/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kim S Theriot/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dan  Houston/Corp/Enron@Enron, Stacey W White/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Houston Gas & Power Controls/Standards Assessment  As you all are aware, there is a heightened awareness throughout the company  of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing  a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success  at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on  meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in  an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their  gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review  to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement  methodology for the London office.  In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards  across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment  for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and  other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and  Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.  I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so  that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those  control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not  operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to  develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:  - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash  collections are timely)  - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its  maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date  with            exceptions noted)  - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard  (i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)  - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each  measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)  I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control  functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of  work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time  requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to  be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a  high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but  it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.  As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for  each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk  associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and  power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know  if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward  to seeing you next week.

beck-s	 Thanks for the summary. I was out last week so apologies if my comments  arrive too late. Here they are anyway:   1 Socrates  I think it inappropriate for me, or anyone in RAC for that matter, to have  primary responsibility for this system/project.  But if I were responsible the first thing I would want to know is why this  project, which commenced in May 1998, as I recall, is still incomplete, given  that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in  history, concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart.   2 Exhaustive ?  It doesn't look like an exhaustive list and I suspect it was not intended to  be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such.    3 Symptoms or Causes ?  Many of the points look like the former, and addressed as they stand will  likely leave us with a Band-aid solution which will drop off when pressure is  applied.  In fact many of them look like they are a result of Point 5 :    "Prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control  functionality..."  because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten, confirmation  errors get made, deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright  people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think  about changing the way they work. And, for example, when those people move  on, as they surely will, the institution has no memory of how to do what they  did.   I am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on  Microsoft Excel all day, everyday.    4 Overall  I think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way. Rather  than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking  off, we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate.  As a hypothesis, if most issues stem from Point 5, then I would ask why has  prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control  functionality ?

beck-s	 In my response to Brent Price on the London Doorstep review I alluded to the  incompleteness of the list of issues. As I outlined, the key point has been  identified, but its knock - on effects are widespread and worrying,  especially as they concern the Continental Power operation:  As of today the most recent finalised DPR for this business was for 11th May,  and during the period between then and now we have seen (although in milder  form) a repeat of the turmoil on the Amsterdam Power Exchange (APX) that we  witnessed in January this year. This is not the time or the market to not  know our position.  The business is soon to apply for higher limits to accommodate a new  transaction on the Polish border. I am bound to comment that based on the  state it appears to be in, I would not recommend higher limits.  To add insult to injury, as a result of the way this area has been allowed to  develop, much of the know-how is in the heads (and spreadsheets) of certain  key individuals who it seems are now bound rapidly for EBS.   UK Gas seems to have slipped too. Yesterday they reported a $7m loss due to  the value of a set of options which were part of a structured deal, booked  "off-system" and not revalued for over a month. Worryingly, there seemed to  be more time spent arguing over the nuances of a Loss Notification memo, than  answering some fundamental questions about why it happened.  As a corollary, our process of performing "risk reviews" has become all the  more important in identifying holes in our capture and treatment of market  risk in the firm. I expect these to play a big part in our effort to  stabilise these areas.

Milind     Wanda Curry@ECT 19-05-2000 08:49 PM To: Milind Laad/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Enron Trading    I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working  with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help  insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place  in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as  an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying  the coal.  Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the  London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to  determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These  books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd  party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local  curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and  energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading  activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process  (including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management  administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting  will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general  ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The  following questions need to be addressed:      With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be  required?       My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for  determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the        policy, if necessary.      What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?       The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure  required for the India office.      Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and  arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen  complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your  hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we  demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain  sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy.   Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date.    Thanks, Wanda Curry            To: Wanda Curry@ECT cc: Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT  Subject: Enron Trading  Wanda,  It was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to  review my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When  we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make  sure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room  for improvement later.  In addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the  accounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do  you plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.  Thanks and Regards.

beck-s	 Sally  Further to my message below of last week, I am enclosing a copy of the new  authorised signatories for Houston's records.    Can you please confirm that Sue Frusco has been advised of this change in the  procedures as we will now start signing the confirmations from Sydney?  Regards  Heidi   ---------------------- Forwarded by Heidi Mason/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on  24/05/2000 17:09 ---------------------------  From: Heidi Mason on 16/05/2000 11:17 To: Sally Beck@ECT cc:   Subject: Action plan  Sally  Thank you for taking the time to see me when I was in Houston, and for lunch.   I am working on a detailed comprehensive plan of action to enact the changes  we discussed re the settlement and confirmations procedures transfer. Due to  the volume of work that was on my desk upon my return this is not coming  together quite as quickly as I would like and therefore we are going to have  to look at it piece by piece.   We need to issue a new authorised signatory list this week for Enron  Australia Energy and Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd due to changes in the  dealer structure and therefore we have decided that this would be a good  opportunity to make the change to the approval of confirmations.   As agreed, we will have Sydney office take over responsibility for signing  all confirmations. This means they are still prepared in Sydney, as they are  now, with the change of procedure being that they will now be signed in  Sydney and faxed from here to our clients. The primary signatories will be  the Managing Director (Paul Quilkey) or the Chief Financial Officer (Heidi  Mason). In the event of both being unavailable they will be signed by the  Senior Legal Counsel (David Minns).   The confirmation log will be maintained in its entirety by Sydney Office and  will be held in a directory accessible by Houston. This will allow  independent audit review to occur as required.   In order to implement this change we have prepared a new authorised  signatories list which we are planning to distribute at the end of this week.  In the meantime could you please advise of what action needs to be taken in  Houston to ensure all the relevant areas are advised. Clearly a  key  individual will be Sue Frusco. When I met with Sue in Houston we discussed  briefly the fact that you and I had agreed that invoicing and confirmations  would move to Sydney but at that stage there was no timing raised. Sue seemed  happy to stay with the current arrangements until such time as we implemented  a change. Do you want me to advise Sue or will someone from Houston speak to  her?  Thanks  Heidi

beck-s	 We are continuing to work with the Enron LNG team to set up risk books and  capture the trading postions and P/L of their business.  At the present time  we are focusing on the Elba Island transaction, however, the LNG team has  requested information concerning an accrual book to accurately capture the  risks associated with their LNG Vessel "Mystic Lady" as well as an additional  vessel they are looking to acquire.  Eric Groves has built a curve generating model that will facilitate the risk  books and/or any exotic option models that may be necessary.   As of Friday,  we have not received the information needed to capture all of the FOB and  Delivered Curves.  We have been in contact with Enron LNG and they will be  forwarding this information.  We are expecting to sit down with the LNG  commercial team late next week to obtain assumptions such as product sourcing  locations and the timing of anticipated spot cargoes for delivery to Elba  Island.  Once we receive the additional information for the curves and the sourcing  assumptions, we will be in a position to sit down with the research group and  determine the most appropriate means of valuing these transactions.  We are  also working with the Europe Engineering group as a source of validating some  of the information that we have received.    Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.  Regards, Scott

beck-s	 Please call me once you have had a chance to read through the attached memo.   Obviously, this is a highly sensitive issue and is only being discussed on a  need to know basis to minimize the chances of this becoming known outside of  Enron.   Therefore, I would prefer not to discuss this issue in your staff  meeting.  Let me know if that's a problem.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT on 05/29/2000  04:01 PM ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	From:  Enron Canada General Announcement                           05/29/2000  03:26 PM 	  To: Everyone_in_ECT_Calgary, Everyone_In_ECT_Toronto cc: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron,  mhb@blakes.ca, dpef@blakes.ca  Subject: Industry Canada   PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL/SOLICITOR-CLIENT COMMUNICATION  This E:mail is to confirm the all employee staff meeting this morning.   As discussed, various representatives of Industry Canada will be in our  offices over the next number of days to investigate certain matters under the  authority of an Order granted in the Federal Court of Canada.    Industry Canada is pursuing an application with respect to certain  allegations involving Enron Canada Corp. and which we obviously believe to be  unsubstantiated, as will be ultimately proven in the normal course of  proceedings.    This memo is to confirm the following:  1. Each of the individuals from Industry Canada may enter into conversations  with you, ask you questions about our business or your business, ask you to  provide information, documentation, etc.  In this regard, Enron Canada  Corp.'s interests are represented by the law firm of Blake, Cassels &  Graydon.  Each member of Industry Canada has assigned to it a representative  of the firm of Blake, Cassels & Graydon, under the supervision of Dalton  McGrath, who is a partner with his firm.  You are not speak to or provide any  such information to any of the representatives of Industry Canada except  under the authority and direction of a representative of Blake, Cassels &  Graydon.  In other words, you are to advise the representatives of Industry  Canada that you need to seek the advice and instructions of counsel before  speaking with them or providing any information.  2. Although it is business as usual, as is the case whenever we have any  outside visitors in the office, it is important to maintain the  confidentiality of your business and your information.  In other words, the  representatives of Industry Canada are here for a specified purpose and they  should be treated no differently than any other third parties when you are  discussing, negotiating or documenting transactions that do not concern them.  3. It is Enron Canada Corp.'s intention to be cooperative and  non-obstructive.  At the same time, it is both appropriate and customary that  we do not assist the representatives of Industry Canada in doing their jobs.   In other words, they know what they are looking for, and it is appropriate  and customary for us not to point them in any particular direction, which may  be the right or wrong direction.  Again, documentation and information  requests are to be handled directly through Blake, Cassels & Graydon under  the supervision of Dalton McGrath.  4. If the representatives of Industry Canada take any information (whether in  physical, electronic or other form) it is imperative that through a  representative of Blake, Cassels & Graydon that information is inventoried,  and please ensure that this is the case.  All such information will be  subject to a legal privilege and therefore it is important to specifically  identify any information requested or acquired.  5. Although this matter may come out in the public domain, either  intentionally or unintentionally, it is imperative that this matter not  become in the public domain through any act or omission of an Enron Canada  Corp. employee.  It is a duty of your employment, consistent with any other  matter affecting your employment, that this matter be kept strictly  confidential and within the confines of Enron Canada Corp. (i.e. not to be  discussed with your counterparts in Houston) on a need to know basis.  This  includes, particularly with representatives of Industry Canada in the office,  that this matter is not the subject of gossip or "coffee talk".    6. If you receive a request to discuss this matter through the media or other  such outlet, you are not to respond to that request, and all matters should  be referred to Rob Milnthorp, who will deal with them appropriately.  If the  requests come from customers, competitors, acquaintances, family,  counterparts in Houston, and the like, you are simply to advise that you are  unable to discuss the matter.  7. All matters are to be handled through the following people:  Rob Milnthorp, for all commercial matters; Peter Keohane, for all legal matters; and Dalton McGrath or one of his designated representatives of Blake, Cassels &  Graydon.  I want to emphasize that Enron Canada Corp. is doing all of the appropriate  things to ensure that our rights and interests are protected, while being as  cooperative as possible.  I want to emphasize the Enron Canada Corp. believes  any claim made by or through Industry Canada is without merit, and the steps  we have taken should only be viewed as prudent and not as any indication of  any liability by Enron Canada Corp.  Regards, Peter

beck-s	 Hi Ted,  I had Sally blocked off from 11:00 to 1:00 for lunch this Thursday, but we  will need to change time to 11:30 instead - a meeting that she must attend  has been scheduled until 11:30. Sally says it would be great if you and Tim  pick her up out front at that time.  Do you have a cell phone number?  I will  make reservations for the 3 of you at Irma's.  Also,  I talked to Cathy in Mike McConnell's office about lunch June 20.   Unfortunately, he will be in S. Korea during that time.  Per Cathy, he is  making 3 overseas trips this month (S. Korea, Brazil & Japan) so he will be  quite busy.  She did say for you to keep trying.

Patti,  Go ahead and schedule lunch for Thursday, June 1st. I am trying to reschedule my Thursday lunch for Wednesday. If not, Tim Rasnic, of the J.C.Penney Leadership Program will be able to go, as he is going to be in Houston that day and also needs to visit with Sally about the upcoming Fall events with Enron. I am hoping I can rearrange my schedule and joining them. If not, I know I will be in Houston again on June 19 & 20 and will reschedule with Sally if she is available on those dates (please check her calendar and let me know). I will let you know about next Thursday soon as I find out.  Thanks for your efforts in coordinating this.  Ted K.

beck-s	 I think I'm unclear on some points.    The accomplishments by 6/19 is for Directors and above - to Sally.   Individual groups under Sally will probably set their deadlines PRIOR to the  smaller PRC's. I did not understand that Promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting  with Sally nor did I understand that the employee had to be in their role for  1 year.    I thought the Promotion discussion would be an agenda item of  PRC.  Additionally, I understood the Mid-Year promotion listing would not be  as extensive as year-end, maintaining the year-end as the primary promotion  time.  Can you clarify?  Thanks.

beck-s	 Attached is a resume for a gentleman who has relocated as a trailing expat  spouse to Houston, who we are looking to find a suitable position somewhere  in Enron. I know that one or two of you have already seen his resume and at  the time didn't necessarily have a role for him. I would be very grateful if  you could take another look and see if anything has now changed.  By way of background, he was previously working with Eastern in the UK in a  back office capacity looking at their approach to the UK Gas regulatory  framework known as the Network code. He has done a little consulting work  since relocating to Houston in the online area. His references are very good.  He is available with immigration clearance as a local hire, probably at  Senior Specialist level. As an additional "incentive" I would be prepared to  underwrite his costs in the event you decided in the first 6 months that his  performance did not meet your expectations (Obviously - I am highly confident  this will not be the case!).    
beck-s	 The only conversation I have had with Jeff regarding this topic was when I  was in Houston and he had inquired as to when I was returning, stating that  he was going to need some help in integrating another business within Gas  Trading (and alluded to the possibility of it being Liquids related).  My  thoughts are that it would need to be supported out of my group since it is  going to roll up to Jeff.  Do you want me to set up a conference call with  you, Scott Earnest and myself to discuss?  Subsequent to that we should  probably have a conference call with Jeff to get specifics.  Let me know what  I need to do on this.  Brent       	Enron North America Corp.

(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably  what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will  assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.    Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely  over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this  business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with  Jeff on this?

beck-s	 Sally  I feel I already know you having had the benefit of sitting next to Brent for  the last few months- but I realise I have been impolite in not organising a  call just to introduce myself and arrange dates for a visit to Houston.  Additionally Brent, Shona and I have spent some excellent time on the subject  of Internal Control Enivronment / Operational Risk / Doorstep and I wanted to  agree potential next steps with you. Do you have anytime today / tomorrow ?  Regards  Mike 
beck-s	 I am seeking information on where to find copies of LNG Contracts that were  previously in the domain of the old Enron International company.   Enron  North America will be establishing a risk book to manage LNG positions on a  worldwide basis and we need copies of all contracts to set this up.  These  contracts may or may not be related to the Dabhol project.  If you can  provide guidance or information as to where to find these contracts, I would  appreciate it.  You may respond via email or call me at 713-853-6079 in  Houston.  Thank you for your attention.

beck-s	 Jeff,  We will definitely need a lot more information related to the items below.   Please let me know when we can meet and discuss these.  Some of the items we  will need to know include:  We discussed discrepancies your team noted between the spreadsheet positions  that are being captured and what's reported on the Gas BM report.  This is  causing you to manually adjust the Gas BM report.  Is this for all  spreadsheet positions?  Some of them?  Is the variance significant?  Is it  off everyday?   What do you mean by " All Transport Models".   Does this mean positions?  Are  transport positions on the Gas BM report?  Are they manual adjustments?  Are  they in GRMS?  Can we capture these with spreadsheets? What is your current methodology in preparing the Gas BM report for  roll-offs?  Is it currently consistent across all regions or is it handled  differently by different traders?  Please explain this in further detail. The  Basis roll-off was done in the GRMS system in the past.  Is this still the  case?  If not, we need to capture these roll-off adjustments using  spreadsheets? Can we make the Fixed Price Canadian Deals adjustments using spreadsheets  that can be captured in GRMS? Also, what is the status of capturing IM-Canada positions in the system?  We will need this type of information urgently.  We are meeting with Jeff  Shankman on Tuesday to update him on the progress we are making.    Please let me know if there is anything we can do to help.  Thanks, Mike       	Enron North America Corp.

beck-s	 Thanks David,  I am addressing the 'undue influence' issue via the PRC process, but we all  know that this is a partial solution - it's about changing the culture  (Europe isn't any better or worse in this respect) and this is a more  intransigent problem that we need to work at every single day (I have to say  that the Helsinki scare was really helpful in this respect - I think you  would notice a difference).  I'll ask James and Mike to follow up on your specific points.  Regards  Fernley         From:  David Port @ ENRON                                                              12/06/2000 19:35	 	 	 	                            	  To: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Steve W Young/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit     Sorry to hear about this one.   I have some observations to make from my reading (and re-reading) of the  account:  1 It looks like the old "undue influence" problem again. It seems some  attempts were made by operations to follow up, but nothing happened.   We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don't  have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if  they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career. And that  is because twice a year, at the PRC, that can happen. This incident shows  some of these attributes.  For the operations process to be effective there has to be (and be seen to  be) little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of  the operations staff.   2 Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm  the basis on which they signed it.  3 Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? Brokerage is in  the P&L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage  is at the agreed rate, they should simply pay the brokerage.  4 Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same  day. I would not have waited for the traders to do it, but I would want to  know why it took them so long.  5 Given that these (short) trades were absent from the portfolio during a  highly volatile period of rising prices, I would wonder about motivation in  addressing the position during this time. Essentially, if it had been correct  we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did.  I would pursue explanations to points 2, 4 and 5.

As described, this is an intolerable situation. I agree  your action points, but we need timelines and quantitative measures of  compliance/improvement - please could you provide a weekly update on this  area specifically and until we are satisfied that things are as they should  be.  On a more general note - let's ensure that the 'Global Standards' address the  lapses in timely action/follow-up identified here so that we can monitor  performance across the business.  Fernley    James New 09/06/2000 10:03 To: Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike  Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Robert Yeo/LON/ECT@ECT, Gail Hill/LON/ECT@ECT, Ian Sloman/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit   On the 7th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that two'late' trades had  been entered into the gas trader's 'Blue book' which were both being booked  significantly late and had a material negative P&L impact (negative o1.1m).  The 'late' deals were done on the 3rd of February (Marcello Romano) and the  30th of March (Haakon Olafson) and were both forward starting sells for  periods in 2003-2004.  Background  1) Input errors  For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal  input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most  significant number coming form the UK Gas traders. Numerous errors have been  found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness  of entering deals into the 'blue book' (the Gas traders are currently the  only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation  system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support  of John Sherriff with a deadline date of 31 July).  In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted  booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen. A log of  all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May  which highlights an error rate of 12%-15% of non EOL trades. This has been  discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected.  2) Deal booking and reconciliation process (Non EOL trades)  Deals are initially written into the 'blue book' by the gas traders when the  deal is done. This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are  the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day.  Faxed broker statements are received (usually) by documentation the next day  and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by  documentation liasing with the traders as necessary. At this time brokers  were faxing one statement per trade (relevant later).  3) New Deal sign off  As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is  signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and  the implied origination P&L. For the 3rd of February Marcello signed off the  new deals sheet and for the 30th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off.  4) Documentation convention  In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation.  (relevant later). Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after  trade booking.  5) Brokerage invoices  Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then  reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the  deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to  authorise for payment. Any deals which cannot be found are raised with  documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders.   Specific details of these 'late' trades  1) Summary  For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving, or can it be  established that we did not receive, a broker statement which is a primary  control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals.   As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from  either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade.  The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements  in April and was completed by the 20th with the invoices falling due for  payment on the 27th. The work practice at that time was that brokerage  invoices (including those with non reconciling trade queries) were batched  together and passed to the traders. This would have taken place on the 27th  of April. Details on exactly what was said and done in the 3 weeks between  passing these invoices to the traders for approval (although there are claims  that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions) and when a mailed  follow up was made on the 22nd of May are hazy. What is clear is that on the  22nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position  which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred.  Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals  being booked on the 6th of June.  2) Deal specifics  EES Broker - Morgan Stanley trade on 3 Feb 2000 Trader Marcello EES Invoice date 1 March; Invoice received before 15 March as settlements  started checking it. (Keren Perrott - settlements started on 13 March) Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Emma Thomson) Traders contacted  on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 May  as requested by documentation to prove deal. Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.   IEB Broker - NP trade on 30 Mar 2000 Trader Haakon IEB invoice date 6 April; Invoice received before 27 April as settlements  started checking it. (Keren Perrott) Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn) Traders contacted on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was requested. Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.     Who was at fault and where did the control break down ?  I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but  there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that  can be made and drawn.  Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas trader's accuracy and  prioritisation of booking trades. Despite numerous conversations on the  subject very little improvement has been seen. It has now got to the stage  where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the  error was and who made it. This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis  every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time  trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to  avoid the incidence of errors such as this. The current error rate is 12% -  15% of non EOL trades. Documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out  of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct.  Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to  provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will  eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately  obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived. Most brokers have now  changed but one or two still send one statement per trade. Reconciliation's  of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced.  Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow  up more vigorously (and by mail) errors and omissions on a more timely basis.  There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by  settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders. This is  causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment.  Action Points  Trading  Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk  Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking  Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis  Trade Support  Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices  Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual  deal statements  All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate  Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the  broker records  Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree  our forward position from July 2000 to September 2006 (the traded part of the  curve)           
beck-s	 Hi - I just wanted to give you a quick run down on the meeting yesterday.   Three people spoke at the meeting - Jeff McMahon, Louise and Philippe.  There  was a lot of attention given to EnronOnline and it's success.  Greg Whalley  spoke via satellite from London.  The basic theme was what it is going to  take to survive in today's fast moving markets and how we are going to get  there, and that in five years all businesses will be Internet companies or  not companies at all.....    Greg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand  existing platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do  this but us because of our financial capabilities, reputation, and IT  resources.    Louise went over statistics, products offered, etc. on EnronOnline.  Philippe discussed all the IT projects in the works - the key one for ENA was  enhancement of deal capture, valuation and settlements (no surprises  there!).  One other common theme was streamlining our current systems.   He  also confirmed the fact that we were moving from Lotus Notes to Exchange, and  discussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our  equipment (and the ability to keep the room cool) so they were looking to  Ardmore for this.    Jeff M. stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on  inefficiencies in the market, and get into other industries (e.g. MG Metals  in Europe).  He also stated that Enron was going to Venture Capitalists for  financial support and backing.  Of course, this means that Enron will have to  give up some control, but it leads to increased deal flow, market share and  new ideas....  He said the initial backing will be in the neighborhoods of  $1B - most likely in Q3.    I tried to capture the main topics, let me know if you have any questions!  Sheri 
beck-s	 FYI...according to Jeff, by the end of today the only position that will  require manual adjustment is an IM Canada position (60 K's) that will be  fixed next Monday when Kam Keiser goes back to Calgary.

Here are the things which we  discussed earlier.  Mike - Let me know if you need anything else.  We have lowered the number of top-level adjustments substantially this week.   We have taken several steps in order to achieve this.  1.  We had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into GRMS.   2.  We are using a flip-out book for all Canadian deals done with the U.S.  office so that Canadian positions are pulling in correctly. 3.  We had to adjust many book names in order that GRMS would pull the books  into the system.   4.  We had to change region codes in the system so that GRMS would pull in  more than one book per region.  Issues remaining:  Intra-Month Canada Chicago Storage and Intra-East  Intra-month Canada - We have a risk person from the U.S. office going to  Canada on Monday to fix their problems. Chicago -  will be fixed by the end of the day.  System is looking for the  wrong portfolio code. Storage and Intra-East - Also will be fixed by the end of the day.  Overide  books need to be set up.  Thanks  JG

He won't change the world, but he is diligent  about getting a prescribed job done.  I personally like Bob a lot, and am  very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His  wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we  jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order  to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able  to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a  caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitment  to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and  predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will  personally make sure that works for him.  I would hope for him that if he  ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.    Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what  impact it would have on gas if he moved.  I suggested that Brent would be  better able to address that.  I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL  transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that  they are not long on people.

beck-s	 Mike - thanks I got it eventually.  The only thing I would add at this stage would be under "Daily Management P&L  and position reporting..."  "Key positional and valuation data delivered to corporate risk aggregation  system ("RisktRAC") by a pre - determined time"  The form and content of that data I outlined in my last tome.     This will allow us to (amongst other things) get the positions aggregated and  perform some level of assessment, and allow you folks to kill the spreadsheet  you currently use to calculate VAR, because RisktRAC has the VAR engine.

Mike  ---------------------- Forwarded by Mike Jordan/LON/ECT on 19/06/2000 13:23  ---------------------------   Mike Jordan 19/06/2000 11:19 To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Continental Power - the case for greater experience/breadth of view  in the controllers' position  Sally  Further to our discussion on Friday I summarise my view of Joe Gold's issues  with the MO control process  Joe expressed some frustration with the current status as follows: -  The DPR has historically been 'filled with noise' around adjustments for  edits on trades, provision restatements etc which negates it's effectiveness  for him as a control/supervisory report  The risk team appear to have been reacting to p&l 'noise'  - particularly  around transmission adjustments rather than proactively finding booking  solutions - or instructing IT to flex Enpower Settlements have gained a perception in the market place for 'errors' such  that originators are informing Joe that business is being 'lost' due to our  perceived inability to support transactions - ( must be careful here as no  specifics on errors have been provided ) The risk team ( post Neil Tarling's transfer to EBS ) is relatively junior  and does not possess many 'years' of experience of Power support James New as Power,Gas and Credit Controller has ( necessarily ) too broad a  role for him to focus on these detailed issues  In mitigation  The recent continental book split ( which is only now being 'settled' in to  the daily process) and the clean up of historic provisions/reserves prior to  Neil Tarling's transfer has exaggerated the base issue around certainty of  daily p&l Designing an approximate booking process for transmission has not been a top  priority for the risk team in the recent past ( this was either wrong or the  prioritisation call  was not  effectively communicated to Joe ) - and it is  felt that there are no IT resources to code  these solutions to Enpower (  also London struggles to influence Houston IT resource prioritisation ) The settlements infrastructure has been supporting a business volume growth  it is not designed for and supporting acitivity on this platform requires  'skilled' staff ( we are down on resources for Continental Power ) -  continuing growth in volumes are expected along with junior settlement staff  being asked to join Commercial groups We are  experiencing  generational  change as a result of Barry's move to EBS  - resourcing is James and my top priority  I believe what Joe is asking for, is what we are trying to provide - namely :  upgrade in resourcing in the risk group where we are insisting that the lead  individual has full responsibility, end to end, for the business including  the assessment of operational risk and effectiveness of the business process, focus on identifying and implementing the necessary quick hit solutions that  eliminates 'manual workarounds' and consequently 'noise' in the process more proactive communication with Commercial - especially to manage  expectations a definitive plan for how the strategic upgrade in applications architecture  for MO will benefit/change his business support  However, we are behind in finding the 'right' replacement for Neil ( one with  experience and breadth of view potential ), we have found a continental power  settlemetns manager but he does not arrive until July 3 rd, we have been  struggling with book split when that should have been completed a month ago  and it is taking time to get all the ducks lined up re our plans for  Enlighten/DTL/EnVoice/Autoconfirms/DCAF - hence his frustration about lost  business opportunities NOW!!  Hence I would love to find someone who could deliver the above ( ie be Neil  Tarling's replacement ) or could assist us in providing and communicating the judgement calls on transmission and other  adjustments - so improving perception of C.P. DPR prioritising and influencing Enpower development agenda ( along with others ) project manage issues around 'unstable' documentation and settlement process  vis a vis client sensitivity provide leadership in changing expectations/perceptions  I'm sorry for the length of the note but it may help you in determining a  'best fit' person   Please call if any of the above is unclear.

A few weeks back, Sydney started executing their own Confirms, where in the  past, it had been done in Houston by myself.   Since I have not heard of this  from Houston, I would not be doing my job if I let this go unquestioned.  I  assume this is a policy change?  They are also making advances towards becoming an Asian hub.   As such, there  are a few responsibilities that I currently handle, which Sydney is looking  to take over:  - Houston independently reconciles the broker statements daily;   the  Settlements Clerk could handle;  - All settlements are approved by me in Houston;  the new Settlements Clerk  could handle this as well, or someone     in Houston could signoff on payment before Treasury takes action.  I guess I'm looking for assurances that Sydney is supposed to become a hub,  and some information on exactly how autonomous they should become.   Are they  to be completely independent, or are there to be a minimum level of controls  between offices?

beck-s	 Sally, Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you  were looking to set up for your group.  I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them  about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on  the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the  possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although  they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the  activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format.  They are a very busy company, in much demand both within Enron and other  companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September  21-22.  Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October  onwards - but that may be less of a fit).  How does this fit with your group? Let me know if you want to discuss this further  Tim 36698 
beck-s	 By now, most of you are aware that Enron will be acquiring London-based MG= =20 Plc, one of the world=01,s leading metals marketers.  In connection with ou= r=20 on-going activities relating to MG Plc, I thought it would be helpful to=20 provide you with a brief overview of on our future new metals business, to= =20 further explain the reasons underlying the acquisition and to update you on= =20 the integration team=01,s accomplishments to date.  What is MG Plc? MG Plc is a leading, independent international metals trading business, whi= ch=20 provides a variety of services to the global metals industry. The business= =20 dates back to 1881 when it was the German Metallgesellschaft Group and was= =20 active in trading metals from its head office in Frankfurt.  Today, MG is o= ne=20 of the world=01,s top non-ferrous metals brokers and market makers, the wor= ld=01,s=20 leading independent copper merchant and a leading merchant of many other=20 non-ferrous metals.  MG is comprised of two core areas of expertise, the Financial Services and= =20 Merchanting Divisions.  The Financial Services Division was formed in 1970 = to=20 provide market-making and trading services to the MG=01,s physical metals= =20 trading business through futures trading as a member of the London Metal=20 Exchange and, at a later date, as a member of COMEX in New York.  In the la= te=20 1980s, as a result of London=01,s growing leading role in the metals indust= ry,=20 MG established a merchant trading office in London.  In 1986, MG developed= =20 its warehousing division with the acquisition of Henry Bath.  In 1999, the= =20 Merchanting and Financial Services Divisions, including warehousing, were= =20 combined into a single company, which was floated on the London Stock=20 Exchange.  Currently, MG=01,s core trading offices are located in London an= d New=20 York with warehouse operations in Liverpool, Humberside, Rotterdam, New=20 Orleans, New Haven, and Singapore. It has merchanting offices in Lima,=20 Santiago, Los Angeles, Chicago, Stockholm, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, New= =20 Delhi, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo and Melbourne.  What does the Merchanting Division do? The Merchanting Division is the world=01,s leading independent copper merch= ant,=20 one of the top three independent merchants of copper concentrates and nicke= l=20 and one of the leading European merchants of recycled non-ferrous metals. T= he=20 division also trades in other non-ferrous metals on the London Metals=20 Exchange (LME), including lead, tin, zinc, aluminium and brass.  The Merchanting Division engages in the following main activities:  ? Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals =01) MG trades as a principal with prod= ucers=20 and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and concentrates=20 (particularly copper, aluminium and nickel), exchanging qualities and=20 locations and lending and borrowing metals. ? Global Stockholding =01) MG holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehou= ses=20 around the world. ? Merchanting of Recycled Metal =01) MG trades as a principal with supplier= s and=20 consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling. ? Terminal Market Operations =01) MG participates in the LME and COMEX usin= g=20 hedging, arbitrage and position management to support its merchanting=20 activity.  What does the Financial Services Division do? The Financial Services Division is one of the leading LME members and, base= d=20 on the volume of LME metals stored, is one of the leading LME metals=20 warehousing businesses.  The Financial Services Division engages in the following main activities:  ? Brokerage Activities =01) MG executes orders as a broker for clients in L= ME=20 and COMEX contracts. ? Market-Making =01) MG is a market-maker for both futures and options cont= racts=20 and COMEX and OTC contracts. ? Warehousing =01) MG stores metals and other goods in eleven locations in= =20 Europe, the United States and Asia.  MG has also begun to prepare to trade non-ferrous metals using the internet= =20 as its platform.  On 10th February, MG announced the formation of a joint= =20 venture with Internet Capital Group, Inc. and Safeguard International Fund,= =20 L.P. to develop an internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals. The= =20 joint venture, called EMETRA, intends to establish a world-wide=20 business-to-business, e-commerce trading platform for the non-ferrous metal= s=20 markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options= =20 contracts.  Why is Enron acquiring MG? Enron is committed to expanding its position as a global leader in wholesal= e=20 markets. By expanding into new wholesale markets, such as non-ferrous metal= s,=20 Enron expects to leverage its wholesale expertise and will be able to offer= =20 customers new products and solutions to address their business needs which= =20 link different commodities and inputs.  MG will provide Enron with a number of important benefits.  At the same tim= e,=20 Enron expects that MG will significantly benefit from its association with= =20 Enron.  Some of the benefits we envisage include:  ? The opportunity to combine Enron=01,s core competencies in trading, finan= ce=20 and origination with MG=01,s global position in trading non-ferrous metals.  ? The ability for both Enron and MG to access new clients, particularly in= =20 the United States and Europe.  ? The ability to cross-market both existing products and new products such = as=20 bundled products that offer combined metals and power outsourcing.  ? The ability to leverage the opportunities available to MG by increasing i= ts=20 financial strength and the resources available to it.  ? The chance to overlay the EnronOnline business-model on the metals indust= ry=20 to increase liquidity and contract market share.  What remains to be done? Merging the business operations of two entities, even highly motivated=20 companies such as Enron and MG, has been and will continue to be a formidab= le=20 and daunting exercise.  Having a shared vision facilitates rapid integratio= n,=20 but there are many complicated and complex tasks that remain.  During the= =20 conditional offer period, Enron and MG are taking steps to prepare for a=20 seamless and non-disruptive integration of our respective operations. =20 Ideally, when Enron=01,s offer to buy all MG shares becomes unconditional (= 15=20 July 2000 is the current target date), the two can hit the ground with thei= r=20 feet running.  In the short term, a number of things must be accomplished to facilitate th= at=20 smooth transition.  Most importantly, in order to ensure that the deal goes= =20 forward, Enron and MG will work to remove the remaining conditions to Enron= =01,s=20 offer, including obtaining the shareholder approvals from all shareholders = as=20 well as obtaining relevant regulatory consents.  A number of other steps must be taken, however, during the first phase of o= ur=20 integration timetable to ensure that everything stays on track.

beck-s	 Sally, I understand your comments.  I'll get you an outline of the programme and I'll also see if I can create  some other options for you. I'll provisionally book the suppliers in case you've got over your irritation  by September - so we don't lose those dates.  Tim       	 	 	From:  Sally Beck @ ECT                           06/20/2000 04:16 PM 	  To: Tim O'Rourke/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:    Subject: Re: VAR training    Thanks for your front-end research on this.  It's too bad that the training  provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is  an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for  this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away  from the desk is not very workable either.    After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to  book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be  desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.     Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this  decision?  Thanks.  --Sally     Tim O'Rourke@ENRON 06/19/2000 04:11 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: VAR training  Sally, Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you  were looking to set up for your group.  I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them  about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on  the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the  possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although  they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the  activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format.  They are a very busy company, in much demand both within Enron and other  companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September  21-22.  Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October  onwards - but that may be less of a fit).  How does this fit with your group? Let me know if you want to discuss this further  Tim 36698     
beck-s	 Could everyone please notify Phil Redman (and cc Eric Gadd and myself) of any  planned absences (holiday etc) until the end of September  Thanks  Esther 
beck-s	 As you know, we have substantially wrapped up our work related to this  project.  Today, we are making what I hope are final changes to the maps and  deliverables, with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete  binders by Wednesday.    One issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment  processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the  automated Unify/SAP environment.  This issue was raised by Melissa during our  discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability  of SAP to auto-match cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the  money has moved or been received, but the corresponding JE has not been made  in SAP.  Both Melissa and Cindy Morrow have been involved in subsequent  discussions related to the below-mentioned risks.   1.  Risk of JE and payment duplication:  Payments taken directly to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in  Unify:  In the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is  entered initially into Unify (which would be the case for all normal  commodity payments, excluding broker fee and broker margin payment  transactions), a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid  twice (once by either A/P or Treasury when the manual payment is wired and  subsequently recorded, and once during the normal Unify to SAP interface).   Process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk; however, all  controls will be people-based, not system-based.  It is too late to rebuild  the Unify to SAP interface to better address the use of manual payments.  One  additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of  manual payments except under well-defined, important circumstances.  Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly  to SAP (does not go through Unify): If the payment is not entered into SAP with payment method "J", A/P will not  realize that the payment has already been made and will process the  disbursement a second time.  2.  Risk of understated expense:  Payments taken to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in Unify: For manual payments that are not finalized in Unify (a process performed in  the system to mark an invoice as final) by month-end (but the disbursement  has already happened), expense will be understated.  Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly  to SAP (does not go through Unify): If payment is not input into SAP by month-end but cash has moved, expense  will be understated.  (Cash outflow account will show a credit balance which  will be flipped to A/P, but no income statement entry will be made at that  time.)  3.  Risk of cash misappropriation:  In addition to the above risks related to the use of manual payments, we also  believe that a risk exists related to the use of Excel-generated counterparty  invoices and the lack of segregation between the person responsible for  preparing these invoices and also for handling/having access to the related  accounting records.  We believe that it may be possible for a settlements  coordinator to change the bank routing instructions or bank account number on  the Excel invoice mailed to the counterparty and then manipulate the  accounting records during the cash application process to either write off  the account balance or to reflect the receivable as being paid while  constantly moving cash application balances from one counterparty to another  (so that no one account balance ages past an acceptable range).  We have been  unable to determine a set of control procedures that would mitigate this risk.  4.  Revision to counterparty banking details:  We are currently investigating the procedure performed by Treasury when  problems with bank account details cause payments to kick-out of Treasury  workstation.  If the risk of misappropriation exists related to this  procedure, we will separately communicate.  The above may be unclear.  If so, we would be glad to sit down with you for  15 minutes or so and clarify.  Please let me know if you have any questions.    Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project.

beck-s	 Sally, overview of programme elements as requested. Let me know if you have any  questions or want further details.  Tim  VALUE AT RISK  The Value at Risk (VaR) seminar is designed to introduce participants to this  important concept.  An understanding of VaR is rapidly becoming an integral  business need.  The first session of this seminar provides participants with  a comprehensive review of statistics, these being the primary building block  of VaR itself.  The program then moves on to identify examples of the context  in which clients are using VaR in their business decisions.  Participants  will gain an understanding of the interrelationship of the many factors that  make VaR a dynamic and strategic tool.  The program ends with a "hands on"  experience of making a simple VaR calculation.  Participants attending this seminar will be able to:  Give a precise definition of Value at Risk Describe how VaR is changing the way companies evaluate risk in their  businesses Discuss how these changing views of risk will impact the use of hedging   products Recognize why companies are implementing VaR Explain the key factors in calculating VaR Understand the need to categorize risk into "Risk Buckets" Define the standardizing practice of Risk Mapping Illustrate a simple VaR model and accurately discuss the modeling          process Calculate a simple two product VaR number Demonstrate the difference between the Historical, Monte Carlo and Risk  Metrics  approaches to VaR Evaluate the impact of correlation on the calculation of VaR Understand the application and importance of stress testing

beck-s	 Mr. Hall, I have just reviewed the Merchant Portfolio Summary for 6/20 and have the  following questions:  1) CALME shows an asset of $291.9MM  and APACHI shows an asset of $113.0MM  and they show no p&l for the year   Is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums  and commodity prices?  2) India recently invested in an IPO (rediff.com) for which there was a  simultaneous DASH to buy and sell (sounds like a Merchant deal).   Where does this show up?  3) There are several bonds (publicly traded, registrered securities, housed  in our Prime Broker accounts) owned by various Enron entities   that I do not believe are on the DPR.  Shouldn't they be? And if so, who is  deciding not to include? Pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do. Thanks Ted       	 	 	From:  D Todd Hall                           06/21/2000 01:16 PM 	  To: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Andrea V Reed/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Carol Jean  Marshall/HOU/ECT@ECT, Raymond Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff  Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Donahue/HOU/ECT@ECT, L'Sheryl  Hudson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Monica Reasoner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Hope Vargas/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Adarsh Vakharia/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joseph W Sutton@Enron, Michael S  Galvan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Maria LeBeau/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wes Colwell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark  Frevert/NA/Enron@Enron, Thomas Myers/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: MPR for 6/20/00    
beck-s	 Ted,  Question 1)  The investments in CALME and APACHI are booked on an accrual  basis.  I have had several meetings with Commercial and Accounting    representatives over the last year and all have stated that any earnings are  effectively reinvested back into the Assets.  Therefore, the   Market Values  that are reflected on the MPR are actually Book Values.  The Book Values are  typically adjusted the last week of the month   and are 1 month behind as the  Internation groups wait until the GL is closed before communicating the  updated values.  Question 2)  Thanks for the heads-up on India.  I spoke with Sheila Glover  and we are now aware of the details behind Rediff.com.  We need to ensure    that these positions are not accounted for on the DPR by India so that we do  not double-report the P&L.  The long-term solution is to   establish a  communication line for future investments.  Between Sheila, Donna Lowry, and  I we can develop a plan.    Question 3)  The 3 bonds that you are referencing were purchased by Jeff  Kinneman for Jim Easter.  During our last conversation, Jim told Jeff that  these   are Strategic investments and should not be reflected on the MPR.   There is still some uncertainty/confusion as to when an investment is  classified as Merchant.  We could insist that all publically traded  investments not included in the Equity books would qualify.  Having said  that, I would like to know if the Gas Authority of India, Ltd (GAIL) and  Europe's investment in MG are considered to be Merchant investments.  I will be on vacation this Friday and all of next week so please include  David Maxwell on any responses.  David and I will stay in touch so as to make  adjustments as needed.  Thanks, Todd         From:  Ted Murphy                                                              06/22/2000 03:07 PM	 	 	 	                            	  To: D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick Buy  Subject: Re: MPR for 6/20/00    Mr. Hall, I have just reviewed the Merchant Portfolio Summary for 6/20 and have the  following questions:  1) CALME shows an asset of $291.9MM  and APACHI shows an asset of $113.0MM  and they show no p&l for the year   Is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums  and commodity prices?  2) India recently invested in an IPO (rediff.com) for which there was a  simultaneous DASH to buy and sell (sounds like a Merchant deal).

beck-s	 Hi,  Yesterday Debbie and I stepped the P&P group through the Doorstep findings.  We set the scene, went through the report item by item, and put the findings  into context, e.g. learning points from Coal.  Collectively, we are comfortable that required actions have been implemented.   At present the group are on the cusp of transitioning from an origination  group feeding deals into the Houston risk book, into a fully fledged trading  unit with physical assets in Europe. Riveria - a potential acquisition of two  paper mills in Southern France - and/or other acquisitions would be the  catalyst for this transition.  The group are currently assessing their Commercial, Support and other  infrastructure resource requirements in order to manage this growth in a  controlled way. I have sent them the attachment - Roles & Responsibilities  matrix for Global - which has recently been tailored for a presentation Mike  Jordan will be making to MG, and will try to stick close and help them  through this process.     Any questions, please call.  Regards, Tim

beck-s	 Please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e-mails.  The privilege of using Enron's balance sheet comes with the responsibility to  adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to. It is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating VAR in a  product that has been approved for trading for several months.  It is equally  appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance  of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable.   Obviously, the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible.  It  lies with both commercial and commercial support management.  I know that  airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh.  This is not the  point.  This is not an isolated problem.  It is not just pertaining to  Europe. Please do not feel singled out.  But the scrutiny and pressure on VAR  as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace.  We can hardly make any  progress if this is the pervasive attitude.  Let's knock this stuff out one  at a time.

beck-s	 Notes from Naomi Connell's NY meetings have been posted on  S\Mg\Administration\Meeting Reports under  MG NY - Overview.doc MG NY - Support.doc MY NY - Cu concentrates.doc 
beck-s	 I know that you do not need numbers until late next month, but I thought you  might want an early look at May.  One number is particularly interesting: VaR for the Total Return Swaps.  You  will notice that it decreased substantially from about $20 million in March  to about $8 million in May.  We had several deals that expired (Churchill,  Piti Guam, and Blackbird), reducing risk,  and only one new one (Motown).   Most importantly, we cut back on our exposure to Rhythms from 5.4 million  shares in April to 4.7 million in May, and the stock price continued to fall  from $36 to $21 to $16 per share (the less the investment is worth, the less  we can lose in it).  We will send you June numbers as we collect them.  Regards,    Eugenio 
beck-s	 Attached is the spreadsheet requested that consolidates common findings in  London across commodities.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments. 
beck-s	 Due to the 4th of July holiday, we have an unusual quarter-end situation on  our hands.   Here are some of the facts:  Enron in Houston is closed on both Monday and Tuesday, July 3rd and 4th.   The NYMEX is closed both days as well.   Equity markets are closed on Tuesday, July 4th but are open on Monday, July  3rd.   Enron Europe is open for business on both days. Technically, the first work day following the month-end is Wednesday, July  5th for the Houston office.  Given the facts above, the following will be the month-end process:  QUARTER-END PROCESS: Final quarter-end information is due to my team by 5 PM on Wednesday, July  5th.   No adjustments < $250,000 will be processed after 5 PM on Wednesday. Adjustments > $250,000 require approval from John Lavorato or John Sherriff. A final DPR for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 will be issued by  approximately noon on Thursday, July 6.  JULY DPR REPORTING: NO DPR will be issued dated July 3, 2000. For divisions reporting P&L for July 3rd and/or July 4th, a "Special DPR"  will be issued on July 5th.  This "Special DPR" will not have a year-to-date  column.  This is due to the fact that quarter-end information will not be  completed prior to issuing the "Special DPR".    For consolidated DPR  purposes, July 3rd and July 4th will be combined and reported as one day.   These combined days will be reported as July 4th.  Please report each of  these days separately.  Once the final quarter-end DPR is completed, the  regular DPRs for July business will be updated and reported, replacing any  "Special DPRs" previously reported.  This process is necessary to enable  reporting of current daily information until the final quarter-end DPR is  finalized.  Please contact me at extension 35242 or Chris Abel at extension 33102 if you  have any questions.  As always, your cooperation in executing this month-end  process is greatly appreciated

beck-s	 Tonight Kris and I met with the SAP team about the critical issues we  discussed in the meeting this morning.    As far as Xref1 (coordinator) and Xref2 (physical vs. financial flag) fields  go, it appears that we are getting what we have to have in order to go live  7/1.  Rena was working on a spec (the OSS that was discussed) that would  automatically populate these 2 fields.  However, the test was unsuccessful.   These two fields are being opened up for netting, so we can input them  manually when netting.  I believe we need to pursue the auto fill post 7/1,  but the first priority is having a place to put the data.  As far as settlement period is concerned, we are probably going to get a  hybrid of what we want at this time.  The SAP team does appear to have  appropriate resources working on this issue.  For data created in SAP, I am  more comfortable that the data is being captured on the income statement side  of the entry, and the SAP folks now seem to think they can link over to it to  get the settlement data.  For data converted, we will not be able to get the  settlement period in the same manner.  The offsetting entry in conversion is  to a dummy conversion account rather than an income statement account.  The  dummy account doesn't carry the settlement date.  Another issue is related to  the indicator to let us know if an invoice has had cash applied or

beck-s	 With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees  between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to  have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee  data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the  year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC  requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their  profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education  need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is  accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to  hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com  on the command line of your browser.  The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would  like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned  for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please  contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.    Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Sally Beck is setting up a meeting  with Mark Taylor to discuss concerns. #2 - Segregation of commercial/non-commercial support functions - COMPLETED.   Risk has set up a separate Excel spreadsheet to verify to trader's. #3 - Enpower global data is currently being populated for Calgary.  We have  requested access to the Enpower test database, and will proceed with testing  once we finish populating the global data (2 - 3 weeks). #4 - Term transactions bridging to Sitara - need an update from Beth Perlman.  #5 - Reporting unhedged currency risk - COMPLETED.  Our net currency position  is now being sent to the Controls group in Houston each day as of June 26th. #6 - Managing FX risk in various trading portfolios - progress continues - an  offer to hire a currency trader will be sent out on June 27th.  This person  will be responsible for the resolution of this  issue. #7 - Provide info on gas exotic & power data ;  The power information is  being provided to the controls group in the requested format.  Once we  receive confirmation that the information is being pulled in correctly, we  will proceed with populating the templates for the gas exotics.  This will be  completed by June 30th.  I will be out of the office the rest of this week.  If you need clarification  on any of these items, you can page me at 716-2808.

How do you see this being implemented to best assure it is respected? Legal Standards are absent?  I suspect this is still in draft form and they  are to follow in the next version; however, let me know how you see legal  Standards playing into this as I believe they should be on this list as well.  As discussed, I strongly believe that a brief and clear list of "absolutes"  similar to the attachment will be most useful if first agreed by all that  need to be involved and then effectively communicated and respected by all in  EEL.  Let me know if this list is now considered representative of the views  of all that need to have input.  I suggest we meet again with a broader group  to assure this list is complete and to discuss next steps.  I have some  suggested adjustments but will get back to you by end of week with comments  or questions from RAC after we discuss this in our weekly RAC manager's  meeting.

beck-s	 As you are painfully aware, we had a power outage Wednesday morning in the  Enron Building.  This outage was caused by localized structural failure of  the raised floor in our 34th floor Data Center.  This resulted in disruption  to the power distribution system servicing the phone switch and a number of  ENA servers.  As a cautionary move, Enron OnLine was interrupted while the extent of the  failure was assessed, resulting in the system being unavailable from 11:23 to  11:39.  All Enron Building telephones and voicemail were unavailable for  approximately one hour and 20 minutes and certain ENA trading systems were  unavailable for over two hours.  During this time the power was stabilized  and systems were restored.  Immediate steps are being taken to correct this  problem.   We apologize for this inconvenience.  If you have any questions in regard to this outage, please call Philippe Bibi  at x37698 or Bill Donovan at x35459

I did not hear any negative comments, and they even said they liked it better  than SIFT.  Some of the key areas in which they see great benefit are:  1.  the automatic calculation of in and out of the money options 2.  the statement group assignment screen and the idea of selecting different  statement groups for different payment terms 3.  the ability to sort and subtotal on financial list screen  4.  the system is more efficient than SIFT 5.  the ability to view the invoice on screeen and to click directly on the  line to make adjustments 6.  the ability to wire foreign currencies (really and SAP enhancement)  One thing that I did hear is that they wished they could see Enron North  America AND ENA Global together on the financial list screen.   I think the development group did a great job, and I enjoyed working with  everyone.  I hope that in the next few weeks and months ahead that you will  continue to allow the team to provide our group with quick and efficient  response to areas of concern and enhancements.  Thank you to the group for all of your hard work, Becky

Without going into a  lot of detail regarding the events, the modification desired is simply an  Expiration Date field for certain types of transactions (Swaptions), where a  date is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into TAGG.  In  addition, this feature will permit TAGG to prompt the user or users with a  message box of the Expiration date and associated Deal Number at a later  time, before the expiration date becomes current (i.e. a week before the  expiration date becomes current).    This request carries a lot of value for it allows ENA to avoid a variety of  risks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades.  This issue  was addressed in the past and I would like to raise it again.  Can we implement such modification? Your prompt response is highly needed and  your feedback is appreciated.    Thanks.

beck-s	 I just looked over your draft of the fundamental operating standards again.   I think they are very good and I am just worried about completeness (what are  we missing).  One thing that occurs to me is logistics and somehow  reconciling planned physical activity to scheduled activity to actual  recorded and settled activity.  Is this covered somehow??  Hope all is well. 
beck-s	 Brent,   As I have indicated to both Sally and Beth, this couldn't have been  accomplished without the solid partnership with the business and  participation by key individuals from your team.   Specifically, Jeff Sorensen, Bob Klein, Becky Ford, Laurel Adams and Melissa  White were key to making this work. This was a 'come from behind' effort and  there were many nights and weekends that this team shared pizza while  debugging SAP and Financials system issues. This type of partnership and  commitment is required for success in these types of projects.   Kudos to the team for the on-time delivery.

beck-s	 There are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening  on the integration of the MG metals business and a large number of fluid  teams working on different aspects of the project; however, most issues  related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of  the people involved.  We currently have two main forums for information sharing available to  members of the integration team:  The weekly newsletter produced by Fiona Grant in PR, which from 30 June  onwards will be sent to EEL management and the heads of those departments  represented on the Integration Team. A weekly meeting on Friday mornings from 8am to 9am in NW1006, which has been  put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire  integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and/or coming  week.    For now, I expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the  information needs of the integration team.  If you feel this is not adequate,  then let either myself or Fiona Grant know and we'll do a re-think on the  subject.  To this end, and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion  in the allotted time, the following are a few organisational points I would  like everyone to bear in mind when attending the Friday morning meeting:  Attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly  meeting.  Presenters should attend if at all possible and, in the event they are unable  to attend, should nominate a replacement for the meeting (replacements should  be notified to Esther Gerratt in advance of the  Friday morning meeting if  possible).  For the time being, presenters and their designated areas are:  - Eric Gadd  Commercial and Acquisition progress - Amita Gosalia  EOL - Justin Boyd  Legal - Toby Knight  Premises - Barry Sangster  IT infrastructure - Bob Campbell  IT applications - Richard Sage  Middle and Back Offices and Project Management - Lloyd Fleming  RAC - Tim Davies  Credit - Anne Edgley  Finance - Anne Hicks  Cash Management - Janine Juggins  Tax - Andrea Kerch  US GAAP and Due diligence - Nigel Sellens  HR - Fiona Grant  PR - Bruce Garner  Business Development    As  this is intended to be an "update"-only meeting, any unresolved  substantive issues are to be taken off-line and the resolution reported the  following week.  Lastly, I would request that presenters focus on communicating, in an  efficient manner, things which affect other functions within the integration  process.  Doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information  presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas.  I hope you find this useful.   We want to keep the information flowing as we  continue the integration process, but at the same time we need to make sure  we use our time wisely and efficiently.  Regards, Eric 
beck-s	 In order  to improve efficiency and segregation of duties within  International Global Products, a new Coordination team is being created in  London to take on the Control functions currently performed within the  Logistics team.  This will allow the Commercial Logistics team to concentrate on improving the  bottom line results by negotiations and arrangements with outside parties.  The Commercial Logistics team (Europe) headed by Graham Cane will now report  to Chris Mahoney.  The Coordination function has been set up by Cindy Horn, who will be handing  over the leadership to Becky Millerchip on following the implementation of  SAP for Global Products. This team will handle all paperwork and  reconciliations with regard to product movements of Global Products generated  by the London and Helsinki offices, and the further processing of this  information to the systems and users downstream.   The Coordination function for Houston and Panama City will be headed by  Michelle Bruce, with the Logistics team headed by John Harrison now reporting  directly to John Nowlan.  Michelle will build her team during the third  quarter.  A similar rationalisation of roles in the Far Eastern offices will be  announced in due course.  Please join us in congratulating Graham and Becky, Michelle and John  on  their new responsibilities, and in thanking Cindy for her hard work in making  this happen.     Tani Nath & John Nowlan

Please read  All,  July 1, SAP goes into effect for us here in Houston.  Also, the seller rules  principle comes into play.  This means that if we (the IR/FX desk) owe you a  payment in USD, GBP or EUR, you MUST book the payable in SAP to company 0967  (we are no longer company 1Y3).  We then go into SAP and remove the block and  that allows the payment to be sent.    Per Corp., all intercompany trades are to be handled in this  manner.  This  means that when you are paying us any of the 3 above currencies, we will go  into SAP and book a payable to your company.  Going forward, when confirming  settlements with Ana, you must be prepared to provide her with your company  number.  You are then responsible for going into SAP and removing the block  to allow payments to be released.    Is SIFT UK interfacing directly to SAP, or will you manually be booking these  entries?  If you are interfacing, the payable entry should automatically be  created.  If you are  manually booking into SAP, you will need to coordinate  with your accounting/reporting contacts to make sure that all of this goes  smoothly.  If you are not the person who will be manually booking the entries  into SAP, please forward this message to the appropriate person.

beck-s	 Discussions over the last several days with legal and tax have resulted in a  change to the legal entity we'll use for the "trading" portion of  Clickpaper.com activity.    As long as our business model is a one to many model the decision is...... a. For Click Match activity Clickpaper.com can still be used as planned.   Simply, we'll only be invoicing for transaction fees. b. For Click Trade activity the following will happen.  1.  Physical trading that occurs at any North American Hub developed by  Clickpaper.com, Enron North America, Corp. (ENA) will be the         confirming entity.  I  have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement  for the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as  a         "Clickpaper.com on-line transaction".     2.  Physical trading that occurs at any Hub developed for the U.K., Latin  America, or Asia, has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes.  My  desire is       that we follow the legal entity structure used by EOL on-line  trading for Hubs in similar countries.  We'll work that out soon.  Strictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most  significant is a much simplified mid/back-office effort in order to support  Clickpaper on-line business.  We no longer need to be concerned about setting  up more portfolio/book i.d.'s for risk books as on-line deals can go into the  same risk books used today for pulp and paper.  Intercompany transactions  between Clickpaper.com and ENA are now eliminated for on-line trades which  simplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial  reporting/reconcilation activity that would be required by using  Clickpaper.com as the entity.    If our one to many model is successful, we move to a many to many model.  At  that point, all of this changes.  So for now, ENJOY!  For now,  Jeff Harbert 
beck-s	 I attach below a one page summary of control standards which are believed to  be fundamental. This summary, produced as a result of the Doorstep review,  could be a 'yardstick' to benchmark our businesses - ie an aid to  communication between Commercial, Commercial Support and RAC re the level of  Operating Risk within each business and the region as a whole. Consequently  it would be complimentary to the BRM process.    I hope to complete an efficient/judgemental assessment internally for all  businesses in conjunction with RAC and present the findings to yourselves (  and /or your desk managers ) within the next week/10 days. The aim would also  be to establish that the currrent action plans for Systems Development and  Support resource allocation is appropriate. The assessment would be based on  a traffic light scale ie  Green inherent risk less processes/controls gives a residual operational risk  which is accpetable  Amber  - watch out - residual operational risk is high and/or control trend  is decreasing  Red - stop now we have problem ( Helsinki equivalent ! )  Upon completion of the assessment I will book some time in your diaries  Regards  Mike

beck-s	 Hi.  To complete our discussion on the  manual monitoring & also to clarify,  see below.  Greg Whiting will call ENA whenever he enters more than a specified number of  changes in the SAP T880 table. He will transition this procedure to the SAP  COE.  What is the threshold that Global needs to be notified?  Who in Global  should be notified?  To clarify, the verification is manual & is subject to human error, such as  someone forgets or is on vacation.  If a large file is sent without  notification during the day, the impact is significant.  I think moving the  job to run in the evening will virtually eliminate the potential for this  problem to occur again.  However, to eliminate the risk completely I suggest  that the verification be automated.  You said that you'll have the ability to  do this in global in a few months.  If you can't do it, then we (SAP) need to  write an automated monitoring program.

The mass update from SAP to Global/ Unify effected Enron's business  throughout the afternoon, causing contract replication to be delayed, and  missed nominations.  Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur again: Global Replication - Move the SAP to Global/ Unify replication for  Intercompany from hourly to a nightly (1:00 am) process.  As we could miss  new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced. SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled  'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak  time.

beck-s	 The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the  power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the  message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months  now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday  (Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and  should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six  times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by  4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a  state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders  by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on  our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution  of this problem. Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower  and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.   I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing  business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the  agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense  or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to  another server. Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

We run one of our three east power  calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution  for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken  away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We  usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5  hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful  completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building  when the calc crashes at 4:30. Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the  last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable. We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our  system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense  of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden  today about these problems.  I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted  with the finger pointing between different IT groups. Thanks.

beck-s	 Japan's Electricity Newspaper ("Denki Shimbun", the equivalent of Megawatt  Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several  of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran  across one on Enron that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I  thought you would find it interesting.  The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by  being first to meet our clients' changing needs.  It also describes how we  use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.   The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.  The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is  about Enron.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese  are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.  Denki Shimbun also has a web site at "www.shimbun.denki.or.jp".  They have  small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is  completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is  "www.criepi.denken.or.jp", the English home site of Japan's Central Research  Institute of Electric Power Industry (Denryoku Chuo Kenkyuujou).

Settlements clerk will prepare invoices.   Invoices will be approved by Risk Book Admin. (Paul/Allan) and Heidi   Paul and Allan will have a direct line to Heidi and a dotted line to  myself.  Apparently there is some concern voiced by both  of these guys regarding additional risk related opportunities elsewhere in  the company.

So, what=01,s happening?  1) Status of Acquisition :  two days ago Enron reached a key threshold of 90% acceptances for our=20 previously announced "conditional" cash offer.  under take-over rules, this means that we can now nominate the date from=20 which our offer goes "unconditional" and from which we will have "effective= =20 control" - for legal, tax and treasury reasons that date will probably be= =20 sometime during the week 17th-21st July.  the "effective control" date should not be confused with the date from whic= h=20 MG plc results will be "consolidated" with those of Enron Europe - for=20 practical reasons we actually have some discretion which date we chose to= =20 consolidate from, within the range 1st July to 1st August.  various groups of Enron personnel are engaged in the integration effort and= =20 Richard Sage is co-ordinating on behalf of Fernley Dyson - the reason I am= =20 sending out this bulletin is that Mike has asked me to co-ordinate the=20 integration of the Middle Office!   2) This Week  EnronOnline initiative - coincidently, at around the same time that Enron= =20 launched EOL, MG launched their own internet trading platform for base meta= l=20 products. There has been a lot of discussion about how we move MG's interne= t=20 based business over to EnronOnline in order to be able to offer our=20 burgeoning EOL client base a fuller range of products. However, as a first= =20 step this week we launched three new base metals products, not previously= =20 traded by MG, on EnronOnline and so on Monday we did our first base metals= =20 trades!=20  using the "Doorstep" format, Brent Price is leading a controls review to he= lp=20 us assess operational risks, and generally focus on the areas that we need = to=20 think about as we get nearer to consolidating MG's business with our own.  a detailed valuation review was kicked-off yesterday to ensure that MG's=20 valuation and reserving methodology is consistent with our own.  today a project team is being assembled to figure out how to migrate MG to= =20 SAP. Given our experience of 1st October and 1st July go-lives this should = be=20 a piece of cake!!   3)  Next Week  on Monday we will be presenting the Enron Model to MG to help them understa= nd=20 where we are coming from! This will involve stepping them through our=20 definition of Roles & Responsibilities for each of the functional groups th= at=20 make up the front, middle and back office, and introduce them to the variou= s=20 Enron people who will be responsible for helping MG to transition to this= =20 model over the coming months.   4) Out there somewhere...  The plan is still to move the entire London based MG business into Enron=20 House in mid-September though we may find some MG staff joining us before= =20 then.

beck-s	 John,  As of Wednesday, we have a resource from Sun Microsystems that is helping  us  isolate the problems we're having with the UNIX operating system and our  code.  This resource has requested that we bring on an additional application  specialist from SUN.  This has been authorized and the additional resource is  scheduled to be on site next week.  I also have my resources and the UNIX  administrators working along side the Sun resources.  As an aside, we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side  of the business.  I met with Sally Beck's controllers yesterday and we are  putting a plan in place.  The increased trading volumes have seriously  impacted our through put and we now have a 'blitz' on to correct the issues.  These problems have not gone unnoticed.  I assure you that IT has been very  diligent in following through on these problems.  We're investing heavily in  additional hardware, bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources  at an average of 5 - 8 per week.  I will keep you posted as we continue to  enhance our existing systems.

How can we be the most Innovative  Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.   Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our  power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management,  settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.  In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because  they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on "holidays".  This  whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt  with accordingly.  Please advise.

We run one of our three east power  calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution  for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken  away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We  usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5  hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful  completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building  when the calc crashes at 4:30. Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the  last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable. We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our  system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense  of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden  today about these problems.  I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted  with the finger pointing between different IT groups. Thanks.

I would contact  Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.

beck-s	 Dear all,  As you know, we will be hosting staff from MG tomorrow evening and on  Wednesday and Thursday evening for a presentation/overview on Enron and a  tour of Enron House.  The MG Staff have not been selected by department for  these events, but rather have been given the option to sign up on a  first-come, first-serve basis.  I anticipate having approximately 35 people  on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday and 35 on Thursday.  The members of MG's  management who joined us on the 8th of June are not attending this week in  order to provide their colleagues with an opportunity to visit the building  (hence the smaller numbers).  The purpose of these events is to help MG staff get better acquainted with  Enron and to see first-hand where they will be relocating to in September.   To this end, I would like to invite all of you to attend at least one of  three events with a view to being on hand to act as a host/hostess,  potentially join tours of the building and to be on hand to field any  specific questions which may come up about your respective departments.  I  hope this will also prove to be a good opportunity for you to meet MG staff  on a more informal basis.    The schedule of events each night will be as follows:   17:45 - 18:00  MG Staff Arrive at Enron House  18:00 - 18:05  Welcome and Introductions:  Eric Gadd  18:05 - 18:15  Enron Video  18:15 - 18:40  Presentation on Enron and Enron Europe: Mark Schroeder  (Tuesday)          Fernley Dyson (Wednesday)          John Thompson (Thursday)  18:40 - 19:30   Tours of Enron House/Drinks & Canap,s  19:30 - 19:45  Depart for Home by Bus to Liverpool Street Station [or  Directly from Enron House]   I know that many of you have been keen to participate in this kind of  informal event with our new colleagues at MG, so I hope you will be able to  join us.   So that we can get a feel for numbers, I would appreciate it if  you could RSVP to me by 2:00 p.m. tomorrow regarding your participation for  all three events.  Please note that due to a number of Enron staff  participating in the Chase Corporate Challenge on Wednesday evening, I am  very short on "tour guides".  So, if you can make it on Wednesday evening and  if you feel up to it, please advise if you can lead a tour of the building (a  map and cheat sheet will be provided!!).  Regards, Fiona

beck-s	 I had a meeting today with Milind Laad (Financial Controller), Anand S.  (Manager - Accounts) and Heidi Hellman (commercial associate & person  responsible for setting up the mid & back office functions) from the Indian  office in regards to their expected Coal, Power, liquid fuels, and gas  transactions.  We based the discussion around the checklist (copy attached  below).  The following is a summary of the meeting.  India is in the process of looking at potential deals but has not signed any  contracts yet.  Heidi and Milind believe that in the near term India will  only be doing a few structured deals and no trading.   Heidi, Milind and I went over the checklist together and the results indicate  that there is still a lot to do before India commences activities.  They have  talked to a number of people about their plans but have not formalized  anything as of yet.  Also, I'm not sure they yet appreciate the number of  processes and procedures that must be established before any transactions  have commenced.   I politely told Milind that the Enron way is to have systems, processes,  procedures and controls established before any deals have commenced and that  we have to make sure this happens.  Lastly, there are certain things that  they told me that I'm a bit worried about (the first is that a commercial  person is responsible for setting up controls and processes).  I would like  to talk to each about some of these as well as about what involvement you  have had with India to date and what involvement you may have on an ongoing  basis.  Regards  Shona

beck-s	 Since I had to leave before the meeting concluded and you were not there at  that point, I wanted to recap my understanding of the next steps.  Ed  Gottlob, Melissa Graves, Rita Wynne and Clem Cernosek will work together to  pull data to view HPLC's total transport business, and then balance it to the  off-system interconnect business used in the Texas Trading Operation.  This  perspective, when all elements are accounted for and tied out, should result  in the accounting UA4 numbers recorded each month in our general ledger.   They will focus as the core team, and will enlist others as needed which  might include Gas Accounting, Settlements (Lisa Csikos) or others.   Additionally, Johnnie has offered assistance from her team, but feels the  project of tieing the data best resides in Energy Operations.  They will need  to determine their course of action, and schedule a follow-up meeting with  the group when they have some data to share.  I want to reiterate:  We all understand the importance of this project and  will do everything possible to support it.  These 4 people will remove  themselves from their daily activities to concentrate on this full-time.  We  felt a dedicated group would deliver the desired results more effectively  rather than individuals balancing other responsiblities.  It is crucial that  everyone take ownership in the results.  Please let me know if I have misstated anything or if there are any questions.  Brenda x3-5778

Mark Taylor with ENA Legal  said yesterday  that the law signed by President Clinton in June regarding electronic  signatures should allow us to eliminate confirmations for Enron OnLine transactions.  The law, in short,  gives electronic signatures the legal weight of paper signatures and goes into effect October 1, 2000.  Until we receive final approval, we will have to simply hope and pray that  this becomes reality.  However,  even if this becomes reality, we will continue to have Counterparties that  will require confirmations such  as the public utilities.  I will keep you updated. 
beck-s	 Dear Sally,  Since we may not be able to have our bi-weekly meeting, I thought I'd let you  know what's going on:  DPR I'm working with London to determine how to report the MG DPR to us.  Nothing  has been decided yet as we are waiting on the risk management policies & risk  limits from our guys in London. As you know, plenty of V@R questions have been coming our way, and are  somewhat difficult for Mike's team to answer.  I talked with Eugenio and he  is in the process of putting together some V@R analytics/graphs Mike's guys  can easily create to answer simpler V@R questions. Burton, a book analyst in Brent's group is coming back to Mike's DPR group to  support Gary Stadler and work on the benchmark reports and curve  validations.  Jenifer Bagwell has taken Burton's place in Brent's group.  A while back, Eugenio created a database to capture information and allows  book & commodity analysis.  He has been showing this to Business Unit  controllers & the RAC group, but has not distributed it yet, due to security  issues.  Currently, the database does not restrict different users to  different commodities (power people can see gas and vice versa).  It will  slow down the database considerably if these restrictions are put in, but it  may be necessary.  I think the business controllers would not share the  information with commercial, but I'm not sure about the analysts in the RAC  group.  I'd like to get your opinion on this.  Doorstep I've updated the presentation to include places and planned visits for  offices previously not visited and second offices visits for the next year Donna, Ted, Richard L. and I have a meeting scheduled to go over the follow  up of the first visits - I'll update you after the meeting.  Hope you had a good vacation!  Regards

beck-s	 We have scheduled a user test for Clickpaper on Saturday, July 22nd starting  at 8:30 AM on the 29th floor of the Enron building.    First, a reminder to Edward and Bob to make sure the ENA Paper group is here  (commercial only plus, at a minimum, John Jacobson).  It is up to Edward and  Bob to decide if London personnel should be here but I would recommend a  few.  They will be the "users" in the test.  We will have a script for them.   The goal is to test the site and the capability of the trading floor.  I will  explain more about this to Edward and Bob next week.  Also, Bill Bradford or his designee from credit needs to be here to review  the functionality of the credit check.  Also, Ted Murphy or his designee  needs to be here to review control.  If the test is a success, we will wipe the system clean Saturday and will  create actual customer profiles we have received in the system on Sunday.   Monday we will review everything one last time for Tuesday launch, July 25th  launch.  We will provide lunch for everyone so get to me the names of who is committed  so I can plan.  Please respond with any issues or questions.  Thanks.  GP 
beck-s	 I left you a couple of messages last week regarding the trip, and since I am  here, I don't know if we will get a chance to actually talk to each other  today (especially since it is your first day back in the office), so I want  to give you the details in case you get a call from Louise.  I know you and I talked about the trip, and that the entire team was going to  go to London for team building in smaller groups of 4-5 people.  I did not  think it right that everyone in the group go and Cecilia not be included.   There is a business reason for her to be here, as she is working on the PCG  Operations Manual (it is very outdated and needs revising).  The team in  Houston has made edits, so she will be editing and reviewing the doc with the  London team for their changes while we are here.    I was also told that it was Enron policy that employees fly business class on  International flights.  Louise stated that Sheriff does not want people  flying business class, but I was not aware of this.  For future trips,  everyone will fly coach.  I also have Cecilia rooming with Melba to save  costs on the trip, and others will do the same on future trips if necessary.   I told Dave about a month ago that we were going at this time, which he does  not remember...Dave made the comment to me that he feels like he is more  aware of what is going on in London than in Houston and that he and Amita  spend at least an hour or two on the phone each day, and that maybe I need to  report to him instead of you.  I really do not have time to spend 2 hours out  of my day updating him on every little thing that the group does.  I do make  him aware of issue/questions, but I think this is overkill.  I told him it  does make sense for me to report to you b/c we support ongoing operations of  EnronOnline and are closely linked to the groups that fall beneath your  organization.  As you can see, I am a little more than frustrated with all this.  I have set  up weekly meeting with Forester going forward, but I really feel like I  should be able to run the group without doing much more than this.  My  decision making should be trusted and I think it has been proven in the  past.  Even when I do ask Dave questions and we try to get information from  him, he is slow to respond b/c he is so involved in so many things and he  becomes a bottleneck of sorts.  I do not want my job to become the person  that just tells Dave what my group is doing.  If they (Dave and Louise) do  not feel like I am capable of running the group or doing a good job, I really  would like to know....  If you do get a chance to call me, please do.  I can be reached at 83035378  here in London.  I tried to send most of this via e-mail b/c I am in the  middle of everyone here and don't know how much I will be able to talk.    Thanks Sheri  
beck-s	 since I will be out tomorrow for our meeting, I thought I would send this on  to you.  I have added explanations in red for you.  Sheri ---------------------- Forwarded by Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT on 07/17/2000 11:04  AM ---------------------------       From:  Sheri Thomas                                                              07/17/2000 05:04 AM	 	 	 	                            	  To: David Forster/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:   Subject: update  Just a couple of things, since we will not be able to meet this week.  The auditors have started review no. 2 of the management report.  I imagine  it will take them at least a couple of weeks  per Louise's request, the  auditors are re-reviewing the management report to ensure that all the  changes were made and the report is now accurate I think you are aware of all the new products Dale is working on (!!!) we  have several things in the works right now, the primary ones being a park and  loan agreement that will be managed out of Chicago, and reliable power Lots and lots of ad hoc reporting (see my earlier e-mail regarding timing of  these reports - we need a decision quickly - this is taking up most of Matt's  time, and with the additional reports requested, it will take up the rest of  it)  I have been sending you the weekly reports we are doing to John and  Jeff.  Louise asked that we provide similar reports for Europe.  We are  starting this week on these We really need to push the profiles manager application - we are getting  swamped with all the new customers and products (Frank was to talk to Mark D.  on Friday - I should have an update from him today)  this new application  will save a ton of manual work - this is something we started as soon as I  took over the group, and also was one of the auditors comments.  Currently,  we are manually entering profiles directly into EOL.  This application we  requested will allow each of the depts (Credit, Global and Legal) to enter  their own profiles into EOL, and we will just become the reviewer of the data  via daily reporting.  The application has been tested, but due to the fact  that the IT group is so busy, we have been placed on the back-burner.  I am  going to turn up the heat on this b/c we are getting overloaded. New reporting application - we are in the process of testing now.   It will  probably be at least a month before it is completed.  This is our new Oracle  application that will replace the Access report Euginio built Torrey will be attending the 8am meeting for me in the morning and will send  me notes  this is the weekly marketing/phase 2 meeting I am currently reviewing the latest version of the price posting agreement to  determine what our roles will be once we are posting prices on the other  platforms (looks like most of it will fall in Dale's world)  You probably saw  the announcement that we are going to post prices on other websites  (HoustonStreet and True Quote) that was made on Thursday last week.   Basically, we have 90 days to make this happen.  IT will build the link to  these other sites, and we will need to ensure that price are reflected  properly and that product long and short descriptions are accurate.  I have  read about 25% of the agreement thus far and am developing a list of  questions and concerns surrounding this. We still are not including the proper weather valuation in the management  report - the numbers are not going to be significant, but we need to report  this appropriately asap.  Any decision here?  We have been working with the  weather risk groups to determine how to appropriately value the weather  transactions.  About a month ago, we reached an agreement with them and have  been waiting on Dave's approval to change the valuation ever since.   Keith has made some suggestions on how we can improve the Remedy application  - I am reviewing while I am here  This is the application that the call  center uses to track issues I will send you the suggestions Stephanie has for improving the new security  application - she will document these for me today  A new SRRS system is in  place via the Intranet.   stuff for you - Carrie S. will begin her 6 month assignment now.  She will be in Australia  for 3 weeks to assist Justin (the PCG person in the Pacific), then to London  for a month to work with Amita, and the duration will be spent working with  the London EOL Marketing team Justin just completed 3 weeks of training on EOL and EOL applications.  I  think he will do an excellent job - I was very impressed with his questions  and how quickly he picked things up.   Just send me any questions you have -  Thanks Sheri

beck-s	 Sally,  I'm sorry I left you off my original note but I wanted you to know...... Dianne    ...the third time is a charm.  After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me  with a beautiful daughter!  Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 11:18  am in San Antonio.  She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.  She is so  tiny and has a head full of dark hair!  I brought her home last night at 8:30  pm.  Our first  night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.  It's going to take some time  for me to get used to the noises she makes.  I must admit, there were days when I never thought this would happen.  I appreciate all the kind words  of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years as I have gone through this process, especially during the really low  points.  I am truly blessed. I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm  sure I'll be logging in often.  Also, if I left someone off the list here,  please have them forgive me.  Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.  Please feel  free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.  Thanks. Dianne 
beck-s	 Just so you can see where my paycheck now goes.  What a great way to spend  money! djs   Here are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6  days old.  She brings me joy I never thought possible.  And I'm sure some day  she'll bring me some pain, but I'm not thinking about that right now.  I  didn't know how easy it was to fall in love.  I am a different person  (better) because of her.   Yesterday, we made our first trip to the pediatrician and he said that she  was doing fine.  She gained  7 ounces!  She's quite a good little eater.  We  are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it  gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We'll probably make a trip down  to the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I  hope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.  Here's the pictures.....(by  the way, the blonde at the hospital with me is my youngest sister, Kerri) 
beck-s	 Sally - Per our conversation, attached is the list of questions that Peoples  Energy Risk Management personnel have prepared regarding the risk management  policy and operating procedures of the Chicago Office.  There is a meeting  scheduled for next Wednesday from 1-4 with Peoples to discuss these  questions.  Vlady Gorny and Ted Murphy are scheduled to be in attendance.  At  this time, I am expecting that the ground rules for the meeting will be that  Peoples has the right to ask any question and Enron reserves the right to not  answer any specific items that are proprietary/confidential and respond only  in terms of a general framework.  We will then discuss alternatives for  satisfying their needs such as independent audit.  Thanks for your assistance  in reviewing this list and providing feedback.  If you could also let me know  your schedule, along with whoever will be able to attend the meeting, over  the next few days I will get an internal meeting setup to discuss these  issues prior to Wednesday.  Thanks,  Gregg 312-541-1229 
beck-s	 Sally,  Per your request, here is a copy of my resume.  The information is updated  through my role in investor relations which accounts for the review period.

beck-s	 We have a new date - Monday, July 24th beginning at 9:00 am.  I will contact  your supervisors after the PRC meeting to let them know the final results.   Your supervisor will give your performance review and will be able to  summarize the feedback received through the PEP system during the review.    Thanks for providing your resumes.  I will feel more informed during the  process.    
beck-s	 Please notate on your calendar:  The room location for the Associate PRC at the Hyatt will Arboretum 4 and 5  rather than Arboretum 1 and 2.  Thank you for your participation. 
beck-s	 Hi Sally, Unfortunately I was out of the office for the latter part of last week and  was unable to get back to you with my resume.  Please find it attached.  I  understand the PRC meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow, hopefully you  will get it in time. Federico told me that you met with him last week.  I want to thank you very  much for taking the time to familiarize yourself with my background and  accomplishments.  Undoubtedly this is a challenging and time-consuming  process, adding to your current responsibilities.   I would like to wish you luck at the PRC meeting tomorrow, hopefully it won't  run as long as that of the Analysts.

Both the morning  Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the  same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is  apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to  cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as  soon as I know a rescheduled date.    In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with  most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities,  accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a  meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to  accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have  provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as  copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.    With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of  your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance  specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to  me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please  e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you  have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name  and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in  Houston.  My extension is 35926.

beck-s	 Dear Bill,  I am currently helping Milind Laad and Heidi Hellman establish a risk  operations department for the India trading company.  I was wondering if you  would have 10 minutes to meet with me sometime this week to discuss how you  see India moving forward and in what time frame as this would help me a great  deal in determining what types of systems, processes, and controls we should  set up.  Thanks,  Shona

In order to address him, I create a reply or new  message and then click on the Address button. Change the address book from  ECT or Enron to the ECT External Address Book:    At this point I need to skip down to the Jones' in the list, so I just type  jones and a Quick Search dialogue box appears. Click OK and I go to the first  of the Jones' llisted in this address book (Allan I think). It's a reasonably  long list, but only one exists.    He's Tim R Jones, so I click on the 'To:' button to add him to the recipient  list for the message.    This is a good procedure to pass on to others.

beck-s	 Clickpaper is now on the web with transactable prices.    At 8:30 AM Tuesday the 25th, we did our first trade, a 42# linerboard trade  (the outside part of a cardboard box) with Con Agra (13,500 tons and about  $6,000,000 notional).  We hope to do another trade today with Irving as well.  I am sure we will have a new list of bugs at the end of today but I think we  are past the major issues.  Going forward (next two to three weeks), we will be working to get the  product offering from its current 21 financial to about 50 financial as well  as adding in physical at Rotterdam.  We will also be ready to handle any  newsprint from Garden State at the end of August.  We also have some text  changes and minor programming related to  wording on the site that is new or  unclear to the industry.  We will continue to push for registration (currently at 12 who now have user  ID, password and made it through credit, legal, tax).  The markets load in about 4 seconds now so we fixed the slowness issue.  We will also start generating a report each day on stats that are relevant.  I will try to get some read only IDs for people but give me a little time to  get this done.  I want my tech people sitting with the traders this week  showing them the system and making sure everything is working. They also need  to go back through what they did the last month and make sure they clean up  some steps.  We will work on a press release to maybe go out mid to late August to  coincide with a larger customer mailing, a few adds in industry publications,  physical product and a complete suite of financial products.   I would like to thank everyone who helped us get to this launched  successfully.  However, we all realize this is a beginning, not an ending,  and that there is a significant amount of work still ahead.  Thanks.  GP

beck-s	 Sally, I've confirmed with the training company the two dates - 14/15th September,  and 21/22 September. The room will be EB 560, so there are no external venue costs to take into  account.  I'll ask Gracie to coordinate with Patti on the details regarding materials  and lists of attendees - and of course we'll keep you in the info loop.  Given that it is for your group only, nearer the time we'll circulate the  agenda and ask the attendees to identify if there are any particular areas of  interest, or specific questions. In  doing so, we will be able to prime the  instructors so that they are able to tailor the direction of the course for  your group.  I am working with Norma Villareal on other hr matters within EOPS, but do let  me know if there's anything specific you need.   regards Tim

beck-s	 The SAP Reporting Team is currently scheduling Reporting Workshops for August  and September.  These will be very focused, hands on, sessions from 1-4 hours  long with around 5 people per session.   There is one overview class, Design  & Data Flow, which will not be hands on but which will give you an overview  of how data flows in the systems.   Each class will focus on how to pull  reports within the specific module listed and how to use the standard SAP  reporting tools.  Please review the list of classes below and provide me with a list of  individuals that you would like to attend each type of session and your first  and second choose of sessions.  It will work better if we can fill an entire  class with people from either the same group or that perform the same  function.  This will help keep the classes focused.  Please provide an  initial list to me by noon Monday July 31st.  I will be out of the office on Thurs. and Friday July 27-28.  I my absence  please feel free to call Kim Lesley at 5-77713.  She will be happy to answer  any questions you may have.     
beck-s	 August 29, 30, 31 You will be receiving more information from Rick and Cindy, but here are the  dates for the offsite Rick and Cindy are hosting to:  Assess what we have accomplished with SAP relative to the original goals  Assess where we are today (new initiatives on the horizon, acquisition  strategy, state of the COE, etc)  Determine strategically where we go next.  For those that participated in either or both of the original ASEs  (Accelerated Solutions Environment, a professionally facilitated,  specially-designed location for rapid, large-group decision making), this  event will be similar in format (not content).  If you have not previously  particpated in an ASE, detailed information will be forthcoming.  The likely location is Dallas (a new ASE has just been opened there).  We MAY  be able to trim this down to two days (not probable, but we are going to  try), but for now please plan on 3 full days (8 am to 7 pm or later).  The above is not the final invitee list (we will likely add a few more  people), but we wanted to geet this on your calendars as soon as we had the  date.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you will or will not be able  to attend, and if there is anyone from your organization that you feel is  critical to achieving the objectives above.  Thank you! 
beck-s	 Interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by Tim -  says a lot about the way MG do business I think.  RE NY we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( Philip  Bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a DASH for each prepayment on a  contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in NY and we may have  some issues - although Marcelo and others stressed the fact that Concentrates  appeared to move no product without a letter of credit, which was then often  discounted to realise cash!!  Shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment  yesterday from Philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were  'unique' - whilst I can accept that each may be tailored to customer  preferences - they still need to be CACSed - we should look at the  enforceability/legal risk here.  Whilst information prepayment risk for Metals should come from London -  accessing any relevent inofrmation from NY may be helpful  Will call later ! ---------------------- Forwarded by Mike Jordan/LON/ECT on 27/07/2000 09:33  ---------------------------   Tim Poullain-Patterson 26/07/2000 21:53 To: Eric Gadd/LON/ECT@ECT, Goran Novakovic/LON/ECT@ECT, Robert  Quick/LON/ECT@ECT, David Hardy/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Justin  Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT, Howard Carter/The Metal & Commodity Co Ltd/MGLTD@MGLTD cc: Richard Sage/LON/ECT@ECT, Diana Higgins/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley  Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Steve W Young/LON/ECT@ECT, Bjorn Hagelmann/HOU/ECT@ECT,  David P Tregar/MGLTD_London/MGLTD@MGLTD   Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure  The situation at present is as follows:  MG have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper  from the Russian Federation on a prepayment basis  all contracts are on a floating price basis (LME less discount)  notional value of each contract is circa $0.5-3mm  prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis, for between 90-95% value  with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents  The issues break down into three broad areas:  1) Commercial  At present Enron does not engage in prepayment activities with Russian  Federation counterparties.  No further prepayments are permitted until RAC have performed a DASH for this  activity. As this is likely to take several weeks Howard will liase with  Commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising  from this suspension. Howard and David Hardy will also take immediate steps  to manage down existing prepayment exposures.  2) Legal  Based on a cursory review of the confirmations by Robert, if we are to  continue this activity Legal need to instructed to perform a full review for  several reasons, including:  the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms,  e.g. pricing date  they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments, and are generally not  constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity.  "Conditions of Purchase" are attached to the confirmations which refer to  English Law, but as they are not always countersigned, under conflict rules  the closest or real connection may be deemed to be Russian law which, in the  absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability.  there are several "open" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are  beyond the delivery period, and which could be considered to have been  discharged by breach. Again the confirmation does not contain adequate  language.  3) Credit/Operational  There are no formal counterparty limits. Nor are prepayment and volumetric  exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis. This information is  necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance, and needs to be  factored into the overall credit monitoring process.  David has requested this information from MG, and will follow up this one off  exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track  exposures based on the methodology developed for Helsinki.   Further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that,  despite the issues identified with contractual terms, there is performance  against the contracts. David is pursuing this from a Credit perspective and  will report back to his group his findings by Friday latest.  The issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to  accelerate a planned review of contract language for all MG's activities in  all jurisdictions. Mike and I will discuss bringing this review forward with  Justin.  Any questions, please call.  Regards, Tim

beck-s	 Sally:   Please take a look at this letter.  We are comfortable with it, but you need  to be as well before it's sent.  Feel free to propose any changes.  Otherwise  you can let it fly.  Brian  _______________________________________   Dear Energy Operations:  As I have reflected upon the accomplishments of this group, I wanted to  express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have  demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.    Although we have done much, we have much yet to do.  Therefore, as we go  forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the  best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are  removed.  To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen  Corporation -- to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will;  to help us understand what we do well and not so well; in essence, to assist  us in acquiring the "necessary tools" and breaking down any "barriers."  SJBC  is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like our to  help on issues like this.  SJBC will meet with members of our group in a  private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns,  ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.  This collective  information (who said what is not disclosed) then is studied by SJBC with the  goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.  Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC  consultant.  Please schedule a time to partcipate at your earliest  opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we  cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it  will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not  received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts  with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and  Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.  Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that, only by  open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  Thank  you.  Sally

Sally rewrote the storyboards and, according to my understanding, it was handed off to Emrul and then Cindy fixed the html pages for the revised content. But on the server we still have the old version of these files.  What is going on with these files? Gerry would you be able to figure out what's happening? Did it get to Emrul? Did it get to Cindy? Did it get posted? Did older versions get copied over the newer versions?  We *need* to get this Topic done for review-- it was due to Linda almost a week ago. Can you please let me know when it's ready for my review and edit, so we can get it out to Linda.  Thanks, Warren

Consequently, Elise and Mike will be able to attend.  More information on  logistics to follow within two weeks.  We will block off hotel rooms, etc. in  the meantime.    As with the last ASE, it's an "all or nothing" proposition.  Because of the  structure of the event, participants must be there from start to finish (no  partial attendance).  We are still trying to get it to 2 days, but worst case  we will set it so that people can fly up Tuesday morning and fly back  Thursday night.  I am looking forward to everyone's participation and input.Thanks!

beck-s	 Most of you are aware that Unify experienced some major performance issues as  we tried to close out the month of July.  Not to go into any details but  there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the  issues we saw on Monday and to a lesser degree on Tuesday.  Almost all of the  issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of Sybase which is  used for Unify's database.  Jeff Johnson and his team are putting together a  plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in  acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for  August.  The short term tactical plans include the following:  Enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the  amount of data grows. Test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of Sybase which will address  some of the issues.  This may also require some hardware changes as to where  we store certain data.  We will also need some user help in stress testing  prior to moving to production. Addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled.   I have been told that we still have transactions going back to Jan of 99 that  have not been finaled or closed out.  This puts quite a load on the PMA and  accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see  what if any action should be taken with these transactions.  Once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little  time to absorb the tremendous growth we've been seeing via EOL  then we will  focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions.  These  include the following:  Rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be  much more scalable. Moving off of Sybase and on to Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.  It will be  easier to move Microsoft SQL Server but we have to be sure it is the right  solution in the long term.  Jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed  plan.  Needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best  people are working on these efforts.  This will slow down major enhancement  efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and  nominations.  We will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical  solutions.  In the mean time feel free to contact me at x-36858 or Jeff at  x-39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail.  Thanks!  -   Tommy 
beck-s	 We had a meeting with Rick Causey today.  He indicated that he would like a  monthly update on the MG integration.  I suggest thaqt we get him a 1-2 page  presentation in mid August.  Regards 
beck-s	 Met today w/ Causey and Sally to discuss Doorstep going forward. Following is  my goal with this process.  Rick Carson will co-ordinate RAC's efforts in  this area pulling in other RAC people as required.   - RAC will participate in review to determine which offices will be inspected  and on what frequency - RAC will help design and participate as required in inspections - I will be able to see, through the RAC website, a list of all offices, a  list of all offices requiring inspection, when an office was inspected,  findings from that inspection and the follow-up from the findings. - If follow up is not happening, a "red flagged" reminder notice should be  issued via email.   This has been a huge effort and we have to have this going forward. This is  one ball that can not be dropped.   Let me know your thoughts if any.  Rick 
beck-s	 In approximately one month (9/9/2000), we are targeting that a new version of  the Oracle NT client (8.1.6), Borland Database Engine (BDE) 5.1.1 and  Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.5. to all Corp/ENA workstations.  This software provides the connectivity from your workstation to Enron's  Oracle databases and the applications supported by them.  We are currently in  the process of testing all the applications managed by Corp/ENA Information  Technology to ensure that they will be compliant with this new software.  This change may also effect your own developed MS-Access, MS-Excel  spreadsheets, and/or MS-Query documents that retrieve data from Enron's  Oracle databases via ODBC drivers. As part of the upgrade, all Oracle ODBC  connections will be upgraded to compliant driver versions.   If you would like to test your MS-Access databases and/or MS-Excel  spreadsheets under the new software releases, please use one of the  workstations at one of the following locations for your testing:  General users EB2230D EB2778B EB0504P EB4857  Traders and developers only please EB2904E  EB3067 EB3138B  You may contact your floor support representative for any testing assistance. 
beck-s	 I wanted to update you on a few items for the Calgary office.  We have  continued to recruit for the Risk group.  On Tuesday, August 8, Brian Gillis  will be starting as a manager in the Risk group.  Brian was previously a  controller at Koch and was someone that Drew Lynch had tried to recruit  previously when Brian was at Price Waterhouse.  The expectation for Brian is  that he will learn our Risk systems and assume some of the leadership role  for the junior risk employees from Kathy Reeves.  This will get Kathy out of  the day-to-day risk activities, and allow me to broaden her skill sets  outside of the Risk area.  Kathy is the best candidate to train as backup for  me (not that I am planning to leave anytime soon!), so I want her to spend  some time in the documentation area and eventually logistics.  We are still  looking for one additional risk person because of the power activities which  will be significantly increasing by year end.  In the documentation department, I have promoted Dianne Seib to a Lead  position.  Dianne is very strong and will now assume work direction and  performance review responsibilities for the eight employees in that  department.  I have also hired one senior clerk who will start on September  1st in preparation for the increased power activities.  This will give the  new person time to train on physical and financial confirmations prior to the  start up of the power trading.  I will be loaning Chris Wiebe to the IT group for a three-month period to  work on developmental IT activities.  Many of the departments in Calgary have  need for higher level excel skills, macros, queries from the various  databases, development of access databases, etc. that will increase the  efficiency of our processes.   Chris has a lot of skills in these areas.   Because we are not sure if this position is a long-term or short-term  requirement for Calgary, we will put Chris into this role for three months  and then evaluate the status of the position at that time.  Chris will still  work part-time in my department particularly with respect to input on the  next generation systems requirements which are now underway.   Because of the addition of three risk employees that were not previously  budgeted for, I will be exceeding my budget for the remainder of the year.  I  know that Houston is in the same situation, but I wanted to make sure you  were aware that Calgary will have the same issue.  Both Rob Milnthorp and Jon  McKay are aware of the situation, and were supportive of the expansion of the  risk department as they ultimately benefit from this.  I don't know if you've picked any tentative dates for your trip to Calgary,  but I wanted to let you know that Beth Perlman is also planning a trip up  this month.  We had tentatively talked about sometime during the week of  August 21st.  I haven't been able to confirm her final plans as she has been  on vacation for the past two weeks.  This is my schedule for the remainder of August:   Vacation;  August 14 - 18  Customer event: Monday - August 21  Back office golf tournament - afternoon of August 28th  Cross-Alta golf tournament - afternoon of August 29th  The back office golf tournament is an annual event and includes all of my  staff and Laura's and is a lot of fun.  We have a mix of golfers and  non-golfers so we set it up as a no-pressure scramble tournament.  If you  want to come on the 28th, we'd be happy to include you in the tournament.  Thanks again for talking to Wes about Laura Scott.  I really appreciate it.   Just something to think about, since Laura has the client services function  for Calgary, would it make sense if she reported to you instead of Wes?  Talk to you soon. Peg

beck-s	 Dear Mike,  As we discussed, you will be heavily involved in constructing and  implementing global standards and global reporting.  This is a strategic  initative requested by the commercial teams as well as Causey.  This  absolutely must be in place by the end of the year.  Essentially, there are three main areas:  develop global (minimum) standards develop & implement exception reporting to these standards develop & implement global operation reporting  I have put together milestones for us to work by in these projects:  Global operating performance  This  will be the monthly reporting package.  Currently we do this for N.  America.  We need to establish a reporting format for the products/locations  currently not included in this package.  The package is not intended to be  incorporated into the current package, but use it as a guide to create our  own.  Timeline: Aug 31 - Finalize what will be reported Sept 15 - Finalize reporting lines (who we are getting this info from @ each  location and who is receiving and consolidating it) Sept 30 - Close of business for sept 30 we should have our first consolidated  reporting package to report Oct 30 - Collect feedback from 1st reporting package and redesign reporting  if necessary (continual improvements)  Global standards time line (daily reporting)  This will be the exception reporting based on the global standards we  create.  This will be a daily reporting package.  Timeline: August 31 - finalize global standards into 2 buckets Quantitative (to be reported daily) Qualitative (to be reviewed within doorstep reviews) Sept 15 - Establish measurable targets for quantitative standards Sept 30 - Finalize reporting format for quantitative reporting lines (who do  we get it from, who consolidates it, who sees it, how often) Nov 30 - Have reporting implemented - start reporting  Regards  SHona  PS - I'm also working on developing a monthly reporting summary for each  office concerning what the latest developements are, much like they have in  London.  I have Maria working on developing a list of all offices.

The next  steps would be to solicit feedback from other interested parties and scope  the resources and responsibilities. Ted  Rick Buy, John Lavorato and I met to discuss priorities as it relates to the  calculation of VAR.  We are making the following recommendations   1) Inclusion of monthly index positions into VAR calculations as the  indicies set in North American Natural Gas  2) Development of a methodology to re-run correlations (factor loadings)  including criteria, responsibilities and acceptance/rejection criteria  3) Development of process by which to analyze the output of factor loading  process.  Database to store output and management reports.  4) Finalize debate on the calculation of Forward/Forward volatility  5) Scope a project to analyze the possibility of calculating hourly  volatility for power.  It was further recommended that we continue to not include unpriced index  positions in VAR calculation. 
beck-s	 Sally I will give some deep thought over the weekend in the meantime here are some current thoughts regarding Brent's trip First I am hopeful that a letter will go out regarding Brent before his trip and that it clearly states that Brent will continue to report directly to you (that sends a powerful message locally and globally) Is that going to occur? Assuming the above takes place what is the messaage you (Sally) want Brent to convey on your behalf at each and every meeting he attends with his and your people.  Thirdly I would suggest that Brent and Scott not try to hit a homerun on this first trip. You as well as Brent and Scott do not need to win the respect of Shankman so I strongly urge consistency, maturity and incredible listening skills in fully understanding the DEPTH and exact nature of the problems arising so solutions arise from the strength of the data surrounding the core issues.  I would prepare Brent with any language you would want him to appropriately respond to possible questions from Sheriff, Dyson, Jordan or anyone else for that matter who might want to probe into whether all of operations is going to roll up under you.  Until you have your meeting with Frevert I would offer that any questions that may come Brent's or Scott's way simply be diplomatically deferred. Have them make simple I statements "All I know is that my role here is to....." I can't speak to what might be happening with other product lines."  I will read closely your notes, please have mary solmonson give you a copy of Freverts talk at the global systems gathering and see if there are a couple of connection points for you to gateway your vision for global consistency to align with his.    1) My (Sally) vision for this looks like this.... 2) Why it makes sense to do this now? What's at risk if we don't do this now? Paint a relistic yet challenging picture in hopes that he asks, Are you Sally up to the challenge? 3) Others support this as well (Does he care, if so who else?) 4) I want to move forward effective .....Do I have your support  If you have some time on Monday let Patti know and I will give you a call. Assuming that a letter goes out on Brent will you put a letter out on ENA Risk, Settlementges, Logistics, other staff changes such as Scribner, Sheila, Hall, etc. If you do not have the time to write it up let me know and I can support you with a draft for your modification, however I would want to talk specifics Monday.  I am very excited for you and the organization and remain hopeful that this is yet another growth experience preparing you for an even greater role  Regrds  Tom       ------Original Message------ From: "Sally Beck" <Sally.Beck@enron.com> To: tom.hopwood@gte.net Sent: August 11, 2000 7:15:12 PM GMT Subject: Meeting with Mark Frevert - Should We Move It Up?

We are set for next Thursday, August 17 at 11:45 in Rick Causey's office over lunch.  I am meeting with Ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of the meeting and to be certain that I have his support.  Rick Causey suggested citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with Frevert.  Any words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting?

Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve.  Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean. I told him that you and I had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month.  What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL operations. I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, rather than arrive at the party late.  
beck-s	 Mike, Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while  speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to  overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as  EnronOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.  I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from Enron, but let's put  ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a  potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the  hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely  on anything until we see everything working.  Handling counterparties not using the system The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the  Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other  procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT  Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the  concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone  else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom  has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us  closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly  achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.  How much resource is left The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who  are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving  onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and  then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold  off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end  up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through  costing for "What happens if we completely stop development of X project?".  If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else  comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases  it is not!  Start small to prove concept E.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields This is excellent, and we needn't shout it too loud to investors in CL, but  for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be  years before we can switch off many internal systems. We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3  years out?  Include European aspects from the beginning This really isn't very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense  Europeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development  from the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower  which took a year to allow just for currencies etc!  80-20 rule for types of transaction EOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first. Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk  (RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP,  and yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual  approaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many  different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which  makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of  certain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and  manually tweaked every so often)  Testing Tom's first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not  pay) to do much of the testing. EOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to  have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different  phases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance. EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many  external users early in the process. It did have massive  resource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the  Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the  same sort of user attention? Given how often I hear "short people", that  strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional  resource, even after MG is absorbed.  What else did you come up with? Richard 
beck-s	 I would like to have this same monthly reporting for all offices of the US.   This sort of piggybacks off the discussion we had yesterday on the need for  office information.  Do you have someone in your group who would have time to take on this  project?  Should this project reside in your group or somewhere else?  If  you could give me your thoughts I'd appreciate it.

beck-s	 Sally, Below is a draft of the official organization announcement that will address  Brent and his team.  I was unable to get this out earlier and am ready upon  your review.  Please examine the Brent section and make sure that it is  correct and stated properly.  Please send your comments back ASAP and I'll  get this out.  Thanks, Mike  draft  After having conducted our first of several business reviews, we'd like to  outline the following organizational changes effective immediately.  The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous  opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the  different commercial functions, and to capture market share and value, the  group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets,  and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our  weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.   Still under consideration - The Enron Corporate Insurance group under Jim  Bouillion will now report into the corporate organization under  George  Wasaff.  Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President and Chief  Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to  Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Enron  Corp.  He will be responsible to Sally Beck for the business operations areas  of the businesses.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila  Glover, business controller for Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business  controller for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global  liquids and coal.  In addition, Tom Myers as Director of Accounting.  Brent  and his team are responsible for all accounting and position reporting issues  for all the businesses within EGM.   Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for  Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.   Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.  
beck-s	 Sally,  As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well  but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or  another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable.  Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible  for much of what we achieved.  As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been  significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now  recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the  29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas  Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.  There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit  from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I  am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo  pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put  together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to  potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.  Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss  whether Todd would be available come over.  Thanks and regards James

beck-s	 I agree with the exception of point 3 below.  I plan for them to be one of  several authorisers of bills (in no case however, the only authorisers).   Also, I spoke to Sally about the "agency" office and she agrees that in the  short term, the agency plan is what we need to implement.  However, a  mentioned by both Ted and Sally, we need to discuss what the ultimate goal is  for these offices (will they continue to exist?).  Let's call what we plan to  implement now "Phase I".

That  way any incoming confirmations etc go to the independent ops group.  Rule 2: No cash payments or receipts in respect of transactions approved or  reconciled by remote offices  Operations hubs should reconcile cash movements to changes in position.  Rule 3: No physical settlements or receipts in respect of transactions  approved or reconciled by remote offices  This splits the logistics process somewhat, but is essentially as with cash  in that every movement of physical product should be approved (where  necessary) and reconciled to movements in the position at operations hubs.  The "initiation/optimisation" aspect of logistics could remain remote, since  arguably it involves pseudo - trading.  Not exhaustive but helpful I hope.

Shona and Naomi have worked with the people in New York to put in place extra  controls so that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in  New York or London own each book and sign off on profit daily. This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not  all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same. Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some  originate, and some execute for Trading Offices.  is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit. All the cc above are bought in to this approach. What do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to Causey and  Buy?  It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for  the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch  that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

beck-s	 Sally  I just want to summarize/clarify our discussions so far on the Commercial= =20 Support model for Enron Japan.=20  My background: In Europe the Commercial Support function was divided into a Middle Office= =20 (MO) and a Back Office (BO) part, with a European controller (Fearnley Dyso= n)=20 responsible for both functions.

Can you please let Karen and me know who  the winners are and who should be invited from the university for the  dinner at Jeffrey's on September 7.

We will be sending  this to Louise/Dave to highlight some of those that may require commercial  intervention. Sheri ---------------------- Forwarded by Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT on 08/25/2000 01:34  PM ---------------------------   Torrey Moorer 08/24/2000 04:47 PM To: Sheri Thomas cc:   Subject: Trend Analysis for Select Commodity Groups  Attached is a trend analysis on the four primary commodity groups which have  either been demonstrating, or have been thought to be demonsrating, a decline  in EOL transactions as a percentage of total trading activity. The graphs for  each group represent a line plot of EOL's weekly percentage of total trading  activity by deal count and volume over the last three months. The attachment  also contains source data on the second and third pages, which gives the  absolute numbers represented by the percentages shown on the graphs. These  sheets contain several additional commodity groups which have demonstrated a  decreasing or erratic EOL trend, but were not graphed because they averaged  less than 10-15 total transactions (both EOL and non-EOL) per week.   A few notes on the four graphed commodity groups:  AUSTRIAN POWER -  The overall EOL trend as a percentage of transactions in  Austrian Power has been upward over the last three months, despite the sharp,  temporary decrease which took place at the end of July as a result of the  head Austrian Power Trader and Stack Manager going on holiday. Since his  return, the percentage has picked back up and as of 8/22 about 30% of  Austrian Power trades were once again being done through EOL. There is cause  for concern here, however, in the fact that the absence of one trader  effectively shut off EOL trading in this commodity group.   LPG - The LPG products have followed a somewhat erratic path since inception,  with EOL transactions typically accounting for between 20 and 30 percent of  total LPG trading activity. This overall trend remains intact and as of 8/22,  EOL accounted for 26% of LPG trades.  Crude & Products - This commodity group has been demonstrating a steady  decline in EOL trading activity over the last three months. While EOL trades  accounted for approximately 20% of all crude and products activity in May,  this percentage has dropped off to just over 10% as of August 22nd. This  trend is particularly disturbing because of its consistancy, as well as the  relatively large data pool on which it is based.   UK Power - Although the absolute number of trades in UK Power dropped off  significantly at the end of July, EOL's percentage of UK Power transactions  has remained fairly stable. EOL's percentage of UK Power trades "spiked"  briefly during the second week of June, but outside of this the percentage of  UK Power trading represented by EOL transactions has fluctuated between 20  and 40 percent. On trade date 8-22, EOL transactions accounted for just over  50% of all transactions done in UK Power.

Please keep in mind this is a  tentative draft.  Mark and Andrew still want to perform some QA on the  results and Torrey is still looking into some of the observations.    To summarize, we observed a significant improvement from the last test we  performed a few months ago.  The systemic problems that created a large  volume of the discrepancies in our previous testing have been greatly  reduced.  The majority of the discrepancies identified in the most recent  testing are primarily a result of random data entry errors and some deal  booking changes made in the back office without the Product Control Group's  knowledge.  Torrey has already corrected the most significant discrepancies  and is continuing to investigate the smaller items.    Andrew and I will both be on vacation for the week of August 28.  When we  return, we will set up a meeting with you and Dave to discuss the final  results once Torrey has had time to conclude his research.    Steve    
beck-s	 All fixed priced deals (esp. Calpine) have their risk assigned to the Price  Book.  Dutch Quigley confirmed that these deals were more than likely hedged  (although it is difficult to hedge 20 year deals since we are one of the few  playing out that far).  If we are under the assumption that we will be able  to transfer all hedges along with the deal(s), then these deals are not  underwater.  However, there will be some costs associated with transferring  the hedges.  When I get a better idea of these costs I will relay them to  you.   Dave       	Enron North America Corp.

I have also been  involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real  key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is  talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional  eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job,  but we do need everyone thinking of "what if's."  Our risk books are complex,  with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of  the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the  day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our  meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our  approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on  (Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).  FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1,  and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure that  I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the  Triple Lutz data room.    In my absence next week, I want to reiterate to each of you that I am  available, and will have the Triple Lutz data with me.  If any issues come up  that you feel I can be helpful, please contact yvette Connevey @  713-853-5953, and she will get in touch with me.  Once again, DO NOT HESITATE  TO CALL ME!!!  I do not want anything falling through the cracks!  
beck-s	 Hello Everyone, Please find below the issues, action taken, and action plan / proposed  resolution for GCP / SAP / Mid Office Systems interface. If you have further questions/comments, please feel free to contact me.  Regards, Janet  Issues: Brazil and Argentina Tax Code - Counterparty tax code for these countries are  required in SAP but not in GCP. Bank Partner Type Changes - Partner bank type changes for counterparties --  triggered by master data changes in GCP -- while bank data remains the same,  resulting in invoices being paid to the incorrect bank and/or bank account. Ownership - who owns what?  Action Taken: Brazil and Argentina Tax Code Meeting took place.  Agreed upon plan is for mid office user to provide tax  requirements and/or codes to Bill.  SAP is waiting for tax requirements  and/or codes to determine whether user exits should be disable (these are  custom user exits SAP has implemented to accommodate the Brazil and Argentina  tax requirements back from 1/01/00 go-live) Bank Partner Type Our understanding is GCP has agreed to modify the GCP program to keep bank  partner type static.  GCP technical team is developing this solution. Ownership Mid Office Users own data GCP maintains counterparty master data GCP and SAP ensure that solution in place to move master data from GCP to SAP  satisfy invoicing and cash processing business requirements.  Summary: Many meetings have taken place.  Major progress has been made.  Now we need  to evaluate GCP reengineering initiative to see whether it affects scope  and  requirements regarding current solution in place for this 3-way interface.  Proposed Resolution: SWAT team representing both Houston and London to be formed and meet in  London week of Sep. 11- 15th to: Address all issues evolving around this interface. Develop solutions to issues, workplan, ownership, and timeline. SWAT team members: Janet Tran - SAP TRAPAR Pamela LeBrane - SAP TRAPAR Diem Pham - SAP Technical  -- Will already be in London that week for EEL Bill Hare - GCP Functional (Houston) Mary Solmonson - GCP Functional (Global)  -- Will already be in London that  week for other business Energy Operations Reprentative(s) - with Brazil / Argentina tax knowledge Bhautik Patel - GCP Functional (London) Brian Hunter-Lindsay - GCP Functional (London) John Paskin - SAP London 
beck-s	 We still do not have a good cash flow from ERMS.  Several Books which were  changed on Friday did not get added back by Risk Controls in the clean-up  process this morning, including the book, MAHII, which had the $650 milllion  prepay. Sheila  ---------------------- Forwarded by Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT on 28/08/2000 13:42  ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Sheila Glover                           28/08/2000 11:34 	  To: Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally  Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Michael E Moscoso/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pushkar  Shahi/HOU/ECT@ECT, Clara Carrington/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/Market  Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Samantha T Davidson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joyce  Kuo/NA/Enron@Enron  Subject: Controls needed to ensure cashflows are received by Infinity  Shona, Brent and Sally, This morning, the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by  Infinity from the ERMS system.  We normally get 375 books and only got 296  this morning.  Per conversation with Joyce Kuo and Mike Moscoso, Susan Trevino, Risk  Controls,  and Christian, RAC, changed the book heirarchy on Friday, moving  global products books, including the prepays, out of the ECT group and into  another group.  We have had discussions in the past verifying with Risk  Controls that the ECT group is the only group which automatically sends its  cash flows to Infinity.  Other cash flows from books are included only by  being listed in a script.  This was not done when the books were moved from  the ECT Group on Friday.  Obviously, the Rate & Currency is not able to hedge Enron's cash flows when  so much has been omitted.   At this time we are about one hour away from a  good Hedging report for the trading desk.  This report is due the desk daily  by 7:30 am.  Mike and I discussed the need for controls and sign-off by him or Shona for  changes in book heirarchy.   Sheila  
beck-s	 Patti,  Here is the information you requested for the Conference in October.  I  listed the information I will need to make final booking arrangements on the  first spreadsheet.  There is a spreadsheet for dates-locations, directions,  and conference package info..  If you have any questions, please do not  hesitate to contact me.  Call me after you review, so we can get together to  finalize details.      Thank you,  Julissa Marron, x58336 
beck-s	 Report is missing some VAR's because London was not in the office.   Please launch the Excel application rather than using the Lotus Notes Viewer. Please note that the DPR (and therefore this report) is preliminary. 
beck-s	 Sally,  As I told you last week, I laid a big egg and "put the cat amongst the  pigeons" as Steve Stock put it.  Phillipe called a meeting with Rick (and  me), Debbie Brackett and Steve yesterday to "clear the air".  While he  pledged to be attentive to the problem (as I articulated), he still focused  on fixing process which I fear gets us to where we thought we were as opposed  to where we need to be.  I continue to believe that not only are there things  just plain broken, but what we have gotten used to as "acceptable" is now  inadequate.  This includes the ability for "human" systems and processes to  be automated to avoid stupid downstream data problems as well as improve  analytics.  You will be cordially invited to be (another) weekly meeting that  both Rick and Phillipe plan to attend to monitor and guide progress. Ted       	Enron North America Corp. 	 	From:  Sally Beck                           08/28/2000 06:48 PM 	  To: Stephen Stock/HOU/ECT@ECT, Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:  (bcc: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT) Subject: ERMS Resources  I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you  know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources  for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the  rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara  will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned  as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to "catch up", if  you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several  years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to  grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going  basis.     I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS  as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production  support will be managed and how development work will be effectively  handled.    I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.

beck-s	 URGENT  The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number  of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the  fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our  on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure  will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.  It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team  members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron  recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made  arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of   40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month  of September and end at mid October.  Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please  select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores  Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take  dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough  sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst  recruiting teams.  In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of  these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be  given for attending this workshop.

beck-s	 Sally, Bob  FYI - Nice note from the Chicago office regarding the roll-out and training  in Unify. As you might know they are live on September 1 with Unify.  Currently they are only pathing on NGPL but we expect them to expand to  include both Trunkline and Northern Border. They have elected not to EDI  until  they get more comfortable with the system (maybe for October  business).   We will continue to develop their staff on the use of Unify through  additional training as noted below - Bob ---------------------- Forwarded by Robert Superty/HOU/ECT on 08/31/2000  09:05 AM ---------------------------   Richard Tomaski@ENRON 08/30/2000 06:16 PM To: Robert Superty/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Laura Luce, Barbara G Dillard/Corp/Enron@Enron  Subject: PGL unify training  Bob-   Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know that Richard Pinion's unify  training secession was very sucessful.  The PGL employees that he trained  were very complementary of Richard and they now feel confident that they will  be able to use our system.   They are already looking forward to his return  visit in September.    Thankyou for your involvement with the Chicago office and our implementation  of the Unify system.     Richard

Sheila ---------------------- Forwarded by Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT on 08/31/2000 11:43  AM ---------------------------   Clara Carrington 08/31/2000 10:31 AM To: Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Joyce Kuo/NA/Enron@Enron  Subject: Summary of Cash Flow Events  Sheila,  We have been having issues with the commodity cash flows since last Friday,  Aug 25.  This is a listing of what's been going on.               TIME PDH DATE     COMMODITY BOOK GIVEN TO TRADER   SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION  8/25/00 ENPOWER - WEST  7:05    Original    West cash flows did not look  right.  Valerie left voice mail          late Thursday night stating not to treat the $18M gain as           final.  She indicated that Lavorato was going to review the          cash flows  this morning and she will let us know the final           number at that time.  These cashflows created a $19,000          PV01 affect.                7:45    Re-ran w/old West CF  After consulting with Pushkar, we  replaced  the new west              cash flows with prior days so hedging  could begin.      10:15   Final    Spoke with Monica Lande at 9:30am and she stated that  the             original cash flows received were real. We then had to           bring the original cash flows back and re-do the PDH           reports.  8/28/00 refer to email sent by Sheila on this day.  8/29/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:35     Cash flows received from the UK book looked  really weird.           The $38M cash flow curve change created a 15,000 PV01          affect.  We contacted Guy Freshwater regarding.  He          indicated that per Mark Fondren, the book was officialized           Monday, on Friday since Monday was a Holiday for their           Office.  We backed out the new cash flow, and then substituted          the old ones.  8/30/00 UK-NAP-LT-PRC 7:30  Original    The same thing happened as 8/29/00.   The book was not officialized       7:45  Final    on 8/29, therefore we received the same incorrect cash  flows.  We again          substituted these cash flows with those received on 8/25/00.  I  talked with          Mark Fondren and he indicated that the book has now been  officialized.          (In the past we have not had issues with the UK commodity Books in  the           ERMS system. )  8/31/00 ENPOWER - WEST 7:20  Original    Cash flows received for west created  a 14,000 PV01 affect.  We contacted     8:00  Final    Monica Lande and she informed us that there was a $14 M  loss in their book,           but $6 M was not real.  We asked for a cash flow strip for the  incorrect flows, but          she was not able to provide it.  Therefore, we  used the previous day's cash          flows.  After the 7:20 PDH report, the system started running slow,  therefore          it took even longer to produce a revised report.

beck-s	 Well, today (or rather yesterday) it happened.  We have been pushing our limits  hard and the makets here have been very volatile.  We had a large increase in  North American Natural Gas VAR due to the breaking apart the Rockies/SoCal  basis correlation.  This am, we were attempting to get firm numbers on the  effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide  Jeff/Delainey/Lavorato/Buy/.... the information to make decisions whether or  not to reduce positions.  The number was not firm until 11 am houston time.   My understanding is that the Houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that  we were waiting for London.  While I am sure that there are issues all around  and I do not think that anyone Senior in Houston is even aware, let alone  prepared to blame, I fear that this will not always be the case.  I think  something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in  the future.     Please do not take this as a nasty-gram.  No one is cc'd or bcc'd.  I just  think that it will be deemed unacceptable. Any thoughts/comments? Ted

beck-s	 As you may well know we are being pushed by Arthur Andersen to bring our  prudency policy in line with that of North America.  In response to these  pressures, we have conducted a thorough review of our prudency policy and  have determined that all discretionary prudency and general reserves  (including VAR based prudency) should be eliminated. Deal specific prudency  will, however, remain. In order to avoid any arguments with AA near the  quarter end the release to the London summary DPR should happen today for the  August month end.  Apologies for the short notice but the final decision was only made very  recently. Please pass this message around to those people in your groups who  are not on the above mail list so that 'everyone' is aware of the change.  If there are any questions please let me know.

beck-s	 I would like to thank everyone for participating in the first Wellesley Team  Meeting.  I regret the delay in processing the minutes.  The career placement  center has been really busy and I needed to contact them to get some of the  questions answered from the meeting.  For those of you who were unable to  attend, I have listed the topics of discussion:  Goals for Wellesley - Hiring goal of 4 (not limited to) Analyst Program changes - Structure ( Team Leaders), Developmental Program, 2  day interview process Interview Training Workshop - Everyone that will be interviewing is required  to attend a 2 hour session Roles and Responsibilities - Role of team members, Participation is tracked  for PRC recognition. Wellesley Campus Plan  - We discussed the presentation time being pushed back.  I was able to get  it pushed back to 5:00  o'clock at the latest.  There are other companies  scheduled to present on that date and that was the  latest time we coud get.   There will be no class conflicts on that date (September 28, 2000).   We   discussed the attire for the presentation being casual (jeans).  That concept  was  proposed to the  career placement center Assistant (Bernice Tita) and  she said that casual attire will be well received.   We would need to just  indicate it when we publicize the event.  - We discussed changing the interview dates due to scheduling conflicts.   The dates that we were  able to get were November 20th and 21st.   - We discussed possible recruiting at neighboring schools(Smith & Mt. Holy  Oke)  - We discussed taking the company jet to some or all the events, especially  when we will be   involving recruiting efforts at the neighboring schools. Target Groups -  Economic Student Board Association, All majors  I have forwarded the Wellesley recruiting guide to those of you who were  unable to attend.  If you have not received it by now, please contact me and  I will get one to you a.s.a.p.  I have meetings scheduled with Jean Mrha and Cindy Olson to work on the  participants for the events and afterwards I will get the revised campus plan  to the team.  If you have any questions regarding the contents of this e-mail  or other Wellesley recruiting questions, feel free to contact me at any time.  Thanks, Geynille      Thanks a million,   Geynille

beck-s	 Sally,  This morning I spent some time with David Maxwell of the Merchant Asset  group.  I am very intrigued by the work the group does.  Knowing that Todd  Hall has moved on to EGM and that the Merchant Asset Group is in transition  to report to Shona Wilson, I have a recommendation.  I would like for the  Merchant Asset Group to report to me.  Although I do not know all the  methodologies used by the group, I am familiar with the valuation of assets  and understand the underlying principals for most methods.  At Fleming I was  involved, at a much smaller scale, in the reporting of similar portfolios and  believe that I can be of assistance to the group in moving away from their  current spread sheet environment.  Also, I enjoyed talking with David Maxwell  and understand what he is up against.  I believe he and I would work really  well together.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.  James

This change caused a (10,200) PV01 affect on the  trader's sensitivity report.  After talking with Susan in EI, it was brought  to our attention that the Bolivian curve was loaded incorrectly on Friday,  due to a change in EI's curve upload process.   This change resulted in the  Bolivian curve loading throughout 2012, when it actually goes out to 2019.   The incomplete curve caused  infinity to get bad cash flows.    As a result, we had to re-do PDH reports this morning.  Final reports were  given to traders at 9:00 am.  Clara

beck-s	 The August end of month close is behind us.  Once again, we learned some  things. We made progress.....but we also have issues to work.    Summary On Improvements For This End Of Month Close  I would like to congratulate the users, the application team and the DBA team  for a much improved end of month close for August gas. This would not have  been possible without the significant commitment, focus and teamwork  exhibited by all the folks involved in this effort.   The most tangible measure of progress over the July close :  We were able to keep all users in the system throughout the final week. No  one was kicked off the system. The gas accounting close process finished on time. Key users and IT folks  didn't have to work significant overtime to finish the process.    Improvements arose from :   Upgrading the Unify system to Sybase 12 with extra server memory. This  reduced system 'locking and blocking' and made it possible to keep all users  in the system throughout the week. Nightly settlements for gas invoicing also  ran much faster. Many thanks to the DBAs - Jim Ogg and Kishroe Bharathi-- for  many late nights and weekends. Many thanks also to the application team and  the users for lots of testing before the production rollout.  Conducting a pre-planning session that identified new end of month techniques  to improve efficiency. The users generated several new ideas including the  idea to pre-process PMAs the night before running the current mass draft.  This meeting provided several new approaches, a clear plan and cohesive  communication throughout the end of month process. Many thanks to the all the  users as well as Bob Superty, Bryce Baxter, Melissa Ratnala, Dave Nommensen  and Chris Schomer for making this happen. Many of these ideas will now be  part of a standard process.   The performance monitoring and tuning team reacted quickly to address changes  in system performance. Many thanks to Matt Pena and the rest of this team for  keeping the system up and running as fast as possible during the day.   Release of a new tuned version of the Accurals process that runs much faster.    Issues, Challenges, Action Items  While we made progress this month, there are still several significant issues  and opportunities for improvement. The following is a list of the things that  'went bump in the night' and the action items we've identified.   1. We experienced several Sybase 12.0 errors early in the week that impacted  gas business. All of these problems are now fixed. This had the following  business impacts:  The bridgeback of deals to Sitara was delayed. These deals were bridged  manually before the end of month valuation. We also fixed the code problem  that generated th original problem. Global Systems replication to Unify was down on Monday. This problem was  fixed with a software patch from Sybase Monday evening. All affected deals  were then uploaded. Nominations were completed for these deals on Monday  through manual estimation by the schedulers.  Communication between the DBA group and the application group was delayed on  the Global Systems replication problem. This delayed our ability to notify  users of the problem. Communication on problems will be be improved in the  future. The default assumption will be to notify key application and  infrastructure personnel as soon as any serious problem is identified.   2.  We experienced a hardware issue with a bad server CPU at 3:00AM on  Thursday.  As a result, database backups ran into the morning when the server  came back up. This created slow system response and delayed logins for users  until 10:00 AM. This problem is now fixed.   Action Item: Kishore will coordinate with Randy Matson from the  infrastructure group to coordinate a stress test of all production server  components. This will allow us to see if we can find any other marginal  components.  This will be completed by September 18.   3. All service PMAs for ENA and HPLC were not picked up by the Settlements  process. HPLC PMAs were run manually by the users. For ENA, missing PMAs were  immaterial and the users decided to close with these results. We have now  found and fixed the error that caused this problem.   Action Item: Chris Schomer is having his team investigate this problem to  see if this is just a Sybase 12.0 issue or whether this error could have  impacted previous months. A determination should be available by September  15.   4. Enpower deal load did not load deals with referenced prices correctly.  These deals have now been successfully loaded and are currently completed  through the mass draft process for power. We have identified and fixed the  software error that caused this problem.   5. Power mass draft is now running very slow as compared to prior months. We  are currently working to complete the Power mass draft process. It will be  completed by the user deadline for close of business Wednesday Sept. 6.   Action Item: Chris Schomer's team is investigating why the Power mass draft  is running so slow.  At present we do not have a definitive answer. We hope  to develop a definitive answer and action plan by September 15. Our current  hypothesis for why we have this problem includes :  Data changes - we now have a much higher volume of hourly priced deals Potential database index issues. We will re-build all power database indexes  and re-compile the stored procedures Sybase optimizer flakiness. We often see Sybase suddenly start to have  processing problems for no apparent reason.     Update On Future Tactical  And Strategic Improvements  We have several pending tactical Unify performance improvements that are in  process. These include:   1) Isolating Unify Gas on a server of it's own  2) Delivery of a middle tier mass draft process to reduce locking and blocking 3) Upgrade of the middle tier mass draft process to allow for drafting at a  deal level (rather than just a counter-party level) 4) Delivery of the nominations and balancing process on a middle tier  architecture.  Ramesh Rao and his team have the strategic projects progressing on schedule.   We are seeing significant performance gains in our testing of SQL Server over  Sybase. We also have identified a couple of hardware vendors that could  provide very large, scaleable computing environments for this type of Unify  architecture. We plan to have all critical evaluation testing completed by  the end of September as planned. We will present our recommendations along  with a high-level strategic delivery plan by early October.    Let me know if you have any questions or concerns --  x39694 or (713)  503-4873.   Thanks.

Clara 
beck-s	 We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the  DPR:   Return on VaR (ROVAR) Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio Risk - Return (Large) Risk - Return (Small)  All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return.  The  markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics.  Furthermore,  Enron's appetite for risk also differs in each market.  As a result, it is  difficult to compare returns in absolute terms.  Therefore, the approach of  these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating  return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every  dollar we put at risk).    For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average  of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR.  Higher ROVARs  indicate better performance (relative to other business units).  For each  business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the  left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light  blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis.   Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be  quite high or low, and it changes frequently.   The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of  daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard  deviation. This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new  deals, reserves, and so forth).  Furthermore, whereas VaR is a forward  looking statistic (the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given  probability), standard deviation is backward looking (the actual volatility  of our returns over the period). This graph also has two bars for every  business unit or commodity group: a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe  ratio on a 4 week rolling basis, and a light brown on the right showing the  ratio on a 1 week basis.  The Curve Shift P&L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other  well.  They measure different things, but if our P&L is composed mostly of  curve shift, and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility, the two  statistics should be very close.   Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the P&L relative  to the risk.  We therefore put together the Risk - Return graphs.  On the  vertical axis, they show 4 week rolling average P&L.  On the horizontal, they  show 4 week rolling average VaR.  The various business units are plotted as  points on the graphs.  These graphs are closely related to the 4-week ROVARs,  in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is  the business unit's ROVAR (average P&L / average VaR).  Another way of  looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin  (0,0) with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR.  Books with  small risks and returns (< $2 million) are plotted on the "Small" graph, and  the rest, on the "Large".  These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and  capture the information that is reported in the DPR.  Most, but not all of  the information in the DPR currently flows from the database.  As a result,  we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit.  As we  continue to set up exports into the database, we will fill in the missing  numbers.  We will e-mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the  intra-net.  Please remember to launch the file in Excel, instead of using the  Lotus Notes viewer.  The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are  already on the web.  We hope that you find all of these useful.    Regards,    Eugenio Perez

beck-s	 Sally,   While I think it makes sense for this type of information to be available,  that it should be done by Operations, and that Eugenio has the skills and  knowledge to articulate it well, I have some concerns.   First and foremost,  the process of creating a standard risk metric belongs to RAC, I believe.  To  me this is no different than VAR, or the Capital Pricing methodololgy, or the  RAROC process.   This has been published without even a review from our  group, which I think is inappropriate for two reasons: 1) we might disagree  and, as stated above, I think we have the final say, and 2) we can't quality  control it and all the reciepients think that I have.  Second, this has been  developed in isolation when in fact we have been doing similar things for the  past 2 years. We report these to the Board and have published to the Desk  heads on a monthly basis returns by trader.  Clearly, there could have been  some benefit in each direction if we were told that this was a goal of this  group, particularly when we fundamentally agree that this group should be  doing these things.  Thirdly, it is a little irritating when someone sets up  a process in isolation for what may appear to be "show-time" when my group is  spending hours and hours analyzing the output of existing process because the  data integrity is so bad (double mapping of portfolios, books not  officialized......) - we have at least attempted to take both parts of the  equation, Eugenio has chosen to focus on the cool part.  Now I would be a  little less concerned if on almost every day, Eugenio wasn't in my morning  meeting contributing virtually nothing, i.e., this doesn't appear to be  oversight on his part.  I would prefer to not make a big deal out of this, but rather take it as an  opportunity to clarify and shift some responsibilities.  In the big scheme of  things it is a move in the right direction.

beck-s	 The following is the current status of our outstanding items:  Observation: RED:  Foreign currency risks are managed by the respective  trader within each of the trading portfolios:  Status:  Revise target date to November 30, 2000.  The new associate in  charge of currency starts September 15th.  Due to the complex nature of the  problem, she will require time to gain an understanding of the currency risks  in each of the books, and to determine the most effective process to manage  the risks within the various trading portfolios.

beck-s	 I have not received a call back from Jeff Bartlett, but based on the brochure  I received from Louise, here is what I understand:  DealBench is a way to streamline processes to efficiently execute  transactions and distribute deal-related information.  There are 5 platform  tools - document sharing, multi-media, auctioning, secure communication, and  deal management.   There are five primary products offered which utilize the  tools provided...  Bank Products, Structured Products, Commercial Paper,  Procurement, and Legal Space.   1) Bank Products - deal management for issuance of debt offerings (credit  revolvers/secured term-notes)  2) Structured Products - deal management for initial issuance or re-sale of  bonds, leveraged leases and other financial transactions 3)  Commercial Paper - deal mgmt for issuance of CP 4)  Procurement - management of wholesale purchasing and selling of various  products 5)  Legal Space - designed to meet the needs of attorneys at law firms (doc  sharing, aggregation and organization in a secure environment)  I have a lot of questions for Jeff, so I will send you a quick note when I  speak to him.  Sheri 
beck-s	 I just wanted to make sure you were aware of one thing in case it comes up on  Friday (or you can bring it up if you would like...).  The only real system  issues we have (outside of EnronOnline IT resources!) are the bridge  resources.  Currenlty, EOL deals bridge to TAGG, Sitara, and Enpower.  We  have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected, and  nail down reasons for bridge failures (among other things).  The problem has  arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is  fully capable of correcting problems, and until last week, these three  individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their  day to day responsibilities.  When Tom Moore left early this year, these guys  were left in limbo.  Luckily, they were seldom out, and all three of them  were very good at getting back to us for the most part.    Now for the good news - Jennifer and I had a meeting with Richard Burchfield  last week - the bridges are now part of his world.  This was initiated by a  memo Jennifer copied Beth on regarding bridge failures.  I will forward this  to you as well.  Richard understands the importance of the bridge and ensured  us that he will add some structure to this group.  It is especially critical  when the Sitara bridge goes down late morning, and we are doing next day  physical deals on EnronOnline.  I have a good working relationship with him  (from the old Synergi days), so I think this will be great for us.  I  provided him copies of the IT Compliance flow charts related to the bridges  so that he could gain an understanding of how they work.   Since this  meeting, Jennifer has contacted additional resources that Richard referred us  to, and they have been very responsive (one of the guys volunteered his pager  and told us to call him any time regarding any bridge...).  So, that said,  hopefully our only "issue" is correcting itself due to Jennifer's  perseverance!  Apart from that, we do have an item on our wish list (EnronOnline IT) to  simplify the messages that are sent across the bridges to hopefully speed up  processing time.  Right now the bridges have to do a lot of thinking to  determine how to book certain deals - we want to eliminate that thinking by  adding a deal type identifier on the deal which will automatically tell the  bridge what to do.  I can give you more details on this if you'd like, but  this is short and sweet explanation...  Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks ST

I  want to educate you a little bit on what can cause  "bridge problems".  First, what I want to explain is their is ONE GUI bridge application for  users (backoffice users) to monitor the bridge but there are MULTIPLE systems that EnronOnline transactions can be pointed to downstream. This is  important to understand because if you do not know this , it may seem like we are having the same problem over & over; ie "the bridge  is having problems". But in actuality, it is DIFFERENT  problems. Still not good - but at least it cannot be isolated to ONE  problem.     Also, due to multiple systems (Sitara, Enpower, GasDesk, Tagg/ERMS,  Powerdesk) are listening for messages from one EnronOnline,  a "bridge" problem could be one of many issues. Some of which are:   The server for EnronOnline  messenger goes down (doesn't send message to  bridge to process)  The Enron network goes down (cannot send message thru bridge)  The NFS server (Enron main server) goes down  Sitara server goes down  Enpower server goes down   Tagg/ERMS server goes down  Deal worker in ANY system gets "hung up"  Huge volume slows down processing time for one or more downstream systems  Scheduled outage for maintenance on server on weekend was not re-started on  Sunday   and the list goes on.....................................  FYI In the past week & 1/2, the following actions happened, which caused  "bridge" problems.    Scheduled outage for maintenance on TAGG/erms server on weekend was not  re-started on Sunday (not smart)  The NFS server (Enron main server) goes down (affected Sitara & Tagg/ERMS)  Deal worker in Sitara system got "hung up" and servers had to be bounced  Member of EnronOnline Dev Team changed data for specific tokenised periods  during trading hours instead of end of day   (This failed deals in bridge for Sitara & Tagg/ERMS)  One thing to remember is you are getting calls from traders & back office.  Traders are calling because they cannot see deals in their position manager application of their system. If they are gas traders, if  could be Sitara or Tagg system. If they are a power trader calling, they cannot see it in Enpower. ecetera, ecetera  If a back office person calls, they are watching the monitor GUI and they can  see deals queing/backing up and know there is a problem.   We are working to resolve some of these issues, particularily,  multi-processing tools, as we know the # of transactions will only increase. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions. I hope this was  helpful.  See below for explanation of problem on Wednesday.      ---------------------- Forwarded by Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT on  08/09/2000 03:50 PM ---------------------------   KARIE HASTINGS 08/09/2000 02:06 PM To: Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Mark Kinkead/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas  Engel/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Sitara Production Problem   I am forwarding a message that explains the Sitara Production problems from  this morning. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.  Karie (36759)     At  9:50am this morning a DealWorker process in the Sitara system became  unresponsive.  At  10:00 am it was determined that the EOLBridge in sitara was not  processing new deal requests and diagnostics lead to an indication that the dealworker was not functioning  properly. At 10:14, am the Dealworker was forced down and a new one restarted. At 10:21 am , the EOLBridge began processing deals.  The cause of the is difficult to determine, but indicators point to an error  in the CORBA product we are using,  most likely due to scalability issues of that product and of Sitara. This is  an issue that is actively being addressed.   --Mark Kinkead 3-1961

beck-s	 Todd,  Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather  Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements  with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the  project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the  "Thunderball" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have  co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for  Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet  trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls  for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be  discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition  of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel  development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep in  mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person  will manage the effort across teams.   Richard

for all North American internal users.  Please log into the temporary website: http://Prod.EnronOnline.com (no www.= )=20 This is a LIVE website and all trades are REAL.  Content of this Email 1. Introduction 2. Version 2.0 Launch Date 3. New Website Features 4. New Stack Manager Features 5. Your Participation 6. Contacts  1. Introduction  We are planning to launch version 2.0 of EnronOnline to customers within th= e=20 next few days.  In preparation for this launch, the new web site will be=20 released to internal users in North America on Wednesday, September 13th. = =20 European internal users will be launched shortly after North America. =20 External customers will follow a few days later.=20  One of the purposes of the internal launch is to simulate the system load= =20 which will be caused by the full customer launch.  Accordingly, we apprecia= te=20 your cooperation in helping us to simulate this load by logging into=20 http://prod.enrononline.com (no www.)  This is a live web site and all trad= es=20 are real.  New features (as per recent presentations and training sessions) include:  ? Price limit orders ? Enhanced customization ? Floating windows ? Market news and quotes ? Weather maps and tables ? Industry-specific publications ? Market-specific homepages  2. Version 2.0 Launch Date EnronOnline Version 2.0 will be launched to the public a few days after our= =20 internal launch. We  will be using the new version internally from Wednesda= y,=20 Sept. 13. This will provide an opportunity for you to become familiar with= =20 using the new application in the production environment before our customer= s=20 start to use it.  3. New Website Feature Details  Price limit orders: Customers have the ability to set up orders that=20 automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become=20 available. The limit orders remain open in the system until they are=20 executed, cancelled by the user, or when they expire. All pending orders wi= ll=20 expire no later than 12 hours after being placed.  Pending Price Limit Orders will appear in a new window below the Quotes=20 screen in the website.  Product tabs: EnronOnline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to= =20 create separate page tabs for the products that interest them.  Users can= =20 instantly access each page tab with a click of their mouse. Sort Ordering c= an=20 be changed by clicking on a column heading, with multiple sorts possible by= =20 holding down the shift key while clicking.  Floating windows: Users have the ability to create multiple windows with=20 different products by right-clicking on the products in the main quotes=20 screen.  Market news: Website users can now access the latest headlines, sports and= =20 industry news from Reuters. Furthermore, the information categories can be= =20 customized according to personal interests. To customize a particular=20 category, users need to click the Edit button in the category heading.  All information categories can be collapsed to save space. To expand or=20 collapse a category, users need to click the arrow to the left of the=20 category heading.  Stock quotes: EnronOnline now offers stock quotes (20 min. delay) from majo= r=20 exchanges around the world.  Weather insights: Customers can now access weather maps and temperature dat= a=20 for specific cities and regions.  Weather forecasts, up to six days ahead,= =20 and temperature differentials from periodic averages are now available.  Industry publications: Website users can read a wide range of=20 industry-specific publications including Argus European Natural Gas, Argus= =20 European Electricity, the news from NGI=01,s Daily Gas Price Index, Bandwid= th=20 Desk, Coal Daily and more.  4. New Stack Manager Features  The Stack Manager has been updated to facilitate Price Limit Orders. You wi= ll=20 notice that there is a new button at the top of the Stack Manager, which wi= ll=20 open a window showing a summary of the best Price Limit Order bids and offe= rs=20 against your managed products. You can click the "+" sign to the left of a= =20 summary to show a list of all the Price Limit Orders which have been placed= =20 against that product.  Under normal circumstances, the price shown on the website will be the same= =20 as the price on your Stack Manager. However, the system will not allow you = to=20 show a price which is better than an existing Price Limit Order. Instead, t= he=20 system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing Price= =20 Limit Order while it is being filled. Once the appropriate Price Limit Orde= rs=20 are filled, then the website will again show your Stack Manager prices.  It is important that you complete the =01&Maximum Volume=018 field in the P= roduct=20 Properties window and that you select "Allow Price Limit Orders". Also, mak= e=20 sure that the price tick window in the Stack Manager=01,s =01&Product Prope= rties=018=20 field is appropriate for the product. If you do not do this, your customers= =20 will not be able to use Price Limit Orders for your products.   5. Your Participation Please log in to http://prod.enrononline.com (no www.) on Wednesday. To=20 ensure EnronOnline Version 2.0 is a success, it is important that you have = a=20 full understanding of the new features and help promote the system to your= =20 customers.  6.

beck-s	 I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation  study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.   This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.  It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the  Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists  and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne  has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and  above.  Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey  and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful  experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are  fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient  thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of  your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the  analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a  vested interest in the success of this project!  Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and  below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of  Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for  key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate  further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.  You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will  detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.  Sally

beck-s	 Hi Sally,  I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written records...we'll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we'll travel to Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she's pretty much up for anything.  Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too. Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.  This week's issue of Business Week has Enron in a list of the top 50 companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their business  -- the focus for Enron was on the different trading operations, highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and Enron seems to be in there a lot.  Take Care, Stephanie

beck-s	 Sally and Brent, The write-up below is based upon discussions Jonathan Le and Kevin Lee had  with Steve Stock and Jeremy Wong.   Jonathan and Kevin are working on a new cash flow process for us which should  help to insulate us from the current intra-night process for the ERMS and  EnPower cash flows.

It failed on the step in AutoRho where it runs the query to get all the books  for the Infinity USD portfolio.  Jeremy does not know exactly what caused it  but rerunning AutoRho seemed to work. Recovery used the backup file and was on time.  Tue, Sep 12,2000 Similar problem to Friday, but ENPOWER also failed.  The manenpower.txt file  had TNS errors in it.  AutoRho was not able to kick off the ENPOWER script to  get the cashflows.  Rerunning fixed the problem. AutoRho failed at 3:15am, uploaded only 9 books into Infinity. It failed on the step in AutoRho where it runs the query to get all the books  for the Infinity USD portfolio.  Jeremy does not know exactly what caused it  but rerunning AutoRho seemed to work. Recovery used the file that Jeremy provided in the rerun, they were  approximately 10 minutes late.  Wed, Sep 13,2000 ENPOWER failed creating a header ONLY manenpower.txt file.  There was no  cashflows in the file. Jeremy confirmed the Autorho process was fine. The problem was the ENPOWER databse failed (hardrive failure) and they  immediately went to a backup.  But on the backup database, NOT all the tables  are replicated.  The cashlow table with the ENPOWER data we needed was not in  the backup database resulting in a file with zero flows! This problem has been fixed by the enpower people. Recovery included using the previous day's enpower flows.  They were on time.  Thurs, Sep 14,2000 AutoRho at 3:15 am and 11:00 pm was hung.  Enpower also was not run since  AutoRho failed. Reason was because the UNIX NFS file system "solar" was full  As a result,  our directory /worksheets2, and also /prod/egs-home is mounted on solar but  could not write anything to it.  Supposily the SA are suppose to have been  paged when ever a file system gets close to 100% (can you please confirm  this?).  The Unix NFS was fixed by 5:00 am.  AutoRho was rerun and was fine. Recovery included Jeremy's file.  They were 1 hour late (partly due to other  reasons on MO side, not system related).  Thanks, Kevin Lee

He is hoping to use  the sale of HPL as the start of this.  Leslie and I worked on an org chart  (positions/functions only) for him one evening this week (copy attached).   Now he would like for us to draft an agreement, with associated costs, to  provide to these potential buyers.  The IT services would also be provided,  and the draft of that agreement is also attached.  I have a starting point for us, using the Bridgeline Services agreement (copy  attached).  We learned alot on the Bridgeline model and it is important for  us to learn from those issues and avoid them for this deal.   Additionally, I  have asked Shari Mao to put together costs of salaries and other associated  costs for the positions listed on the org chart.  We should view the costs  from the perspective that the infrastructure is a stand-alone entity.  All  costs that would be incurred as a stand-alone should be recovered in the  bid.  The meeting on Monday will be a working meeting to ensure we have  addressed all concerns and issues, and ensure the bid is appropriate.  Brian  has not been specific on the due date for this, just "sometime next week."  I  talked with Patrick Wade, and he felt Wednesday (9/20) should be the target.

Regards,  Todd Burke X39437     ---------------------- Forwarded by Todd Burke/NA/Enron on 09/18/2000 10:05  AM ---------------------------   Todd Burke 09/14/2000 09:45 AM To: Bob M Hall/NA/Enron@Enron, Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peggy  Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT, Steve Jackson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Leslie Reeves/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Stacey W White/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, James  Scribner/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sheri  Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Upcoming Compensation Analysis   To All Energy Operations Directors:  My name is Todd Burke and I'm a Compensation Specialist with ENA Human  Resources (see attached bio).  As you know, Sally Beck has requested that I  conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current pay arrangements for all  Energy Operations staff.  The purpose of this analysis will be to ensure that  the department's current pay arrangements are in line with the competitive  marketplace.  Each component of pay will be examined individually and within  the context of Enron's compensation philosophy (e.g., base salary, bonus,  long-term incentives and total compensation).  The process will begin with a series of interviews which will be conducted in  two stages:    Stage 1-Data Gathering:  the focus of this stage will be upon gathering data  around your perceptions of your group's current pay arrangements and give you  the opportunity to address any of the internal and external inequities you  perceive to exist.    Stage 2-Job Matching:  the focus of this stage will be on job matching - we  will establish a mutually agreed upon time to meet and discuss which  positions in our salary surveys most accurately reflect the roles and  responsibilities of your staff.  We will not be able to match 100 percent of  your jobs to the jobs contained in the salary surveys.  Non-benchmark jobs  will be reviewed using a job "slotting" approach.  To help facilitate the matching process, I will be assembling handouts  containing the job descriptions taken from the relevant salary surveys which  I will send to each of you in advance of our Stage 2 meeting.  The intent  here is to give you the opportunity to "pre-match" your respective jobs  thereby minimizing the time required to achieve this objective during our  Stage 2 meeting.  It will be critical that you are comfortable with the  matches that you agree to as these matches will be used when gathering  relevant market data.  The data will only be as good as the matches.  Following the conclusion of Stage 2, I can begin gathering the market data  based on the results of the job matching exercise and prepare a comparative  analysis that I will be presenting to Sally Beck.  I will be contacting each of you in the next few days to set up the Stage 1  interviews.  I look forward to working with each of you and to the successful  completion of this project.  Please call with any questions or comments.  I can be reached at X39437.    Kind Regards,  Todd Burke ENA Compensation

From:  David Maxwell @ ECT                           09/19/2000 12:14 PM 	  To: Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Genoil addition to MPR  Shona  We have had issues in the past with Canada not informing us of all of their  Merchant investments.  For six months we chased Invasion Debt and finally  received enough information to put it on the MPR in August (only after it was  placed in Raptor I).  Also, about six months ago, John Lavorato asked about  an asset called CNR Warrants that showed up on the "hot list" but we were  told by Canada that they were going to sell it so they did not want it on the  MPR.  Today, we were told that Kyle Kitagawa wanted to sell an asset called  Genoil (approx. 4.7 million shares).  Again, we did not know that they owned  this investment.  We have contacted Donna Lowry about Genoil because Beau  Canada is on the restricted list and think Genoil would be, too.  A trip to Canada may be necessary in order to reinforce our full disclosure  policies regarding the MPR.  Please let me know if I can provide any  additional information.

beck-s	 As you know, now that we are nearly done in capturing the DPR numbers in the  database, we have been working to present the data in compelling ways.  We  have started to do this by creating the VaR Limit Usage graphs and the  Sharpe, Rovar, and Risk - Return graphs.    I am sorry for the misunderstanding with Ted concerning the latter.  I had  explained what I wanted to produce in an e-mail and during a Risk Forum  Luncheon.  Therefore, Shona and I did not expect the reaction we got.  I have  talked to Naveen and Rudi since then, and we have changed the graphs to be  agreeable to RAC.  Today I worked on the graphs below.  They show the P&L decomposition for the  month (rolling 20 business days) up to 9/20 (one in dollar terms and the  other as a percentage of P&L).  I showed them to Shona, and she thought you  should see them before Naveen, Rudi, and Ted, because these graphs are very  powerful and are likely to be controversial.  The graphs show that European  Gas and UK Power released a lot of prudency.  Half of total P&L for European  Gas is prudency, and UK Power would have had a loss of about $20 million  (instead of a gain of $27 million) were it not for prudency.   In the case of  North American Gas, $46 million gain in new deals partly offset about $106  million in trading losses.    Please note that these are rough drafts intended to show what we can do.  I  do not think that there are problems with the data, but I threw these  together today, and I have not yet double-checked the accuracy of my  aggregating calculations.  Please launch the attached spreadsheet, and feel free to call or page me with  questions or concerns.  Thank you,    Eugenio

beck-s	 Sally  I think the idea of finding  an efficient way to reference this effort as an  Enron-wide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all  locations and all commodities traded is great - and I would hope to reference  it via the reporting process that shona is trying to roll out.  I will work with Shona who undoubtedly would want to send out ( in your name  ) the global notification of our aims !  Mike       	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

I read your note back to Shona, and I understand John's desire to put a  reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the  need for operating standards.  If this is the best time to put that in  writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.  If there is an  efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define  and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded,  then that would be great.  It simply helps put the London initiative in the  context of an Enron-wide effort that we all feel is important.  --Sally     Mike Jordan 09/27/2000 02:58 AM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts  on the cover note ?    Comments in red       	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	From:  Sally Beck                           26/09/2000 23:57 	  To: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts  on the cover note ?    I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental  operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough  of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.  On  the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully  understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an Enron  publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if  so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an  introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies  if there is confusion )  With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around  fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in  nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in  trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we  will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we  will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in  operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable  Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined  requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the  article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.   Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity  to work on this with you and Shona )  Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent  drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this  was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston)  for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite  at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have  reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to  belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real  meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis  against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have  that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work  to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work  to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona  has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has  already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want  to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report  against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations  Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and  commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful  exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to  Shona  Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times  while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this  with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave  you some.  --Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks    Mike Jordan 09/26/2000 08:14 AM To: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts on  the cover note ?  Fernley  / Sally  Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page  communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page  summary ).  We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter  for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the  Enron Europe newsletter )  Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

beck-s	 Dear Shawn,  It is unfortunate Tom did not bring up these points when the three of us  discussed this on Monday.  I am unclear as to whether the work AA was  planning to do on power is for their internal or external purposes as when  asked directly Jennifer Stevenson said that it was for both audits (which, as  you know, is frowned upon by the SEC).  In fact, Stacey was not part of the Doorstep team.  Additionally Risk  Operations (myself) did not set up or perform the deal test.  Instead, this  test was set up by AA and performed by members of RAC.  This can be  considered a internal audit for AA's purposes.

beck-s	 We have all talked and are in agreement that financial confirms/settlements  are the responsibility of Kim Theriot.  Leslie is going to sent out a memo  discussing the organizational changes within that group that will clearly  communicate that message to all of wholesale.  Let me know if you have any  other questions.        	Enron North America Corp. 	 	From:  Sally Beck                           27/09/2000 15:35 	  To: Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Global Products - Houston Organizational Announcement  This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my  office regarding confirmations.  The language regarding Jeff's role on  financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.  It wasn't   clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at  a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.  Since you said  that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff  to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and  settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.  There  should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms  and settlements.  This memo as sent will create that confusion.  Thanks.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Sally Beck/HOU/ECT on 09/27/2000 03:07 PM  ---------------------------   Scott Earnest 09/27/2000 12:47 PM To: Anjali Abraham/NA/Enron@ENRON, Robert J Bonin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kara L  Boudreau/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt A Brown/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michelle Bruce/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Barbara Cain/NA/Enron@Enron, Olga Herrera/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark  Confer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Valarie Curry/NA/Enron@Enron, Tammie  Davis/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Jane Denson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Keynan  Dutton/NA/Enron@Enron, Diane Ellstrom/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Fondren/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Sue Foust/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alexia Gonzales/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Groves/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Bjorn Hagelmann/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Hayes/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Veronica  Hill/NA/Enron@Enron, Laura Karl/HOU/ECT@ECT, Nanette Kettler/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Christian LeBroc/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mark J Leskowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, James N  Lessor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda K Loukanis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Arlene  Mendieta/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard A Miley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Glenda D  Mitchell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary N Morris/NA/Enron@Enron, Michelle  Nelson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Frank G Newman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Frank  Prejean/HOU/ECT@ECT, Marilyn M Schoppe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michelle  Schultz/NA/Enron@ENRON, James Scully/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julia Sengele/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Shifali Sharma/NA/Enron@Enron, Lynn E Shivers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Shirley Gail  Sidler/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen Snow/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alicia  Solis/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patrick Stafford/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Leah  Stephens/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Shelly Stubbs/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kevin  Sweeney/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Swinney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michelle  Thomason/NA/Enron@Enron, Brandi Wachtendorf/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rhonda  Washington/HOU/ECT@ECT, Nicole White/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sony  Wilson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joan Winfrey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Andrea Bennett/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Shannon Cobb/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sharon Copley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael J  Gasper/HOU/ECT@ECT, John H Harrison/HOU/ECT@ECT, Helen M Jeschke/HOU/ECT@ECT,  George R Lachner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kristi I Louthan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ina  Norman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael Philips/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kathleen  Salerno/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jill Siekmeier/Corp/Enron@Enron, Angela  Stie/NA/Enron@Enron, Sharon Stringfellow/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tomas  Tellez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jackie Travis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lisa Walker/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent  A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chantelle Villanueva/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sheila  Glover/HOU/ECT@ECT, D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patti  Thompson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron, Michael E  Moscoso/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jefferson D Sorenson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill F  Briggs/HOU/ECT@ECT, David J Botchlett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phil Clifford/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rochelle Dent/NA/Enron@ENRON, Steven M  Elliott/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Engberg/HOU/ECT@ECT, Douglas S  Friedman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larry Gagliardi/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jim  Goughary/HOU/ECT@ECT, Adam Gross/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe King/HOU/ECT@ECT, Melinda  Joyce Lynn/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patrick Markey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lisa Nemec/HOU/ECT@ECT,  John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Fuller/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted  Robinson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Don Schroeder/HOU/ECT@ECT, S Craig Story/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Claude Straub/HOU/ECT@ECT, Helen Marie Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sameer  Vasudev/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Spencer Vosko/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vickie J  Weaver/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pavel Zadorozhny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Mahoney/LON/ECT@ECT,  John Chismar/SIN/ECT@ECT, Joel Bennett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Simon  Thurbin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cindy Horn/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael L  Brown/Corp/Enron@Enron, Yolanda Cordova-Gilbert/HOU/ECT@ECT, Marc De La  Roche/HOU/ECT@ECT, Delores Y Frenzel/Corp/Enron@Enron, Doug  Leach/HOU/ECT@ECT, Perla Montemayor/NA/Enron@Enron, Victor  Santos/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, David A Terlip/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:   Subject: Global Products - Houston Organizational Announcement  Based on the recent changes in Global Markets, specifically Global Products  and Coal, the follow organizational changes have been implemented.

beck-s	 Dear Mike,  Thank you for volunteering some of your leads to work with us on the upcoming  Doorstep reviews.  I have spoken with Sally and we think that in principle it  is a good idea to get your people involved on a world-wide basis - the more  resources we can use the better!  I have put together a schedule for Q4 00 - Q4 01 and would like to receive  proposed names from you allocated to individual doorstep reviews.   Attached is the latest draft of the Doorstep schedule.  Please let me know by  next Tuesday if there are Risk Operations spots you may be able to fill (any  with whom).  Also, as you are responsible for ensuring that the Enron Europe  (with the exception of London) doorsteps are performed, please let me know  which individuals you plan to allocate to these reviews.  Thanks,  Shona 
beck-s	 Currently, members of Ted Murphy's group have been preparing certain  non-standard reports at the request of commercial.  These reports can be  categorized as:  "morning report" - daily Component V@R - daily Adhoc V@R - as needed Book reconciliation - as needed Stress testing - as needed Back testing - weekly Correlation Matrix - bi-weekly   I have obtained a copy of all reports currently being prepared.  In the  upcoming weeks we need to transfer the preparation of these reports from RAC  to Risk Operations.  In order to do that, on a report by report basis, we  need to determine what group within Risk Operations should prepare these  reports (Risk Management and Controls or the individual commodity risk  management groups).  In the next couple days,  I will be sending you each a listing of reports  prepared, and then set up a time to meet with you so we can determine the  best way to go forward.  Best regards  Shona 
beck-s	 Based on my discussions with Sally, and her discussions with Ted and Rick  Carson, I've updated the process flows for Doorstep teams.

beck-s	 Here is the first draft of the strategy memo for Doorstep.

I base this on the success of Enron Online and Valtech's role of supporting that effort. Currently, We have the Architect (David Jayakaran) that designed the presentation framework for EOL available as part of the team. I mention this because of the obvious synergy between the EOL framework and Commodity Logic. As discussed David will meet with you on Wednesday. The action items I owe you are the Enron negotiated rate structure and profiles for consultants that could start immediately. The daily rates are senior consultants at $2,000 and consultants at $1,750.  The profiles are attached for your review. Please contact me if you have any questions.

beck-s	 Dear Lynn,  As it turns out, there is no deal documentation for the Panama City deals in  Panama (everything is in Houston).  Therefore, the deal test will need to be  done from Houston and we won't need anyone from your group to attend the  upcoming doorstep.  Scott and Michelle Bruce will obtain the population when  then are in Panama and also write the report.  Best regards  Shona 
beck-s	 Dear Sally,  As requested.    Best regards  Shona 
beck-s	 Sally,  Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and= =20 Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis= h=20 that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin= g=20 difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was= =20 available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any= =20 member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to= =20 explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set = it.  You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20 permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As= =20 you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting= =20 firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark= et=20 research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20 required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20 shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10= =20 years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm= s,=20 begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20 actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns= =20 until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,= =20 Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first= =20 year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui= t=20 in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for= =20 "spring" internships.  The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last= =20 year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &= =20 February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that= =20 did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope= . =20 We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20 because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.  Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s= ummer=20 interns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and= =20 40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20 summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20 assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20 offers to join Enron.  =20  The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20 summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20 undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20 particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms= =20 that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.  Because the=20 undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20 continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the= re=20 were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).  With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about= =20 which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y= ou=20 indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve= r,=20 provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken= =20 therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.  While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained= =20 from UT.  o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20 o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on= =20 campus conduct interviews in the fall for "summer" internships.  Cindy=20 attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring= ,=20 or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct= =20 all interviews  at one time. =20 o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting = on=20 campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.  We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t= he=20 statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such= =20 information. =20  It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20 different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20 individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for= =20 the discrepancies.  While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20 different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie= ve=20 that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20 supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20 already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview= =20 process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in= =20 most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by= =20 the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would= =20 like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this= =20 fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to= =20 support your efforts.  I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20 frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20 manager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i= f=20 you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20  Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20 interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance.

beck-s	 As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil= l=20 continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20 businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20 responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You= =01,ve=20 seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20 realize its benefits at home.  With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t= he=20 ClickAtHome program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20 technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the= =20 click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of= =20 Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20  We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide= =20 the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in= =20 case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home= =20 computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20 ClickAtHome includes the following:  ? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy= =20 disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000= =20 software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet= =20 connection, including broadband, where commercially available. ? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time= =20 and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;= =20 however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT= ,=20 Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20 accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20 employed at the time of implementation. =20 ? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of= =20 the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive= ry=20 of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.  Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of= =20 your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on= =20 http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne= ar=20 future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions.

beck-s	 Shona:  Thank you for your memo.  I think it is a good idea to define roles  and responsibilities and I appreciate the fact  that you have taken the  initiative to do so.  However, I do have the following comments:  1) I have some accountability to Rick Buy for the success of this effort,  therefore I (or my designee) need to be involved in Doorstep pre- planning  and post-mortem.  I will be involved in reviewing the final report before  presentation and will attend  the meeting when the report is presented to Buy  and Causey.  2) I realize that  in the interest of getting a review done timely it is  sometimes necessary to "divide and conquer".  However, where logistically  possible, I believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in  meetings held with Commercial personnel.  This facilitates understanding  operations, document flow, points of contact, report writing as well as  furthering our goal of educating "multi-functional" people so that we can  continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews.  3) There are still some detailed issues that need to be clarified regarding  the database.  Let's schedule another meeting with Cassandra and Donna.  Please let me know if you have any questions,         Regards,       Rick

beck-s	 Dear Rick,  Thanks for the update.  I appreciate your input as I do not know what your  discussions with Rick Buy have been.  To address your points below:  1)  I agree that your team should be involved in the planning of each  individual review although I am under the impression that Ted & Sally (by  proxy Cassandra and I) would set the scope & timing of the reviews while your  group would be looped in to the planning for each individual process.  If my  understanding is incorrect, please let me know.    2) I agree that it would be useful for everyone to attend all meetings.   However, due to the limited time we have from arriving at the doorstep to  delivery of the report to Ted and Sally, your group really has to be focused  on completing the deal test.    We don't need three different people  obtaining the same information at the same meetings.  If there has been a  change in your group's role from what I originally understood (we need lower  level people from your team who would be able to execute a deal test) , we  may have to add additional resources to do the actual deal test to ensure it  is done on time (by the time we leave the site).   3)  Agreed - I'd like to hear what Donna and Mike Neeves have resolved as far  as the database is concerned before we meet again.

beck-s	 Hi, Sally...  Wanted to apologize for the way I probably sounded on the phone--lots was going on here and you caught me at a brain-overload moment!  Thanks for sending the Enron article--thought it was great--brought it in to the office to show you off here...  Pictures of the girls were much appreciated--can't really believe how old they look.  Brigeda's has taken possession of them and put them on her bulletin board--although she wanted BIGGER ones like Grandmom--told her Grandmoms always got bigger ones....Brigeda gets her picture taken next week and will send you one--last year's was so dorky we didn't circulate them much...  Dad actually seemed better yesterday.  He was making jokes and his voice was a little stronger--he's on pain medication for his tongue--I think giving him something to make him relax really does help--he wasn't loopy just not quite so tense.   He seemed very "up" for the dr's appt in Houston.  I told him you asked Fabe for the best ENT in Houston and that this guy was in your church and did Meagan's tonsils.  He liked all of that information a lot...thanks again for arranging this.  Mom and I decided if anyone could get him to a doctor on short notice you would be able to do it--now the pressure is on!  Hope you have a great weekend--Brigeda and I are looking forward to see you guys next weekend.  Cindy

beck-s	 Please plan to attend the kick- off of the Process Leveraging and Reporting  teams, two of the seven teams that I introduced at the conference in San  Antonio.  This full-day meeting will begin at 8 am on Wednesday, October 18  at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 2222 West Loop South.  This is an important next  step in completing the SAP implementation and achieving the benefits that we  identified before Project Apollo and Beyond began.   The objectives of this meeting will be 1) to identify management's  information needs and priorities related to the accounting and reporting  processes and 2) to prioritize and focus the efforts of the Process  Leveraging and Reporting teams based on management's needs and priorities.   Therefore, it is very important for you to attend, to ensure that your BU's  needs and priorities are considered in these projects.  I realize that this  is a very busy time, but it will probably continue to be busy through yearend  close.  If we can get started as soon as possible, it is my hope that we can  complete the projects and see the results soon, possibly by the January close.  Attached is a list of questions and other information that you should  assemble and bring with you to the meeting so that we can make  better-informed decisions.  We will collect your completed information sheets  to use for further analysis and follow-up after the meeting.  If you have  questions in completing the pre-work items, please contact Jan Johnson at  x33260.   A preliminary agenda is also attached.   Please plan to attend the entire  day, as individual segments of the agenda will not make sense without full  participation  Please RSVP to Dortha Gray (x35903) by tomorrow at 2pm.  A continental  breakfast and buffet lunch will be provided.  If you are unable to attend,  let me know who will represent you.  Thanks for your help.    
beck-s	 Dear Mike,  Thanks for your insight.  In the past few months we have established a  detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM.  Through  my calls the past week, I've been trying to update you so we can determine  how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work, as well as get an understanding  of what resources you can supply for this global initiative.  My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to  determine their skill set and what locations/commodities they'd be best to  work on.  I'll send you an updated schedule once I've finalized this.  Thanks  Shona      Mike Jordan@ECT 10/11/2000 09:37 AM To: Shawn Kilchrist/NA/Enron@Enron, Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an  internal approach to internal audit  Shawn / Shona  We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to  take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need  to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-  Aims Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support  teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams. A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive  on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking. Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully  leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused  by it All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control  should generate defined output We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and  origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading  offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our  labelling for each office) The output from Enron's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be  discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and  at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list  must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have  different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced  staff  The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion  based upon our database and our review and management process of it  Trading Process - monthly Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction  cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend  indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full  listing Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see  attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment  2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not  solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the  work that Mike Moscoso is leading Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss  operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of  action plans for such areas Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high  (red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action  plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if  the risk rating for any remote offices has changed All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or  BRM completion populated into database Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and  decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment  Process - Yearly Planning Checkpoint taken of current operational environment (say end Oct) proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in  office, and IT development plans for next year Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what  depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to  end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review  of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the  review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding  on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level' Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require  external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and  doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal  governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that  assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure  management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management  controls/process  Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately  We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I  am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston  offsite do this? 23rd Oct The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as  senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep  databases - November Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate  the database from scratch - November Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and  remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to  visit all? - November Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning -  end November to end December !!

beck-s	 Shawn / Shona  We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to  take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need  to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-  Aims Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support  teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams. A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive  on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking. Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully  leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused  by it All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control  should generate defined output We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and  origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading  offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our  labelling for each office) The output from Enron's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be  discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and  at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list  must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have  different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced  staff  The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion  based upon our database and our review and management process of it  Trading Process - monthly Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction  cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend  indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full  listing Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see  attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment  2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not  solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the  work that Mike Moscoso is leading Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss  operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of  action plans for such areas Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high  (red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.

beck-s	 Shona  A few comments :  As discussed it may be useful to see how the doorstep and BRM approaches  interact - anything written down that explains it ?  I am going to proceed with driving accountability for op risk assessment to  my controllers - we should discuss at the global offsite if it is worth  formalising this process - I am totally open to ideas on this.  Lastly, in conversations with Shawn we agreed to delay the full planning for  European BRM 2001 whilst we finalise this years reports ( lots of activity  due in October )  Thanks for the call yesterday  Mike        	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

In the past few months we have established a  detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM.  Through  my calls the past week, I've been trying to update you so we can determine  how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work, as well as get an understanding  of what resources you can supply for this global initiative.  My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to  determine their skill set and what locations/commodities they'd be best to  work on.  I'll send you an updated schedule once I've finalized this.

beck-s	 Sarah, Below is our high level explanation of the Energy Operations (including EOL)  increase in 2001 plan over 2000 forecast of $5.1 million.  If you have any  questions, please let me know.   Energy Operations has experienced a 140% increase in transaction growth as a  result of EOL activity, requiring additional resources to support this new  business.  However, resources have only increased at a rate of 11% due to the  efficient use of existing resources.  As a result the per unit cost of  supporting individual transactions has decreased significantly in the 100% to  400%+ range.   Thanks, Brian 
beck-s	 Here's just a quick summary of what we have going on...(not sure how quick  this is going to be!)  EnronOnline Offering products on other exchanges (HoustonStreet and True Quote).  We are  going to offer specific products (various Gas and Power products) to  customers who have execute rights to these products on these two platforms.   Therefore, we will have three feeds to deal with and will need new  applications built to support the interfaces.  We will be responsible for  adding/deleting products, ensuring the sites match ours, reporting trades on  these systems, bridging applicable data to downstream systems, etc.  Enron  gets an equity ownership in the platforms depending on activity. Opening up EnronOnline to brokers.  We are negotiating with three brokers  right now.  They will have to pay a one year licensing fee to have access to  the site, and we will allow them to transact for specific counterparties  only.  We will also need applications built and establish specific processes  to support this. Wish List - we have a list of approx. 180 times that we need the developers  to work on for us.  Jay Webb committed to Louise a few weeks back (when I was  in her office) that we would get a resource (specifically Chris Luttrel and  his team).  I think you are aware of this.  Chris is now moving on to do  something else and none of our items have been addressed in three weeks.  We  have had weekly meetings the last three weeks with the IT team (Mark Dilworth  and company...).  Basically, since Mark has decided to leave the group,  nothing is being addressed.  I am going to speak to Dave tomorrow about this  and escalate from there necessary.  This needs a more detailed explanation -  I am going to try to get some time with you next week. Steel - I will discuss with Dave tomorrow.  He basically told me not to do  anything (another topic of discussion....) We are working on enhancing our existing intranet site for the PCG Louise has asked that I not allocate any of the PCG time to Europe - I don't  agree with this because I have four people preparing the management report on  a daily basis and I have a call center that also supports Europe.  I tried to  argue my point but did not get very far : )  I am going to talk to Dave about  it some more. Working on bridging to Thunderball and the new weather application Legal/Credit - we do not always get timely responses from the groups - Credit  is improving (they hired a new person), but Legal has one person responsible  for new CP set up (Tana Jones).  When she is out, all application processing  stops.  I am going to talk to Mark Taylor about appointing a back up at a  minimum.  Tana does a great job, but our activity is really increasing (she  also supports Clickpaper), so it is becoming an issue. We have set another record today - we have already done 3,358 trades!!!! No new news from Canada on power trading - Legal needs to sign off.  In Mark  Taylor's shop Argentina in the works - probably end of month.   Clickpaper We have so much, I am not sure where to start.  I had lunch today with Jeff  Harbert to discuss what our needs were.  We need tools from reporting to  credit...   The commercial group is really wanting to start offering more products, and  are starting to hire marketing people and traders.  The activity is really  picking up The contractors are working weekends (Call Center).  I am working the  Commercial group to discontinue this.  We are not even getting that many  calls during the week, and we have not received one call on Sat/Sun since  launch (July)  Commodity Logic Dale has been very involved in all the discussions and has been a great  resource (I have received several compliments from the NetWorks team on his  contribution) They have not yet released the first module (Financial Mgmt - CFO).  Should  be very soon  DealBench No external customers - very slow developing....  Staying involved and in  touch with the Commercial team  Other I am still looking for an assistant.  I sent five resumes down to staffing  and a week later the interviews were not scheduled.  I went down to complain  and two of them were scheduled.   A week later, the other three were yet to  be scheduled, so I am doing it myself.  I think we have some real issues in  the staffing group - this is not the first time. We are working on Disaster Recovery for the group.   Super Saturday - I would like our team to participate.  Do you have an idea  of who all is interviewing?  We would like to be involved. We are looking at holiday coverage now to ensure we have coverage I talked to Mary Sloan (SAP) and Keith Clark (Call Center) is working with  her.  I think she really appreciates the help/input.   Have you had a chance to review the announcement letter re:reorg?   Sorry for the long-winded  message.... Thanks!  Talk to you soon. Sheri

beck-s	 The SITARA system will be brought down  Saturday evening  (Oct 14 - 8 PM  Central Time) to move the system to a new machine.   The system will be available late Saturday, at approximately 11 PM.  CPR will be available during this time.  Please call the SITARA/CPR Hotline ((713)-853-7049) if you have any questions  or concerns. 
beck-s	 Sally,  Shari and I would like to schedule an hour of your time from 3:00 pm to 4:00  pm on Wednesday, October 25, 2000.  During this time Shari will present to  you the September results for the Operations Pricing Model.  We would also  like to give you a briefing of the overall status of the project.  Let me know if this is a good time.  Thanks. 
beck-s	 IN THE SPIRIT OF LET US MAKE IT BETTER - NOT IN TED IS CHUCKING BLAME AROUND,  PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING ISSUE:  At the Audit Comittee Meeting, Jeff made the comment that the number of and  timing of the limit notifications caused them to be meaningless.  Now part of  that was an attempt by him to diffuse the number of notifications represented  graphically, but I think that there is an element of truth, particularly of  late.  therefore, I propose that we work toward making that timing faster and  the impact more meaningful.    I think the following might help: 1) Cassandra will be our point person, therefore it will be faster than  waiting for the slower, more distracted and less organized ME 2) I will propose that we raise the threshholds for notifications,  particularly at Jeff's level - I think that the sheer volume makes an  impression on Rick. Unfortunately, I think that it will not be in effect  until after the Dec bd meeting.  FYI I have proposed this at least twice and  have been shot down by Greg and Rick, but now that a smart guy is proposing  it, it will probably get more attention. 3) We should use the executive report viewer as the mechanism for delivery.   I do not know who actually supports that thing so please let me know.  It has been important to AA for audit purposes to see "evidence" that Rick,  Jeff, Ken and Bd received appropriate notification - so that needs to be  considered. Another possibility would be RisktRAC.  The 3-d solution contracted for  contains an "Executive View" of "hot spots" .  Unfortunately, even though  Jeff requested it on his desk top 5 months ago, we can't get the IT resources  to pay attention to it.  IT however, has been interviewed several times for  magazines and have created such incredibly successful and useful products  such as EnergyDesk.com, Credit.com, En-lighten,  .............................................................................. ..    Conceptually, Notifications should take place before trading begins the next day.  This may  be utopian, but it is fundamentally correct (just because Enron doesn't know  it is supposed to, doesn't make it right).  I am certain that real risk  management organizations have a mechanism in place for this.   It  may be  necessary to create a SWAG process that is lightning fast with a more exact  process to follow.  Please have fixed by close of business today.  Ted 
beck-s	 I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM.   However, I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m., which is too  late into the trading day.  Please let me know if there are resources you  need, so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas.    Thanks.  Jeff 
beck-s	 This goes to a discussion I had with Jeff this morning.  We have had IT  problems of some sort or another every day this week which has prevented us  from getting the daily reports out by 8:30 (our target time with Jeff).  I  have talked to Steve Stock and Richard Burchfield and have been trying to  reach Beth for a few days to determine what can be done from an IT  perspective.  The problem is that it is not the same thing but has been a  different problem every day (metacalc, servers going down, Lotus Notes  problems...).  I will talk to Beth and let you know if we need to escalate.   I would hope she would dedicate the appropriate resources to ensure that  these problems do not continue.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Brent A Price/HOU/ECT on 13/10/2000 09:47  ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Jeffrey A Shankman                           13/10/2000 09:06 	  To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A  Price/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject:   I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM.

beck-s	 Dear Naomi,  As always - good talking to you yesterday.  Based on the discussions you and  I have had recently, Cassandra and I are in the process of drafting a process  whereby we receive information from you and your group to help update our  understanding of the Enron Europe remote offices.  This will allow us to  better determine which offices to scope into the doorstep review and  hopefully lessen the doorstep work required from Mike's resources.  I'll send something to you early next week.  Have a good weekend,  Shona

beck-s	 Dear Sally,  Just to keep you in the loop, Naomi's group is responsible for all of the  Enron Europe remote offices and is a great resource to keep us updated on  what each office is really doing.  We are hoping her group can help us  determine which offices have origination/trading or are near doing these  types of activities, as well as what offices have other activities.  We are putting together a short checklist that her team will fill out for  each office.  Based on that, we can determine whether to scope the office  into our doorstep review.

Based on the discussions you and  I have had recently, Cassandra and I are in the process of drafting a process  whereby we receive information from you and your group to help update our  understanding of the Enron Europe remote offices.  This will allow us to  better determine which offices to scope into the doorstep review and  hopefully lessen the doorstep work required from Mike's resources.  I'll send something to you early next week.  Have a good weekend,  Shona

beck-s	 Sally,  Following our Doorstep meeting today, I am following up on your request that  I forward to you the list of Portland transactions for which we still require  documentation, e.g. invoices, SAP entries, etc.  For the Settlements testing  only, we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly-selected  transactions, in order to facilitate the Settlement group's ability to  complete both its monthly close obligations and our Doorstep request.  The  deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green.     Also per your request, attached are the five "non-standard" deals for which  we have been unable to obtain any information at all.  Our primary need is  just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.

beck-s	 I'm not one for announcements, but the word appears to be out to varying  degrees, so here is my first cut at clarifying the situation. Prmary  distribution would be Enron Europe, but your thoughts on content and  distribution would be welcome.  Thanks  Fernley     "Many of you will be aware of some recent and forthcoming appointments within  commercial support in Enron Europe. Enron's rapid growth and the ability of  our people to use their skills in different roles make this a dynamic  process, but I have taken this opportunity to summarise changes at a senior  level in our tax, accounting and transaction support groups.  Peter Hutton has joined us as Vice President, Head of US Tax, reporting to  Rod Sayers.  Peter was previously a partner in Arthur Anderson and will be  transitioning in to his new role over the next few months. Jim Sandt  will be taking up a senior role with the Tax Department in Houston  early in the new year.  Melissa Allen is to join us shortly as Vice President, Head of Financial  Operations and Transaction Support, reporting to me. Melissa needs no  introduction to many of you, as she has worked with Enron Europe as a senior  manager in Arthur Anderson for the past 18 months.  Beth Apollo will be returning to Houston in the early part of next year to  take up a senior role in Enron North America's Energy Operations group.  Phillip Lord is transitioning in to his new Houston - based role as Chief  Accounting Officer for Enron Broadband Services.  Buddy Aiken and Stephen Wood will be taking on the lead roles in Transaction  Support and Financial Operations respectively, reporting to Melissa Allen.  I am sure you will join me in welcoming Peter and Melissa to Enron, in  congratulating Jim, Beth, Phillip, Buddy and Stephen, and wishing them all  well in their new roles"

beck-s	 Hiring Managers,   Here are a few tips that will immediately improve the time it takes to make a  offer to your candidates.     All applicants must fill out and sign an Application and a Fair Credit  Reporting Act form (included with the application) prior to being  interviewed.   You may either have the applicant fill out a form before you  interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36th floor to fill out  the forms before you interview them.      Notify Hector McLoughlin or Frank deJesus if you are interviewing an external  candidate that is a former Enron employee.    All previous Enron employees  will be reviewed by HR and Sally Beck prior to being invited to interview.    We hope that this process will eliminate re-hiring poor performers.  If you want to make an offer of employment to a candidate for a Management  Position, please include Sally Beck in the process for input.    As a final  step of the selection process, Sally would like to meet with the candidate if  time allows or to phone interview the candidate as an alternative.    Sally's  involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a  potential Management new hire.   Thanks for your help with this process.    ENA Energy Ops Human Resources Team

How does this meeting relate to  the requirements gathering already done / being done by Commodity Logic? Isn't this a somewhat redundant effort, albeit a more organized approach?  In  other words, why would we start a second effort without coordinating it with  the Commodity Logic effort ?  Are you in competition or something?  Additionally, I should inform you that a company called ConfirmCorp offers a  service for confirm clearing.  They are coming in Tuesday afternoon to make a  presentation.

beck-s	 Mary,  Thanks for your interest, I will add you.  The meeting arose out of a need to identify where clearing needs to be in the  future.  Legal will address the legal implications of confirming web based deals.  It was rumored at one  time that the web based receipt  was sufficient for confirmation of the  deal.    This issue as well as many others will be discussed.  Clearing users from London, Calgary, and Houston will have a chance to  present their requirements. These requirements will  include a need for web based clearing,  the nature of which  Commodity Logic is  developing.  We are currently working closely with the Commodity Logic  project  in order to assure that the entire process of clearing deals as it exists today   can be made as efficient as possible.  Web based clearing will be one of many requirements we hope to flush out  during these meetings,  Based on the requirements we will work with London to develop a plan that get us where we need to be.  Thanks for the invite, I will try and make it.

How does this meeting relate to  the requirements gathering already done / being done by Commodity Logic? Isn't this a somewhat redundant effort, albeit a more organized approach?  In  other words, why would we start a second effort without coordinating it with  the Commodity Logic effort ?  Are you in competition or something?  Additionally, I should inform you that a company called ConfirmCorp offers a  service for confirm clearing.  They are coming in Tuesday afternoon to make a  presentation.  It's probably a good idea if you attend.  The meeting is in  49c4.  I will call you with additional information.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT on 10/20/2000  05:14 PM ---------------------------                             	 	Enron Technology 	 	From:  Tommy J Yanowski                           10/20/2000 01:22 PM 	  To: Mary Solmonson cc:   Subject: Clearing User Meetings  Mary:  You may want to get plugged into this as well.

We have invited interested parties from London, Calgary and Houston.  Folks  from Clearing, Legal, Credit, Commodity Logic, and LiveLink have been invited.  We are asking Legal to clearly define the legal implications of web trading.   We expect Web based clearing to be a hot topic; CommodityLogic can represent a piece to the clearing puzzle.  Attached is a tentative agenda.  Let me know if you have any ideas for making  this as productive as possible.

beck-s	 Hi Shona,  Thanks for the update - I was out late last week for the RAC Conference.  Although the urgency of the situation was stressed when requesting this  information, we followed up with an email on October 10 to Dan Houston  (attached below) when it appeared that they would not be able to provide us  with the information - the email gives an overview of the project and  stresses the urgency that we obtain the documentation.  As you note that the information was there, have you already completed this  portion of the deal test?  If not, and you would like for us to complete it,  would you have the documentation sent to me at 3AC1904?  I have not heard anything from Pam regarding a meeting, but today looks  good.  Tomorrow and Wednesday I will be in L.A.  Thanks, Shona, Ken ---------------------- Forwarded by Kenneth Horton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on  10/23/2000 07:19 AM ---------------------------   Kenneth Horton 10/12/2000 02:22 PM To: dan.houston@enron.com cc:    Subject: Doorstep - Settlements  Dan,  The RAC group is currently involved in project Doorstep, which includes a  review of Enron's trading activities worldwide.  Part of the review includes  a deal test for each office,  in which we follow a transaction from inception  through the settlements process.  Kyle Gibson has helped us with the settlements by providing some invoices and  G/L entries for selected transactions.  In fact, given the deadline Kyle  indicated to us regarding his own group's close, we reduced the deal  population in half with the hope of concluding our testing by today.  We  understand that the monthly close will prevent Kyle from helping us any  further until tomorrow at noon at the earliest, and that he will be absent  this afternoon.  Given the large number of trading offices worldwide, each "Doorstep" is of  very short duration.  In fact, part of the testing evaluates the ability of a  group to pull together all of the supporting documentation for a selection of  deals within a short time frame.  Given the "short fuse," we must finalize  our report tomorrow at the latest, and present it on Monday to Sally Beck,  Ted Murphy, Rick Buy, and Rick Carson among others.  It is important that we be able to mention in this report that the  settlements group is able to gather this information quickly for a small  number of transactions (10 overall - although some information has already  been provided by Kyle).  Are there any other resources in your group who  would be able to help us meet this deadline?

As a  result, I think we have to rewrite the information related to this issue in  the Portland report.  Let's get together for 15 minutes today/tomorrow to  draft a rewrite of these areas.    Just as a side note, we need to wait until the report has been changed before  we share the information with Portland.  Pam - could you organize Ken, Leslie and I getting together?  Thanks  Shona

beck-s	 Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very  interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is  too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects  all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally  announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.  I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is  headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing  from her.   I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come  over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your  team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you  suggested.  Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in  the month, so people will generally be around.   Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to  spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE  Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with  the North America group.   What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!  Beth

beck-s	 Sally, I received your voicemail this morning and I believe the following will  answer all your questions:  1.  We are actually fine on Friday night dinners and really only need  interviewers at this time.  2.  For the first weekend - Oct. 28th - To date, I don't see that anyone from  your area has signed up to interview.  This may be because this is an  Associate weekend.  3.  For the second weekend - Nov. 4th - The only person signed up is Pat  Clynes from Logistics.  The second weekend is really large and we still need  about 67 interviewers.  We are looking for Managers and above to interview.   4.  Attending schools  October 28th - approx. 55 students (Associate)      Georgetown     Rice - Grad     Michigan     Thunderbird     UT- Grad      November 4th - approx. 100 students (Analyst)     UT- Undergrad     A&M     Baylor     Rice - Undergrad     Oklahoma     Florida  5.  Interviewers must check in at 8:00am for interview discussion and  breakfast - 50M.  They will pick up their schedule and candidate resumes at  this time.  6.  Interviewers will see 5 candidates and will be assigned to a interview  team.  Interviews will be conducted between 8:45 - 12:15.  7.  Interviewer/Candidate lunch will be from 12:30-1:30 - The Energizer  8.  The decision making meeting will begin at 1:30pm in 5C2.  All  interviewers must attend the decision making meeting.

beck-s	 	 	 	 	 As all of you know we are in the midst of the Fall recruitment process for  the Analyst and Associate Program - the Super Saturday process.  A major part  of the process is the Saturday interview which has been changed this year.   Interviewers now only review five candidates and the "offer " decision is now  completed on the same day as the interview.  This decision process is  facilitated by a member of Enron's executive committee and should be  completed by 3:30 pm.  ENA is one of the major users of the Analyst and  Associate pool and needs to be well represented at Super Saturday (which we  are not at this time).  The Program still needs additional interviewers and  the Office of the Chairman of ENA needs you to support the Program and the  interview process.  Signing up is now easier than ever and all you need to do  is access the following web site and fill in a few blanks.  The web site is  as follows:  http://axis.enron.com/notice/ssinvite.asp.  The dates of Super  Saturday's are listed below:         Associates:   Analysts:      October 28   November 4      November 11   November 18      December 2   December 9      December 15  The selection of qualified candidates is important to ENA  and Enron.  Your  participation is needed, now especially for the October 28th and November 4th  dates.  Please respond accordingly.   Thanks, Ted

If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so  this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We  had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.   Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you  have heard anything on this.        
beck-s	 Andy, thanks for the update and your help in articulating this issue to the  commercial team Ted 
beck-s	 Hello Team,  There has been some revisions to the Reception and Interview dates.  Please  look at the event form for the details.    I have attached the strategy also for your convenience.  Geynille 
beck-s	 The good news is that September VaRs are little changed from the June numbers.  The bad news is that the New Power Company went public in October.  The stock  is very volatile (about 180% per year).  The warrants we inserted into the  Hawaii 125-0 McGarret swaps are hugely in the money and will therefore have  substantial VaR.   VaR for the total return swaps will probably be over $30  million in October.   Additionally, you will notice a huge trading commodities VaR for August ($79  million).  This will require some explanation when we report high monthly VaR  at year-end.  Regards,    Eugenio 
beck-s	 Please find attached the EGM Management Summary and Hot List as of 10/26.   Please contact me if you have any questions/comments.

beck-s	 Dear Eugenio,  I did not want to say this when everyone else was around, but I am concerned  that no attempt was made to meet the deadline of this morning that we  discussed last Friday. (to decide on a name for the database).  Only Maria  Teresa had her information to me this am as requested. The deadline could  have been easily met by working diligently this morning, but Jennifer did not  come in until 8:30 and MT until 8:15.  I thought we had discussed the urgency of this - to have something to present  at the 10am meeting.  We need to discuss this to ensure it does not happen  again.  Best regards  Shona 
beck-s	 Dear Milind, Heidi,  I haven't heard from you in a while and thought I'd drope you a line.  I  heard today that there are some people from India who have come to Houston to  learn about VAR as they are planning to start trading around our assets there  (Anshuman Srivastav/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shubh  Shrivastava/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Pinnamaneni Krishnarao@ECT,  Rajesh Sivaraman/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Amr  Ibrahim/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT).  Could you fill me in on the status?  Thanks 
beck-s	 I have just returned to the office, and am making it through my E-mails  gradually.  It seems that Clickpaper.com is the concern of this memo.  I am  not up to speed on this European effort.  I suggest this:  I would suggest a  conference call to discuss.  I would also like for Clickpapaer to be there,  so if you provide me a name of your Clickpapaer contact, I'll make sure they  are included.  Also please provide an assistant's name, and I'll have Yvette  schedule the call.  In the meantime, I'll talk with the Clickpaper people here to get up to speed  on their plans.

beck-s	 Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.   As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two  day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be  discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian  in Las Vegas.  This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard  and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage  everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we  would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.  ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.  Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.    Regards Dave and John 
beck-s	 Sally,  Per Dorie, there will be an interactive invitation to Office of the Chair  offsite (probably the beginning of next week).  With a click, you will RSVP &  indicate whether or not you need airline reservations.  If so, you will be  forwarded to a travel agent who has been selected to make these  reservations.  Do you want me to make back-up reservations just in case  preferable flights get booked early?

I think I will still plan to come --  as I can handle some of my personal things re: moving home -- house etc.  on  Thursday Friday and meet up with others on Wed.  So ---- go ahead and pencil me in for Mon and Tuesday the 13th and 14th.  I will assume that you and Patti will mostly fill my calendar on those two  days, so will have Janine put other meetings the rest of that week.  Will check on the agenda next week, before I leave London.  Thanks  Beth       	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Fernley has decided that it is  too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects  all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally  announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.  I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is  headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing  from her.   I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come  over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your  team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you  suggested.  Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in  the month, so people will generally be around.   Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to  spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE  Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with  the North America group.   What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!  Beth

beck-s	 Hi, Sal.  Just saying hello.  Hope your interviews at OU went well.   You are quite the interviewing queen!  Maybe you should write a book (or article) sometime on "Keys to Snagging the Right Employee!".  Good news about Dad, huh?   So glad you were able to get him to see your doctor to start the ball rolling on finding new answers for him.   It is a lot of work to find the right answers for our healthcare!  We are starting to think more about the baby's room . . .  I think we're leaning towards using your bed, if that's still okay.   Did you say that the changing table would be available, too?  Is it light wood also? I think we will probably get our own bed linens - but what do your look like?   Boyish?   Do you think it's better to use a rocker or a glider?  Sorry we didn't make it for a fall trip.   It seems that almost every weekend one of us has been gone - Chris leaves for Asia on Thursday for 2 weeks - it's a nonstop whirlwind of travel!  Thanksgiving should be fun . . . what shall we bring?     Is there any sort of a plan for Friday?  I had my monthly doctor's appointment today:  the baby is still in there and her mom is getting very fat!  I have really enjoyed my Halloween nutcracker this season!

beck-s	 Shona  Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the  transparency and accountability of issues raised.   After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient'  if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin  report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the  office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from  the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get  an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we  could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a  doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their  individual reviews next year ) -will call later  Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down   Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns  identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems  improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate  that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date.  Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict  systematically with the above instructions All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls  exist and function in NY Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business  communications on roles and responsibilities Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and  monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens  Will call later  Mike

beck-s	 See the comment below on Williams' confirmation site.  Sounds similar to what  we are proposing on CL.  One question I'm exploring right now is whether we  could save more money from an Enron perspective and achieve greater  marketability with the model that ConfirmCorp proposes with automated  matching vs. the Commodity Logic/Williams approach that depends on users  reviewing/approving confirms (we've simply put the current process online so  to speak).  We need to push for a more radical change/improvement on a faster  timeline.   I still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on,  as I mentioned in our meeting with Louise, but we need to seriously review  what we propose to deliver and how.  Is ConfirmCorp a viable company to bring  under the Enron umbrella?  I think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will  erode our ability to sign up customers.  I don't think each large marketer  will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each  of their large counterparties.  Can we find out if Williams has further plans for their service that would  compete with Commodity Logic?  ---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT on 11/07/2000  03:08 PM ---------------------------   "Chris Papousek" <cep@confirmcorp.com> on 11/07/2000 11:10:15 AM Please respond to <cep@confirmcorp.com> To: <ron.nolte@enron.com> cc: <mary.solmonson@enron.com>  Subject: ConfirmCorp Info   Dear Ron:  I recently sent you information relating to ConfirmCorp via FedEx.

Regards,  Chris Papousek President, Confirmation Clearing Corporation (713)526-3000  PS Williams Energy just came out with "Williams CustomerFirst", a website  that contains all their confirmations.  While eliminating faxes, this puts  the onus of verification on the counterparty and assumes there is a  confirmation staff on the other end to do the checkout.  ConfirmCorp will  make even this advanced approach obsolete.

I just spoke with Lou Santorie with Sempra.  He said that they are very  interested in Confirm Corp and would be looking for a company to partner  with.  He said that basically "if Enron would decide to use this application"  that the industry would have to get on board...basically sounds like he feels  that we would set the stage for what is used in the industry as far a  clearing applications.  We had a brainstorming meeting with the Commodity Logic team at  lunch....their concepts are good for Phase I but we would get the biggest  bang from their later Phase concept where they intend to do the automatching  of deal info. between us and the Counterparty......

We will have  several large tables set up and would like to have at least 1 Enron  representative at each table to facilitate conversation.    The group will depart from Houston by approximately 3:45 to head for College  Station for the BIG GAME!!!!!  Thank you in advance for your help.

beck-s	 David,  The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with  one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the  sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any  customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales  person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day,  then they will be red carded.  I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised  traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with  Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as  well as Marcelo's operational plan.

beck-s	 Sally,  Chris Hanz has blocked his entire day out today for technology recruiting -  therefore he said that he would be able to meet with John from 1:30 - 2:00  just before a recruiting event for office visits at 2:00.

I told Dale that I would forward it to you and that I was  sure that you would appreciate the feedback.     You may want to use it as part of your PEP evaluation.

beck-s	 Mike,   Please find attached  a status and time line of doorstep issues identified by  Shona Wilson and the RAC group.  Note that some specific implementation dates have not been provided by  responsible parties a of today.  I have asked respective responsible parties  for specific dates and will update schedule attached as I receive the  information.   Further note that IT drives many of our critical dates.  Since our last  meeting we have been advised that any AS 400 system changes will not be  considered top priority as the IT team will focus on the off balance sheet  financing that must be in place by calendar year end.  Also, with the London  SAP implementation pushed off until April 2001, the credit aggregation system  will not be available until such time.  Please let me know if you have nay questions or comments to the attached.

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient'  if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin  report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the  office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from  the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get  an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we  could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a  doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their  individual reviews next year ) -will call later  Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down   Marcelo and yourself to identify/communciate the specific control concerns  identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered Marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems  improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all 'doorstep' issues Tim to send details of outward bound Commercial instructions and to validate  that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date.  Marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict  systematically with the above instructions All to prepare for full NY review so as to validate compensating controls  exist and function in NY Marcelo / Me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business  communications on roles and responsibilities Myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and  monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens  Will call later  Mike

beck-s	 Ladies and Gentlemen,  Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee.   I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate  Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all  important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time  with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking  about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any  questions you may have.  To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday,  November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person  and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged.   Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.  I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for  spending your time on this critical process.  Jeff 
beck-s	 The FIX module v1.0 is now operational and meets all the specifications as  shown in the FRS.  The team would be happy to show you a demo at your  convenience, perhaps early next week.  We anticipate our back office using  FIX in parallel with existing systems for December 2000, and then using FIX  "under fire" for January 2001 invoices.  The demo uses actual data from Sempra, our largest volume natgas financial  counterparty.  In about a minute, FIX is able to compare Enron data and  Sempra data (received electronically as an excel spreadsheet and stored on a  mini version of our Deal Database), immediately matching about 1450 of the  1500 deals.  It then helps the user to manually match those 50 deals that the  primary match engine could not.  This whole process, if it were purely  manual, would take more than a day.  Using excel spreadsheets (and sort  functions), Enron currently spends 4 to 8 hours per month matching Sempra  invoices. FIX allows the user to perform all matching in about 10 minutes.  Our next deliverable is the Confirm Central module v1.0, due 1 December.  We  anticipate delivering it on time, as we have with FIX.   All the best,  Tom

The RAC group insists that recording  is done ASAP and I need to report back to Marcelo the install dates of the  equipment in Montreal and St. Louis.  If you have such info or know who is  responsible, please let me know.        I understand that we are several months away from the installation of a  new switch with central recording capability here at the 520 Madison office  in New York.   As an alternative, I can install a refurbished digital  recording system for 24 telephones on the Concentrates and Metals trading  desks for approximately $45,000.   The recording device will be located in  our telephone room and is not accessible to the traders.  All equipment is in  stock and we can have the desks recorded by December 1.   I need a quick  approval since the vendor will only hold refurbished equipment until Friday  afternoon for us.  Barry, can you give the OK?     Also, recording for the Chicago office should not be an issue since the  Enron Metals people are moving to the existing Enron Chicago facilities  before the end of the year.

Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...  Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location  (bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this,  I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the  following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will  continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.  There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance,  however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a  production environment that will eventually need to be split.  Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the  trigger on this...

beck-s	 Due to the Thanksgiving Holiday in the U.S., the NYMEX and equity markets  will be closed on Thursday the 23rd and the NYMEX will be closed on Friday  the 24th.  The consolidated DPR will report the 22nd's data on Monday the  27th.  Additionally, the data for Thursday and Friday will be combined into  one consolidated DPR and also reported on the 27th.  Although the reporting  for Thursday the 23rd and Friday the 24th are combined into one daily  position report, violations will still be reported based on daily information.  Please continue to export your data as in the past.  We will need the data  for each day separated and not combined for Thursday and Friday due to the  need to assess the information against limits.  However, if your market is  closed and there is no trading for the day, we do not need an export.  Please call me with any questions or comments X39123. 
beck-s	 From the Risk Management perspective I would like to add the following  comments :  UK Power - despite much testing we still have a few production teething  problems with the transfer to Enpower and this was the first full live day.  The specific issues surrounding the o30m adjustment is being investigated by  IT and we hope to have a definitive answer tomorrow.  Continental Power - the Portcalc valuation failed 4 times as a result of IT  problems resulting is us missing the deadline.  Oslo - the officialisation was at 10.56 London time against a deadline of  11.00.

UK Power:  (despite the spotlight  being on this feed due to the first run of  the new evaluation system) was officialised late and required the below  mentioned adjustment.  Contintental Power : Officialised late ?  Nordic Power : was officialised around 11am London time - the slowness of the  current feed to Houston prevented the feed reaching there on time (feed has  been rewritten by IT to speed up the process  and is currently in UAT)  however, it appears the normal time for officialisation this book is around  10.30am which allows the feed to hit to normally hit on time.

beck-s	 In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books  have not been followed by everyone.   The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set  up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk  management (for each commodity group), "risk management"  is responsible for  ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation  systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have  all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of  RisktRAC).  I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of  this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy.   The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:  Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new  curve set up Trader communicates this to risk management Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT  department) Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in  RisktRAC Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC A system generated message is sent to people on the "curve list" indicating a  change in the RisktRAC curves has been made  If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the  VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis  and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new  curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in  RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in  ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.  The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:  Trader/risk management determines new book is needed New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global  counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and  counterparty systems Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is  sent to personnel on the "books list" and the book administrator in the risk  management department who requested the book  It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC  books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per  ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).  The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.   Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio  hierarchies.  The procedure now is:  Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy  changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk  Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to  submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management. Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested  change in structure Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management  that the change has been made.  If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123,  Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.  Thanks,  Shona 
beck-s	 We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not  being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in  approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :    The primary control issues are: ? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements ? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes ? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had  not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)  The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by  Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will  implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust  approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.   
beck-s	 Sally / Brent   FYI - no action required  This note and an earlier email ( forwarded separately ) highlights issues  around some transactions originated within Metals that arose due to  'misunderstanding' of limits - which was work in progress for Andrew  Cornfield ( Risk ), Lloyd Fleming ( RAC ) and Shane Dallman ( FX desk  -  reporting to Gary Hickerson ) working with the Metal Commercial MDs on the  subject of an exemption from Corp policy for IR and FX hedging.  It is pleasing that people in the control environment picked up the issues on  a timely basis but disappointing that a firm conclusion between the  Commerical groups on 'delegated' limits took longer than anticipated.

Metals traders will be advised that FX exposure may only be  generated as part of a hedge position to an underlying metal trade, and that  any FX exposure must be laid off via Roger  Murray-Evans (Metals FX trader)  and the Global Markets desk.  Averaging trades (FX and Bullion): Change method of booking trades so that  the averaging leg of all trades is booked as it arises (i.e. daily) and the  resulting FX exposure is captured daily and laid off with Global Markets as  part of the metals aggregation.  A number of other matters, which have been under discussion for some time,  were also agreed:-   Euro / Ali option:  Currently operates under a $30m FX limit and is managed  by Tim Jones.  It has been agreed that this limit will be reduced to $20m  (EMRAC to approve) and be a part of Gary Hickerson's limit.  As the options  expire, the limit will be progressively reduced.  The limit applies only to  this transaction and does not cover any other FX dealing by Enron Metals.   Any subsequent transactions of this nature will be covered under separately  proposed limits.  Overnight exposure: Enron Metals to apply for a small overnight limit to  cover trades booked after the end of day cut-off.   $2m total net open  position has been proposed, to be agreed with Gary Hickerson and form part of  his limits.  FX position management:  FX exposure generated through the day to be  aggregated and passed to the Global Markets desk.  regards   Lloyd Fleming RAC Market Risk Management Ph: + 44 20 7783 4532 Mobile: + 44 7760 17 87 42      
beck-s	 Sally, Brent and Gary,  In a meeting with Bryan, Jeff, Gary and Markus on Monday, November 20th, I  showed Bryan a copy of the monthly price verification procedures and the book  administrator's Price Verification Comparison Spreadsheet .  I also showed  Brent this information later in the day, as he had to leave before we all  left.  Therefore, I find Bryan's Operations' bullet  wrong and misleading.

The bullet is not reflective of  what is actually stated in the attached document. There is a month-end price verification process on the Credit book.   Trader pricing is compared to prime broker pricing.  Where the mark is  greater that 2 points, the difference is discussed with the trader.

The current mark of the 2 positions results in  approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :    The primary control issues are: ? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements ? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes ? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had  not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)  The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by  Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will  implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust  approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.          
beck-s	 The functional PRC for Accounting and Investor Relations (Directors and  above) will be held on Friday December 1 8:30 -  ???? in the Dezavala Room at  the Doubletreet Hotel.

beck-s	 Just a heads-up - a long-winded email, but please see highlighted paragraphs.  I find it hard to believe the scenario portrayed here, but stranger things  have happened - will keep you posted. ---------------------- Forwarded by Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT on 29/11/2000 08:44  ---------------------------   James New 28/11/2000 13:42 To: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Coralie Evans/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley  Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power  volatilities and correlations  As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power  traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option  portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that  the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in  their mark.  In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light.  Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as  this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a  matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you  may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the  deal ticket and not off any volatility curve.   The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue  for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at  the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot  use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise  options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any  way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the  few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new'  piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of  worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the  correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating)  the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the   underlying.   They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel  who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most  experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company).  This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of  Enron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the  volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that  different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value  the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns  over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it  does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc  calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike  price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the  forward price of the underlying itself.   We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in  Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start  to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.  Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or  gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no  there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure  given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what  the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have  Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega  or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to  work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like  to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem  (knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the  implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current  system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we  validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?  Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher  volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their  VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily  remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol  curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any  testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle).  The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the  impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.  I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing  the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been  covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having  to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and  are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies  of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have  not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in  gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that  it is not for a lack of trying.  Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived  inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.  James

beck-s	 I thank you all for volunteering to be members of the global standards task  force.  To keep you up to date on what is going on:  I am receiving sporadic reporting from most groups.  I have hired someone to be dedicated to this process (starting 1/1/01 - until  then, it is me and one person starting 12/11 who can dedicate some time) The key focus is report A01 and getting that consolidated - I am taking a  stab at it today. I am meeting with an Access programmer to develop a reporting tool to replace  the current Excel format By the end of the year my goal is to have daily reporting from all groups, to  have someone dedicated to review this daily reporting and raise issues, and  to have a dedicated IT person developing the Access database, to have weekly  consolidated reporting for A01, to determine the appropriate time frames for  reporting escalation and audience  What I would like the task force to concentrate on is to: Help review the individual reporting to determine if: It is adequate Where we should go from the current reporting guidelines Decide on appropriate audiences and levels for issue communication Decide on reporting formats Steer the process  I will send you copies of the reporting for the next couple of days so you  can get an understanding of what I am receiving and the problems people are  having.  Let me know your thoughts and concerns and I will consolidate them  and then we can discuss them as part of the task force.  Best regards  Shona

Effective Monday, November 20 the following  approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests  and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:  (A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two  approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting  Director approval of the general ledger coding.    (B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an  Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.  In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not  attached, then the payment will not be processed.  To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of  you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting  Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this  information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.  This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to  provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be  processed.           
beck-s	 I discussed with Ted and David, and they agree with Oliver's analysis below,  so Chris, let's go ahead and report on the $20MM loss against UK Gas in  today's notifications.  Then perhaps you can work with James to adjust DPR  reporting accordingly going forward.  Thank you, Cassandra.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Cassandra Schultz/NA/Enron on 12/06/2000  03:28 PM ---------------------------   Oliver Gaylard@ECT 12/06/2000 02:55 PM To: Cassandra Schultz/NA/Enron@ENRON cc: David Port/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Ted  Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: Loss Notification - "Structured Derivatives"    Cassandra  As discussed with Ted, David and yourself the loss should not be looked at on  its own as it is due to movements in two markets.  The UK power price curve shifted and the UK gas volatility curve shifted. The  P+L break out is as follows:  UK Power delta P+L      $38MM Spread options (Structured derivatives) gamma P+L  $(20)MM Spread options (Structured derivatives) vega P+L  $(23)MM UK Gas  vega P+L      $4MM  If prudency releases are stripped out I think if we allocate P+L to the  correct books we get the following total P+Ls exluding reserve releases:  UK Power       $18MM UK Gas        $(20)MM (Excludes reserve release of $17MM)  Therefore we only have a loss violation in UK gas. This is not trying to  avoid the $42MM loss notification, I am only trying to represent the loss  that reflects the true risk in the books of Europe.  Please hold off on the issue of a notification until it is decided that only  a loss notification is issued for gas.  Rgds  Oliver         From:  Cassandra Schultz @ ENRON                                                              06/12/2000 19:55	 	 	 	                            	  To: Michael Kass/EU/Enron@Enron, Chris Abel/HOU/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Oliver Gaylard/LON/ECT@ECT, David Port/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mike  Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enron   Subject: Loss Notification - "Structured Derivatives"  Per discussion with Ted Murphy, P/L related to the Eastern spread options  should be included in our Loss Notification monitoring in accordance with the  Risk Management Policy.  However, my understanding is that the positions and  VaR are captured in European Gas and UK Power, but the P/L is reported  separately in "Structured Derivatives".  This reporting is perhaps further  complicated by related prudencey being released in the line item European  Gas.    The 12/5 DPR reflects a ($43MM) loss in Structured Derivatives, and Oliver  indicated this represents the market moving against our Eastern spread option  position.  This is a Ken Lay level notification by any measurement standards,  regardless of whether you compare it to the $7,500 VAR limit for Gas, or the  $15,300 VaR limit for UK Power. Or even split it between them.  Chris, please include this loss in today's notification letters to Ken Lay  and Jeff Skilling for the 5th.  Per Oliver, the loss was due to power price  curve shift and gas volatility curve shift against the Eastern spread options.  Going forward, James, perhaps you could work with Oliver and the commercial  team to determine a reasonable methodology to support the allocation of P/L  and related DPR reporting  for these positions so we can continue to evaluate  in compliance with the policy.  Thank you, Cassandra.    
beck-s	 Dear UT Team Members:  We are in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been  extended.  In order to ensure our cultivation efforts I have assigned each of  you to one or more candidates to contact weekly, beginning this week.

beck-s	 Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk  management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our  deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.  Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):  7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC  8am meeting) 7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos 2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos  In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to  meet the following deadlines (Houston time):  before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure  information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG) 4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT 7:20 (all): export of preliminary information 7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos 11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for  Merchant Asset group) 12:00 (Houston only): export of final information   Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.   Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go  out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the  whole process.  Thank you,  Shona Wilson

beck-s	 Larry,  The ENA Accounting groups have had wires for our NYMEX and OTC margin calls  sent back due to improper signatures.  The timely flow of these monies is a  vital component to our trading organization.  I believe that these two items  fall under category "B" of the policy memo that was distributed (see email  below) and therefore should only require the signature of an Accounting  Director.  (B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an  Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.  We have a contractual obligation to our brokers and OTC counterparties to  provide margin according to the guidelines set forth in our agreements with  them.  These margin calls / returns of margin are monitored and amounts  signed off on by the RAC Credit Group (Bill Bradford's area).   Backup from  the Credit group should  be and is included with each wire.  I would appreciate your consideration of the above arguments to facilitate  the movement of these monies on a go-forward basis.  I will call you tomorrow  to discuss the possibility of having this change in effect for Monday Dec.  11.  Thank you.

I am president of my sorority at OU and because of my obligations to it, I have to be back in Norman by the 23 of July, making my last day of a summer job the 20th of July.  I did notice that the summer analyst program is 12 weeks long and I wouldn't be able to work  a full 12 weeks. The dates I am available are May 14-July 20.  I don't know if this presents a problem, but I wanted to check with you.  I would really like to take the offer if these circumstances were okay.  But I do understand otherwise. If you could let me know as soon as possible I would appreciate it!! Thanks so much.

beck-s	 Let's discuss - there were quite a few changes to be done first.    The first place to demo will be the Thursday lunch meeting to the Net Works  team when ready.     Thomas D Gros@ENRON 12/12/2000 01:13 PM To: Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Greg Whalley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Philippe A Bibi/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally  Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: CommodityLogic All-Module Demo  If you would like, the team will be prepared to show live demonstrations of  the latest versions of all four CommodityLogic modules next Thursday,  December 21st.  This would probably require about 2 hours.  The versions  displayed will be:  Financial Management Module 2.0 Financial Invoice Exchange 1.1 Confirm Central 1.0 Contract Exchange 1.0  Please let us know if you are interested in attending.  All the best,  Tom    
beck-s	 Rick Buy informed us this morning that the BOD approved, effective today, a  one week extension of the Temporary VaR allocation of $5MM to UK Power that  was made last week in the e-mail referenced below.  So the limit changes as  of 12/12/00 for Enron Europe:       through 12/22/00 12/23/00 - 12/31/00 1/1/01 1) UK Power VaR $20.3MM  $15.3MM  $13.95MM      UK Power NOP 68 Twh   68 Twh   59.5 Twh  If UK Power feels they need a VaR limit in excess of the schedule above, they  will need to meet with Ted Murphy and Rick Buy to discuss it further.   Currently, we have no Discretionary VaR available for allocation, but  re-allocation from another commodity group may be technically possible at  some point.  Although several other commodity groups are vying for the same VaR capital.  2) European Gas - NOP and Maturity/Gap Limits revert to permanent limits on  1/1/01 (as previously scheduled),  of 60 Bcf and 90 Bcf, respectively  3) Credit Trading - now includes the Debt Trading commodity group, and has  one combined limit structure:   NOP                  Maturity/Gap  VaR   $750,000 DV01/bp total        N/A   $5 MM  $  50,000 DV01/bp individual   4) Commodity Group Loss Notification requirements were changed as follows  (note: business units are encouraged to establish sub-limits):       Effective 12/12/00  Previous Daily Loss in any Commodity group or Portfolio:  ? Report to Business Unit Office of the Chairman 100% of VaR   not  specifically stated ? Report to Enron Corp. President   125% of VaR   50% of VaR ? Report to Enron Corp.

beck-s	 I have not personally talked to James about these issues in Enpower.  His  concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate.  IT is currently  working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use.  IT is also working on  correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly.  London trades  many more swaptions and asian options than the US; therefore, the impact of  not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them.   The majority of options in the U.S. are European monthly and daily exercises  and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals.  The  idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US, but other  more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal  specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have.  Once the technology is  in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt.   The system was  originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US  and as new markets and new ideas (such as the US becoming more and more of a  financial market) we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit.  Swaption  vols and asian options are two of these enhancements.   Also, it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower.  We have in stage an  option sensitivity matrix that, once implemented into production. I will be  sure that James knows about.  It probably will not solve all his problems,  but it will give him a starting place.  Stacey       	Enron North America Corp.

I find it hard to believe the scenario portrayed here, but stranger things  have happened - will keep you posted. ---------------------- Forwarded by Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT on 29/11/2000 08:44  ---------------------------   James New 28/11/2000 13:42 To: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Coralie Evans/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley  Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power  volatilities and correlations  As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power  traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option  portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that  the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in  their mark.  In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light.  Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as  this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a  matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you  may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the  deal ticket and not off any volatility curve.   The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue  for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at  the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot  use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise  options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any  way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the  few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new'  piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of  worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the  correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating)  the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the   underlying.   They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel  who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most  experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company).  This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of  Enron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the  volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that  different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value  the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns  over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it  does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc  calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike  price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the  forward price of the underlying itself.   We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in  Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start  to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.  Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or  gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no  there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure  given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what  the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have  Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega  or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to  work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like  to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem  (knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the  implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current  system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we  validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?  Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher  volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their  VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily  remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol  curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any  testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle).  The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the  impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.  I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing  the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been  covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having  to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and  are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies  of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have  not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in  gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that  it is not for a lack of trying.  Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived  inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.  James      
beck-s	 Dear Sally,  We have been preparing this information daily.  Until the end of the year,  either Nancy or I will send it to you.  The full blown exception reporting  will start the first week of January, including elevation of issues (so you  won't get it every day anymore) when Christy starts.  I also have a  contractor currently developing an Access database to capture all exception  reporting info.  For the past few days, I have been hoping to spend time following up on the  issues, not only in the deal capture arena, but in all reporting. Once the  markets calm down, I'll be able to do so.

beck-s	 I'd like to get together as a group and discuss both Commodity Logic & DCAF  projects and see if we can put together a joint high level vision for  supporting the trade clearing functions.  Here are the items I'd like to  initially discuss:  Commodity Logic Deliverables, timing and perhaps a demo or screen shots to  show where we currently are in our development. Current DCAF requests and current areas of pain communicated from the user  side. Legal & Credit concerns or issues known at this time.  Once we have put together a strawman or high level plan then let's follow up  with the larger user community and see if this address the highest priority  concerns that were brought up at the Deal Clearing JAD session.    Cheryl:  Please set up an hour and a half meeting with the people addressed  under cc: above to discuss the subject listed above.  I'd like to meet ASAP  and would be willing to buy lunch if that aids us in getting this scheduled  sooner than later. 
beck-s	 Last week y'all asked us to follow up with several key individuals within the  ENA group to see how it's going with SAP.  We were not to give any "hints";  just ask some open-ended (but probing) questions.  I'm attaching all the  responses (Georgeann directed us to Greg W ).  I don't see anything alarming  or red-hot -- I just hope they were being totally candid and honest with  us!!  Overall I would categorize them as normal support issues around the  areas of needing some spot "1-on-1" training for users, more experience in  overall information retrieval, editing of some reports, our security process  and the difficulty of getting information from various and sundry databases  (since SAP is interfaced) to get the full picture.  We have passed all these items on to the appropriate Solution Mgr, so that  they can specifically address them.  As I think I mentioned several months ago we had complaints about  nonresponsiveness (calls not being returned, being passed around alot, etc).   Hopefully we've turned the corner there.  Please let me know if there are other areas you'd like us to address (as we  discussed), otherwise we will continue to try to keep our finger on the  pulse.  And please let me know who our contact person from ENA should be.

EES - $2MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00  ------------------------>  EXTENDED THROUGH 1/5/01  Aggregate VaR Limit of $140MM - $40MM expiring on 12/22/00 ---------->  EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 - reduced to permanent Aggregate VaR Limit of $100MM  NA Gas - $35MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ------------------>  EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)  UK Power - $5MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ---------------->  EXPIRES AFTER 12/22/00 (with reduction in Aggregate VaR Limit to $100MM)  NA Gas - $15MM Discretionary VaR expiring on 12/22/00 ----------------->  EXTEND $10MM THROUGH 1/5/01         -----------------> REALLOCATE $5MM to UK Power THROUGH 1/5/01.    Therefore, the following VaR limits are/will be in place:      now - 12/22/00  12/23/00 - 1/5/01 1/6/01 EES    $7MM   $7MM  $5MM  NA Gas    $110MM  $70MM  $60MM  UK Power   $20.3MM  $20.3MM $15.3MM  Aggregate VaR Limit  $140MM  $100MM $83MM    Vlady/Frank - Ted told Lavorato the NA Gas information on Friday.  Vlady/Minal - nothing to my knowledge has been communicated to EES yet.  You  can check with Ted to see if he did already.  Oliver, please communicate the anticipated limit changes for UK Power to the  commercial and risk management/energy ops people who need to know.  If an  extension is needed in the Discretionary VaR, at this point an analysis and  presentation will be required to justify the extension to get Rick Buy and  Ted Murphy to approve.  Feel free to call me with any questions.  I'm out on vacation this week, but  can be reached at home or on my cell phone.  Happy Holidays, Cassandra. home  936 321 2185 cell 713 858 2618

beck-s	 The following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the  DPR over the next two weeks.  I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and  Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for  trading that day.  The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December  22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first Enron official  business day to do so (i.e. Wednesday, December 27th).  That will work as  long as trading results for Friday, December 22nd are not dramatic.  Please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on Friday, December  22nd for Chris Abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for  December 22nd.  If there are dramatic results, Chris may produce a  preliminary and rough DPR on Tuesday, December 26th with the information that  you provide.  For locations that will not calc and officialize books on  Friday, December 22nd, you will still need to contact Chris to give him your  best estimate of trading results.  Thanks for your continuing help in providing timely and accurate information  for the worldwide trading organization.  I hope that all of you enjoy your  holidays.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Sally Beck/HOU/ECT on 12/19/2000 11:31 AM  ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp.

beck-s	 Attached is a draft of the Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement which will  be used to allow Brokers to transact on behalf of their customers.  Please  review the document and give me any comments.  Please pay particuliar  attention to Section 3 Transactions.    Also please note that it will be imperative that broker confirmations are  done each day on Broker Client Transactions to limit the exposure associated  with online transaction broker breakage costs.  The confirmations group will  be responsible for confirming each day and notifying credit immediately of  any discrepancies between Enron and the Broker.   Notification by the  confirmations group will be the only means by which credit will be informed  to shut down broker activity in the case of a transaction that has not been  confirmed and/or verified by the broker.  Thank you 
beck-s	 Jeff,  I am forwarding information about derivatives I & II to you for your  consideration.   The Paradigm Group would conduct the training in house  around the middle of the month for your group's convenience.   We have had  prior experience with their progam and recommend them.    I don't know if the  cost is within your budget but, I understand the importance of uniformly  training your group in derivatives. Let me know your thoughts, hgm ---------------------- Forwarded by Hector McLoughlin/Corp/Enron on  12/21/2000 11:49 AM ---------------------------   Tom Wilbeck 12/21/2000 11:31 AM To: Hector McLoughlin/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject: D1 and D2  As per your client's request, here is the information I was able to come up  with concerning derivatives training:  While I recognise the need for a time-efficient approach to derivatives  training, the benefit of this class will be diminished with any compression  or omission of subject matter.  It is recommended that the two-day format  remain the same.  All "Ernie" derivatives classes are full for the next three months; however,  the vendor can provide a "by invitation only" D1 class in mid January.  As  many as 50+/- employees can attend this class during the week of January  16th.  The proposed schedule is as follows:  1/16/00   1/17/00   1/18/00   1/19/00 D1 (day one)  D1 (day two)  D1 (day one)  D1 (day two) first 25 people  first 25 people  second 25  second 25 $6000   $6000   $6000   $6000  The vendor is quite booked for the 1st quarter.  They are not able to offer  D2 until mid March or April if the Mid month schedule is to be followed.  One  D2 class could be offered on 2/1/00 and 2/2/00 should this be an acceptable  option.  Another D2 class may be available on 2/8/00 and 2/9/00, but this has  not been confirmed by the vendor as of yet.    The daily rate is $6000 for 25 students.  Classes are not recommended to  exceed 25 people.  We need to get back to the vendor quickly to secure these  dates if we'd like to do this.    If you need additional information, please let me know.  Tom Wilbeck 57536

beck-s	 Dear Sally and Bob,   My wife will be having brain surgery soon and I will not be readily available  for a few dates this month.     I will be out of the office on:  Tuesday, January 2nd Monday, January 8th Thursday, January 11th  I will continue to check my voice mails and e-mails but your primary HR  contact for those dates will be Frank deJesus at ext. 53662.     I will also  be in contact with Frank and checking my cell-phone voice mails  periodically.  That number is 713-854-0839.     I have coordinated with Frank, Janet, and AnneMarie the issues that may arise  and what needs to be taken care of.   I am confident that your group's needs  will be met during this busy time.

I will also leave Rick a voice mail...  ay       	 	 	From:  Sally Beck @ ECT                           12/29/2000 06:02 PM 	  To: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Andrea Yowman/Corp/Enron@ENRON   Subject: Internal Feedback for PRC  I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent  Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.  Those appeared to be the only names that  you included for which you wanted my input.  Somehow, from Andrea's voice  mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I  thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP.   Those weren't  on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to know  that I have responded to the three that were there.  If there was intent for  me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system. (Believe  me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP  as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).  --Sally

beck-s	 Sally  Steve and I did some 'thinking' during the downtime between Christmas and New  Year and we were questioning whether there was a definitive business planning  document for CL - indeed if there was one, has it now been changed to reflect  the new priorities consistent with your involvement and leadership ?  Such documentation could assist us in relaunching our Envision program which  ( as a result of necessity ) has become over the last few months a more  generic change management control process for Enron Europe  Will be in touch  Mike 
beck-s	 I am planning to take a three week vacation in March of this year.  This is a  special trip with my older sister who underwent treatment for breast cancer  last year.  I have confirmed that all of my direct reports will be here  during my absence.  Also, I will have my pager and a laptop with me during  this time.  I am planning to book my trip in the next day or two.  Can you  let me know if you have any problems or concerns with the length of my  planned holiday?  I have already spoken to Jon McKay, and he has no problem  with my plans. Thanks Peggy

beck-s	 Sally -   We didn't really cover the role you intended to play with EES and EBS as far  as Doorstep is concerned when we met with Causey/Buy.  (Or I just can't  remember.) May we include EES and EBS in the scope of our one Doorstep  project, and continue to work with Shona, also coordinating with Wanda and  Barry when EES and EBS are involved?  Things like the event below might make  us re-consider our need to visit "origination" offices.  I don't think this  office was on any of our lists.

EES exposure is ~$6 million. This transaction has not been approved  by the Credit group and it seems that they have little clue about Enron's  processes and procedures. I believe Clinton Gas is located in Dublin, Ohio  and suggest that it be included on the Door Step list.  Vlady. 
beck-s	 Here's a summary of our conversation so you have points to follow up with.  General Status of the Database model:   FIX not represented - need to incorporate into common design and standardize  - might cause some FIX rework.  Referential Integrity not entirely enforced  - potential for bad data to  develop.   Snapshots from Global databases are currently daily - this can be easily  changed to be more frequent, but need to consider implementation as  decision   on direction of Global as a part of Commodity Logic is made.   Rate information not developed - need integration with Rate Server or MKM,  preferably MKM. Need to define how MKM will be used-whether just for index   names or to obtain actual settlement prices or curves as well.  Application development is not currently occurring on a single version of  the database.  Therefore, some issues could arise as each development team    migrates to the standard. This needs to happen relatively quickly.  Specific Issues:  GFD_PIPE_METERS_SNP -  Probably need to add FAC_TYPE (WH, ITE, etc) for  possible use as validation in KX functionality  GAS_DEAL_LOCATION_DTL -  This table refers to facility number rather than  pipe and meter.  Facility number is an Enronism that no other company  will      recognize.    Pipe and Meter General -   Should try to avoid using Pipe_Cd as key.  This  value needs to be updateable as pipelines are bought and sold.     -   Data for Facilities is heavily dependent upon Enron Global Facilities  Database in current design and functionality-this      needs revisiting as  the decision surrounding Global is made   CP_ADDR_VW  - This table references only internal_cp_id and contact_type_cd  in conjunction with address_id.  Addresses are specific to       internal_cp_id, product_cd, deal_nature_cd, contact_type_cd, and region_cd.   Need to add deal nature, product, and      region to ensure correct address  usage since many companies align their business along these determinants  and      addresses may vary  COUNTERPARTY - There is a mixture of the usage of Global Counterparty.  Some  areas indicate a certain amount of independence from      Enron's Global  Counterparty system, by having a table to capture Commodity Logic information  on a counterparty such      as phone numbers, credit ratings, etc. This would  position CL to become independent at a later date.  Yet, Commodity      Logic  functions as a subset of Enron Networks and GCP must make entries to indicate  the usage of a customer by Enron      Networks to obtain an SAP id and  support payment processing through to SAP.  So, CL could not become  independent      without further functionality or process changes.  So why  not put the added data requirements within GCP to start with?   If       Global moves to Commodity Logic, then this design needs to be revisited for  sure.  There should probably be some      standardization between  dependence/independence whether or not CL separates from Enron.   Common Data  - Status is not included in the views being utilized by the  applications.  I hope the views have been filtered for active       status  only.  Show was going to check on this.     - Concept of mapping others' codes to ours for processing, is not  supported anywhere in these tables.  Perhaps       that has been handled in  an isolated manner in the FIX design? This will have to be there for internal  release as well as      external release.  This is critical to the hub  concept.  I look forward to sitting in on your meetings surrounding these issues.  Let  me know if you have further questions.

More information about  their products can be found at http://www.cavio.com/.  They would like to  visit Enron and discuss the potential of partnering with us.  Essentially  they would charge our customers a fee for the process of clearing or settling  their transactions and share a portion of the revenue with Enron.  The  benefit to our customers is a reduced cost for letters of credit.    Bottom line is that they would like to meet with us and see if their is any  interest in trying to put something together.  Please let me know if you are  interested in being a part of the meeting and I will coordinate setting it  up.

It appears the last points have been ironed out and that CheMatch will be  going forward with the Cavio Solution.  Our CEO and VP of Sales will be  attending a meeting with CheMatch in Houston in mid to late January.  As  well, interest has been shown from the Natural Gas Exchange (www.ngx.com) and  Automated Power Exchange (www.apx.com).  From our discussions, it has become  apparent that these two sites currently deal with Enron at some level and  both agree that the Cavio Solution could effect a positive change in the lag  time currently seen for billing cycles (up to 55 days) as well as providing  other benefits.  I feel that with Enron and CheMatch setting a new standard  with Cavio, many of your current clients will be eager to join, and your  competition will be left behind. Based on the fact that you had expressed interest in Cavio and Beta testing  the Cavio Solution for trades currently happening between Cheats and Enron,   I think that it may be an ideal time to plan a meeting with your team in  conjunction with our meeting with CheMatch.   Please advise as soon as possible.  Thanks.

Would you please get the necessary information to Susan Wimberly  so that we can get this straightened out in PEP and in the GCS as soon as  possible?  Thanks, hgm  Susan,  As you can see the Dec. 1 PRC date loaded after the Dec. 8th PRC and changed  the intended final rankings for the 3 Directors in the attachment below.    Please make the appropriate changes to be reflected in PEP.

beck-s	 Once the Arcos plant in Spain is financially closed (expected in Q2 of this  year) Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston to work exclusively on  co-managing Enron's LNG markets.   We are very appreciative of Eric's efforts  in Europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very  closely with his LNG team in the coming years.  From this point forward Eric  will focus his remaining time in Europe exclusively on financially closing  Arcos.  We are therefore making the following changes immediately.   The origination  responsibility for Italy will be moved under  Eric Shaw.  Ricardo Bortolloti  will continue in the role as Italian Country Manager and will report to Eric  Shaw.   Mariano Gentilini will become our Country Manager for Spain and  Portugal and will report directly to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.  The Arcos Power Project is likely to create a large gas to power spread  position and so we have asked Paul Mead to assume the added responsibility  for our natural gas risk positions in Spain.  This position is much more  likely to be supplied and influenced by LNG rather than Continental Gas  markets and Paul will  work quite closely with both Enron Global Markets and  the Continental Gas team.  Ross Sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in Holland will also  head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power  transmission opportunities across Europe.   Among the prospects his team will  pursue include projects  from Norway to the UK,  Sweden to the Continent,   and bidding on existing French interconnector capacity.   He will report  to  Eric Shaw for the Holland markets and to Richard Lewis for the Transmission  responsibilities.  Finally the Continental Gas team is interacting far more with our UK gas team  than our power teams on the Continent.  Therefore David Galagher who manages  our Continental Gas team  will now report directly to Richard Lewis.  We have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that  these  changes will create the right links to optimize our performance.  Please help  make these changes as smooth as possible.

beck-s	 Frank and I are staying at the Sheraton Belgravia which is about a 5 minute  walk to our office  -- it is small and quiet but nice rooms.  It is not on a  major street like Picadilly or Park Lane, but we like it.  The rate is about  o190 a night  We had to move out of our flat on Monday, so are staying there until we  leave.  Right now we are scheduled to fly out on Sat the 20th.  Also --- just a few notes on next week  I am free Monday night if you would like to have dinner.  I know Frank and  Maureen will be in Spain that night, they are back on Tuesday    Also my going away party that Fernley is throwing is on Wed night -- so  hopefully most people will drop by there.  It is just a pub thing near the  office, but hopefully you can make it!  I am sure there will be dinner or  something afterwards.

conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming  months.  Over the next few days, I will be forwarding more details about the  transition process.  These details will outline the employment opportunities  and transfer process to AEP.   AEP is eager to complete these arrangements,  as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it.  During the transition period, it is important that we keep the pipe line  operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy  needs of our customers.  Regards, Brian       
beck-s	 Sally, We have been able to work with Legal and Tax  to impact the way our trading  has been set up in London  and Tokyo to increase our control of the business  and simplify the requirements for support.  In London, for Equity Trading we will be trading as ECT Investments Inc. (the  same entity as in Houston).  We will have mirror books in the UK as in  Houston (e.g. Energy and Energy - London).  We have put a service agreement  in place setting up a Enron Investment Services Ltd. (uk entity) who will  trade on our behalf as an agent.  This keeps ENA from establishing a presence  for Equity Trading in the UK Tax authority.  We pay the UK entity, our  agent,  a service fee and deduct the service fee on ECT Investment's taxes as  an expense.  Controls are increased because all the books and reporting  remains consolidated into one entity.   In Tokyo, we have started a Rate & Currency Trading Desk.  We initially were  told by tax that we would have to trade in the name of Enron Japan.  This  would require separate bank accounts, separate counterparty agreements and  much more coordination to control.  We and the trader worked with Tax so they  understood the difficulties that this would present.  Also, Japan did not  want to assurme the funding requirements for this activity with their office  and wanted it segregated.  This further understanding caused Tax to push  further to gather other advise from outside counsel operating in the Tokyo  market.   We are and will be able to trade as ENA.  Therefore, the same bank accounts  and ISDAs may be utilized.  All activity, positions and VAR continues to be  netted for ENA.  Additionally our counterparties can trade with a trusted,  established entity, ENA, and we get to net, limiting exposure.  These are two cases where we can impact the structure of the business to  increase controls and our level of support.  In both cases, joint and  successful cooperation occurred between trading, tax, legal and operations.  Sheila

beck-s	 Dear Sally:  Congratulations on your new role! All the best with it!!!  Best Regards, Joseph Koothrappally 
beck-s	 Sally,  Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  It is well deserved  and most appropriate.  In addition,  it always warms my heart when I see a  woman promoted to the highest rank in our company.    Best regards, Jean 
beck-s	 Sally, Congratulations!!  Very much deserved! I hope everything else is going well.  Let's try to do lunch soon. Kristin 
beck-s	 fyi - further thoughts to consider for our prep meeting on the 26th.   Sally - while you are in London, do you want to share information with Mike  regarding the ASE so he can block his schedule and be planning his trip?   Might be good to see if he has one or two Managers he would also like to  attend.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT on 01/18/2001  09:17 AM ---------------------------   Lisa Petruszka@ENRON 01/17/2001 03:08 PM To: Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Notes on ASE Studio  Hello Mary-   Here is a rough strating point of the ASE Studio planning document.  I have  included the objectives we discussed initially - we will continue to refine  them as we move forward.    Also, I inserted the notes I made during the offsite on Friday.  My notes  were primarily focused on information that the participants were wanting or  that I thought might be useful.  Also, I jotted down quite a few questions  that came up during the session.  Some of them were addressed on Friday and  others were not.  We do not necessarily need to address all of these at the  ASE - and I would suspect there are others that should be addressed but are  not listed here.  I'm sending this information in advance for your review and  thought.  If you have any questions or would like to discuss, please let me know. Lisa P 5-6352  
beck-s	 Sally,  Have you had a chance to look at UT presentation for Monday?  I will need to  email final copy to Lexi by Monday morning (her flight is 2:00 PM) and she  would like a cd for backup.  I can handle that.  She has supplied me with new  dates for last page.  If you get a chance to review - just fax pages to me at  713-345-8100.  If not, I can work on it monday morning.  Again, I am so happy for you.  It's such a BIG deal to be promoted to MD.   Please share any thoughts you might have with me on how this affects my role  as your assistant and what I can do to better assist you.  You know, this job  that I have now with you is the job I have waited for all my life.  It is  challenging, fast-paced, and has a lot of potential for growth.  You make me  feel like I the work I am doing is important and valuable.   I have an  enormous amount of respect for you as a person and of the work that you do  and know that I am extremely lucky to have this job.    Patti 
beck-s	 Dear Phil, Joe, & Marcelo,  I wanted to drop you a line on behalf of your doorstep visitors to let you  know we appreciate the time, effort, and cooperation the NY, St Louis, and  Chicago staff gave us with our reviews.  The significant changes in the  control environment have not gone unnoticed and I am impressed with the  changes that have been made.  Additionally, we have all noted the willingness  of the employees to adapt to these changes and their excitement to be part of  Enron.  To let you know, most of the issues we identified during our work  this summer have been cleared.  I understand that  you have been through the draft report for our visit last  week to NY (which covered concentrates, copper scrap, primary aluminium &  secondary aluminium).  Please let Veronica or I know if you have any changes.  Best regards  Shona 713 853 9123

beck-s	 Steve  We may have been overtaken by events - I spoke to Sally today on this, GCP  and operational cost model  Apologies for the cancelled meeting - I wanted Steve to be there and he is  sick - but I will call after Sally has had a chance to brief you on today's  conversations  regards - and thanks for the message  Mike       	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	From:  Steve Venturatos                           18/01/2001 17:14 	  To: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT cc: James Scribner/Corp/Enron@Enron   Subject: Global Rates  I thought I would share with you my ideas in regard to my upcoming trip to  London.  I would like to meet with you and James New for about an hour when I first  arrive to get a feel of your businesses and to give both of you an update on  the new and improved Global Rates Group.   I would also appreciate it if I  could unobtrusively sit with several of your risk groups in order to among  other things, get an idea of the types of commodities London trades and their  respective Exchanges and to become familiar with the current process that  London uses to capture commodity rates.    After a couple of days, I am confident that I could have an idea of how  Global Rates could be of the most benefit to London.  This trip would of course be charged to the Global Rates CC and not allocated  back to London, since it is a "discovery"  trip, which we have budgeted for  in our 2001 budget.  I wouldn't want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business,  therefore would you please let me know when you and James would be in London  during the next couple of  weeks and I will schedule my trip accordingly.  Thanks again for your assistance, it is unfortunate that our teleconference  scheduled for today got cancelled.  
beck-s	 Sally:  Summer Analysts will benefit from our recent compensation changes.  Their  monthly salary this summer will be $3333.00  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you, and I look forward to seeing you in Austin Monday.  lexi 3-4585 cell: 281/793-1097

beck-s	 What are your thoughts on Team Leadership?  Several of the managers in the  group were using them last year for coaching and I have received very  positive feedback.   I would like for them to be able to continue with the  counseling, but wanted to see what you thought.  Thanks! Sheri 
beck-s	 Tom Wilbeck@ENRON 01/19/2001 03:23 PM To: Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Trading Track Information  As you know, we are working on an on-boarding process to get the trading  track participants up to speed as quickly as possible in each of their  respective rotations.  One of the methods of doing this is to have each  rotational supervisor (you're one of them) put a few points together to  present to each participant on the first day of their rotation with you (or  someone in your group).    For example: What does you group do as a whole?  The Risk Management Group is responsible  for providing information to the trading floor.  That information consists of  positions,  p&l,  and other general information which may be needed by the  floor throughout the day.  The information must be 100% accurate 100% of the  time as the gas floor is taking positions based on the information they are  given.  In addition,  all reports go to SR.  Management such as John Lavorato  and Dave Delaney.  The participants need to know several logistics type things such as:  where to sit  User tips on the use of related business hardware (i.e. phone system,  intercom, etc.)  How long/when or if to take lunch: use your discretion.  Expected working hours: Expect to be in the office no later than 8:00 and  preferably by 7:30  It is also important to cover the expected learning criteria with the  participants on their first day:  able to work under pressure - You will be asked to provide reports and  answers to questions on the floor quickly.  You will be expected to know and  understand the information that you are giving.  ability to handle multiple priorities - There will be times when you are  faced with several tasks at once.  You will be expected to make quick  decisions and understand which is the most important.  meets deadlines - Everyday in Risk you have to meet a deadline.  The traders  must have positions and p&l on their desks when they walk in in the morning.  Excellent written communication - Your written communication will be in the  numbers that you provide to the floor.  Excellent oral communication - Again,  the traders will expect answers and  expect them quickly.  You will need to articulate those in a fashion that is  understandable.  Effective interpersonal skills -  see above.  Attention to detail - This is one of the most important considerations of  the job.  Again,  all information must be 100% accurate,  errors are not  acceptable.  Team player -  You will be expected to work across all groups upstream and  downstream to provide accurate information and solve related problems.  Excellent organisational skills - speed and accuracy are a hallmark of the  job,  therefore you will need to be organized at all times.  Is a motivated worker -  self explainatory  Excellent analytical skills - same  Maintains relationships with traders -  The trader will be relying on the  information that you provide him.  Therefore it is important that he trusts  what you are giving to him and that you are always asking if they need more  or better information.  Effective time management -  self explainatory  Competent in Excel -  Alot of the work we do is in excel.  It is important  that you be able to navigate excel, as well as create efficiencies to make  the job less prone to errors and to run more smoothly.  Competent with ERMS - ERMS is the system that is used to maintain positions  and p&l.  All deals flow through this system and all values related to deals  come from this system.  Competent with Risktrac - Risktrac is the system that tracks counterparty  risk and Value at Risk.  I expect you to understand what each means,  what  the limits are,  and how you can reduce and add to value at risk.  Demonstrates knowledge of trading concepts - Work with the traders to  understand why they are putting on the positions that they have.  Try to  understand proper hedging strategies etc.  Each participant who comes to your area needs to know your interpretation of  each of these competencies so they can make sure to meet your expectations  while in your area.  Also, the participants need to fully understand exactly what they'll be doing  in your area.  Let 'em know with as much detail as possible.  Finally, Do you consider any information a pre-requisite for participation in  your area ?(i.e. Advanced Excel skills...etc) I'd like to know so we can push the participants to get the needed training  before coming to your group.  Advanced Excel skills,  preferably a level of  understanding of positions and value at risk.  Please compile this information and forward it to me so I can put it into  some on-boarding material for all of the candidates by their first day of  rotations.  The first candidates will begin on February 1, 2001.    Thank you very much for you time and consideration.  Tom Wilbeck X57536

beck-s	 I am asking Tammie to compile a Weekly Report (for delivery 8am Monday  mornings) which is formatted as below.  Please make sure starting next week  the information if received in adequate time.  Deals Signed LOI Signed NDAs signed Earnings Report (from Kerry) Individual Group general update (to include deals working plus other info)  Thanks  Louise 
beck-s	 Fran,  List below are some questions that HPL personnel are asking:  What will happen if I tell AEP I do not want an offer?  We have heard from pretty reliable sources that AEP only wants 60 to 75  employees.  Do we know anything about this??  Can I post, even though I have only been in my current job less than one year?  What happens to my balance in the current pension plan (cash part)?  What happens to my options left to vest?  Will my time at Enron bridge to AEP for vacation and retirement?  Will Enron review all of the offers to make sure they are equivalent?  Who will decide if it is an equivalent offer?  If it is not an equivalent offer, how long before 1) I am severed from Enron,  2) how long will I be in the redeployment pool? 3). What will the severence package look like?   4) When will  severence be paid?  Let me know.  I'll keep gathering the questions.  thanks  bob 
beck-s	 First of all congratulations on your promotion, it is well deserved.  You are  really in some rarefied air, since there seem to be very few Managing  Directors.  I also would like to compliment you on putting together one of the best  2  1/2  hour seminars / workshops that I have ever attended ( I know that is  saying a mouthful).  The Operational Risk Meeting / Workshop was not only  informative, but the constantly changing formats kept everyone's attention.    I believe the meeting also caused a renewed enthusiasm among your supervisory  personnel.  This is not only my observation, but the feeling of all of the  people that I have talked to over the past few weeks.   Once again, congrats.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
beck-s	 Sally,  Thought this was good....   Cindy  Hey, here is another wonderful group of facts about women.  I don't normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance.  Even if your a skeptic read to the bottom.    Did you know that it's Beautiful Women Month? Well, it is and that means you.   There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels . . .and only eight who do. Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14. If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions. The average woman weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9-14. One out of every four college aged women has an eating disorder. The models in the magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect!  A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and shameful.  Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman. Today they  weigh 23% less.  *****  Beauty of a Woman -  The beauty of a woman Is not in the clothes she wears, The figure she carries Or the way she combs her hair.  The beauty of a woman Must be seen from her eyes, Because that is the doorway to her heart, The place where love resides.  The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole, But true beauty in a woman Is reflected in her soul.  It is the caring that she lovingly gives The passion that she shows, The beauty of a woman With passing years - only grows.  *****  An English professor wrote the words, "Woman without her man is nothing," on the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly.  The men wrote: "Woman, without her man, is nothing."   The women wrote: "Woman! Without her, man is nothing." *****  The Images of Mother - 4 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mommy can do anything! 8 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mom knows a lot!  A whole lot! 12 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mother doesn't really know quite everything. 14 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either. 16 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 18 YEARS OF AGE  ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 25 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it. 35 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion. 45 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about it? 65 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.  Please send this to five phenomenal women today in celebration of Women's History Month.  If you do, something good will happen...  You will Boost another woman's self-esteem. 
beck-s	 Hi Sally  Congratulations on your promotion!  I was hoping to congratulate you in person while you were in London - but you  seemed really busy.  Every time you walked through our area I was on the  phone!  Hope to catch up with you next week when I visit Houston.  Best wishes   Amita 
beck-s	 Very good cross over of ideas - I will push Andy to see the communication  expand - there must be substantive correlation between these physical  businesses at the operational level !!

I had you on my "To Do" list today to  follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and  will follow-up as needed.  Just to recap EIM's current inititives.  PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan  for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical  business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a "Blueprint" of EIM major  processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics,  Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes.  The  initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the  "Blueprint", a gap analysis of Enron systems to business needs and  recommended systems.  A complete "roadmap" should be laid out with a  0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline.  The plan  addresses tactical also.    Our overall objective:  Build an infrastructure (people, processes and  systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM.  The  current industries are Forest Products and Steel.  However, additional  industries may be added.  The targeted infrastructure would require little  change to support new industries.    The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01.  We'd be happy to visit with  you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information.  Let  me know how to proceed.    Thanks again for your time.  Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers'  Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week.  Stay in touch.  Brenda   To: Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Wallace/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Metals  Brenda  As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality  between Enron Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals.  In particular I promised info on a few areas:  Project Q assessment  A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to Enron Metals  (being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues  which formed part of the decision to not develop this for Enron metals were: Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less  complex than oil & coal. Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage  is not as prevelant Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge  2.    Inventory Controls  Again the reports produced here have been very specific to Enron Metals. Paul  Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on  developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul  directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in  general.  3.    Funding of inventory  We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to  Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are  the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured  financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either  David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro  to the issues faced.  4.    Curve Management Process  The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME  curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and  location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by  brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with  5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6  for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made  manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port  groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points  i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a  market quote.  5.    Re recruitment of paper traders  I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David  Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced  paper.  I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London.  I'd appreciate same for EIM.  Regards Andy            
beck-s	 Thanks to each of you for your help Monday night.  The Information Session  was a success!  We had over 100 interested students attend, and I believe  that each one was able to ask questions and speak to an Enron  representative.    The dinner afterwards was also quite a success.  We were able to spend time  with 19 of our full-time candidates...congratulating those who have accepted,  and convincing those who have not yet signed.  It, too, was quite successful  as I had 2 additional acceptances the following morning from Geiv Dubash and  Daniel Jenkins.  Thanks again!  lexi 
beck-s	 Mike,    Thanks for your message.  You are on point as to my intent.  From the  discussion I had with Andy last week, there seems to be several similarities  between the Metals business and industrial markets.  I believe the blueprint  that is forthcoming will provide more insight that will be helpful to you  all.  We would love to share this with you, and also discuss your system  direction.  There may be some opportunities for us to work together on the  development.  I would like to have a discussion to talk about next steps, and  believe Andy is planning to initiate this after he returns from holiday.  Let  me know if you have some other ideas.  I'm sorry that we didn't have a chance to get together last week while I was  in London.  My trip was very short, and I kept missing you when I went to  your desk.  I'll plan some time with you when I'm there next time.

beck-s	 Yesterday I was informed that there was a concern about the financial  stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago  area, Premier Reload Inc.  I met with Romney Ruder, Lumber trader, Roy  Lipsett, Logistics, and Mike Moscoso, Lumber business controller, this  morning to gather information and develop a plan.  This is summarized below.  General Information:  Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months, located in  Franklin Park within Chicago.  We deliver to the facility via railcar, and  ship out via truck.  We currently have about 3.8 million board feet, valued  at about $1 million, in the facility.  During the holidays, we began  experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely.  We have  been pressing for information, and are hearing rumors that have raised  significant concerns.  Although Enron has not received written notification,  we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be  taking in any more products.  Additionally, we have heard that the owner,  Jeff Leske, is closing the facility, and will be going to work for another  reload facility in Chicago, Reserve Marine Terminal (RMT).  We have been in  negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement, and much of the  information we have obtained is through our contact there.  In fact, we have  diverted recent shipments to RMT.  There is a rumor that Premier and /or  Leske may declare bankruptcy.  There is a rumor that Premier has been  incurring "switching" fees with the railroad (IHB) and has not been paying  them.  There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes and  there are problems with the IRS.  All in all, there are many rumors but very  few known facts.  Plan:  Met with Legal today to get advice.  They recommended moving the product  ASAP, but until moved, we needed to confirm the product was marked as "Enron"  product, and that it is stored separately from other product.  They are  drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier.  It will be  ready tomorrow. Met with Credit.  They are not a included in the reload selection process, so  the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed.  A D&B was  pulled today, and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on 6/22/00 for  $86,128.  There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal  amount, filed 1/13/00.  The company is owned 100% by Leske, and was started  in 1995.  Very little other information is available, and D&B did not assign  a PAYDEX score. Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to:  gather  financial information, intentions of the owner and the associated timeline,  substantiate the inventory, and get the contract signed that Legal is  drafting.  On Friday morning, Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT,  discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations. Depending on the information gathered tomorrow, we will determine next  steps.  If we start moving the product to RMT, the estimated timeline is  about 13 to 14 days, moving 10 trucks per day (total truckloads = 135).   Estimated cost for the movement is about is $25,000.  Another $25,000 would  be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we can't get them to wave them.  About  half of the product has already been sold, and will be delivered over the  next 5 weeks.  Romney is working with customers to determine if they can take  the product earlier.  I will keep you informed as to the next events.  However, we need to take  immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing  facilities.  I have initiated weekly cross-functional staff meetings (Tax,  Legal, Credit, IT, Logistics, Fundemental Analysis, Accounting, etc.), and  our first meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.  I will have this on the agenda,  and will lead the effort to develop the process.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Brenda x35778

beck-s	 Gary and Georgeanne let me know that all but 487 shares of EOG are hedged  (without the EOG leg, the Cerberus total return swap is really only a loan,  and its VaR is about $500 thousand).  I have recalculated, and the total  return swaps VaR fell to $34 million in December and $18 million in  November.  December VaR is still up substantially from November, and the  primary reason now is that since natural gas prices are up so much, the value  of the Bammel Looper and Mid Texas total return swaps has increased.  The  more money we make, the more we can potentially lose.  Regards,   Eugenio

To complete=  a=20 plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an=20 integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at= =20 their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20  I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig= n=20 session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t= h=20 in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called = a=20 DesignShop=01v.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos= ed of=20 various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups.

You were= =20 selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th= e=20 DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as= =20 little distraction or interruption as possible.

beck-s	 A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our  procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate  action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we  have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard  was going on there.   We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there  isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate  action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better.  More to come.  Rick 
beck-s	 Ted tells me you guys have already taken action on this which greatly  relieves me. I did not want this procrastinated on. I have a meeting  scheduled with Rick Causey and will get up to speed on what exactly what has  transpired prior to that meeting. Thanks for giving this your immediate  attention. Rick

Update on  African deal  We are still awaiting confirmation on the background checks for the  counterparty - it seems unlikely that there is any link to government  agencies.  There is no proof that the Recycling management in Hamburg gave any direct  authorisation on this deal.  They do not see anything particularly wrong with  it either - to them this is completely different to the Indian deals as they  were not involved with preparing the documentation, merely accepting it from  a third party.  They see the car purchase (second hand Toyota) as a simple  payment mechanism rather than a bribe.  The instructions that they gave to their team in October was to cease all of  the Indian deals - they seem not to have applied an ethical motive to this,  but more a specific dictate covering India.    Doug Imrie is currently reviewing all other international deals and is  working through with Stephan Scheppler (the Manager of the Frankfurt office),  what will and will not be acceptable going forward. A list of written  instructions will be issued following this review.   We do not believe that any action against Stephan Scheppler will help to  achieve anything in terms of improvement in management going forward.  Under  German law it would probably be very difficult to prove that he has acted  against instructions (indeed he does not seem to have received the right  instructions).  We do believe that to tighten the top management organisation would provide a  firm and clear message to the management:  We can do this in two ways:  1.  To nominate Matz Heil (previously Bergman) to lead the 4 person  management team (currently they are all equal and have individual approaches) 2.  To have him reporting directly into Rob Soeldner in order to give the  commercial direction an Enron approach.  Joe will take steps to implement this when he returns from NY at the end of  this week.  At this point we will communicate the action to Houston.  Naomi

beck-s	 I have taken to heart your request that we try to mitigate operational risk.   Perhaps I have found another way to serve Energy Operations.  Arthur Andersen and Risk are sponsoring a conference on operational risk  (www.risk-conferences.com/oprisk2001).  The conference is composed of two  streams, one of which focuses on quantification and mathematical modeling  (neural networks, Bayesian models, and other statistical approaches).  The  quantitative approach to operational risk is akin to how VaR formalized and  quantified market risk.  It is also similar to the curve fitter that I wrote  (which uses mathematics to quantify how "good" or "bad" the back end of a  curve looks given the front end).    The conference is next Thursday and Friday (8-9) in New York (I just got the  notice today, so I am sorry for the short notice).  Would you like me to attend?  Regards,    Eugenio

The Calculaton for the  ERMS Discounting Reserve is currently performed  monthly by Risk Controls and  Reporting.  The December Reserve was ($7.8 million).    At an ERMS/TAGG meeting this morning,  Zhiyong Wei and Jeremy Wong said that  ERMS discounting could be corrected in two months.  Debbie Brackett, Chris  Abel and I suggested that April 1st may be the best time to implement.    Please advise Debbie, Chris or I of any concerns you may have with us  implementing this ERMS calculation correction for a April 1st date.

beck-s	 In December we entered two swaps on Enron stock to hedge out the exposure we  created by granting options.  We consider them trading securities, so I have  included them in the spreadsheet accordingly.  Gail Tholen explained to me that we have long term contracts to remove the  variability of revenues in Bammel Looper and Mid Texas.  I have changed the  total return swap model to use the volatility of prices in 2013 (when the  contracts expire), rather than spot volatilities.  As a result, December VaR  for total return swaps fell from $34 to $28 million.    With the partly offsetting effects of the new Enron stock and total return  swaps, December VaR for trading securities therefore fell from $70 to $68  million.    I recalculated total return swap VaR for the rest of 2000 using volatilities  for 2013.  Nevertheless, the impact is small, since spot volatilities were  not as high throughout the year as in December.  As a matter of fact, the  average, high, and low trading securities VaRs for 2000 remain largely  unchanged.  Regards,    Eugenio

beck-s	 We've done it again, everyone.   Enron has been named the "Most Innovative  Company in America" for the sixth consecutive year by Fortune.  That's right  -- six years in a row.   We continue to be recognized by our industry peers  and other corporate executives and securities analysts as the company that  sets the standard for doing business in the new economy.  Congratulations to  all of you for making it happen.  Enron placed No. 18 overall on Fortune's list of the nation's 535 "Most  Admired Companies," up from No. 36 last year.  We also were ranked among the  top five in "Quality of Management," "Quality of Products/Services" and  "Employee Talent."    This issue of Fortune is now available in airports and will be on newsstands  Monday, Feb. 12.  For more information, go to www.fortune.com.

beck-s	 As requested, I have come up with a rough estimate of the cost per trade for  Clickpaper (from a Product Control Group/Call Center prospective only).  The average cost per month for the team (fully loaded - salaries, benefits,  plus expenses) is $36,000.  The average number of trades per month is 40 -  therefore, the average cost $900 per trade.  As a comparison, the average cost per EnronOnline trade $3.00.  As you can  see, it is much lower due to the volume of transactions.  We will recognize  the same economies of scale when the Clickpaper trades increase.  We do not  anticipate needing any additional staff this year.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

beck-s	 We are currently in the process of creating a website for each of the book  administrators to maintain the Active/Inactive status of their books.  This  website will also will allow the book administrators to check their post id's  against active books.  All books will be identified by book administrator and  trading group.  The attached spreadsheet lists every book in RisktRAC,  provides what we currently believe the status (Active/Inactive) to be for  most books and some commodity codes associated with those books.   Additionally, there are two columns for book administrators and trading  groups, which are both empty.    In order for us to load the website with the most accurate data, we need for  each of you, as heads of your respective groups, to identify which books  belong to your book administrators and update the respective fields  associated with those books.  Refer to the following rules for updating  certain fields:  1)The book status should be Active, Inactive or Archive.  If a book has any  deals/positions that should be officialized, might affect VAR, and/or might  affect credit exposure then the book should have an Active status.  If the  book has no deals/positions, but the intent is to use the book sometime in  the near future, then the book should have an Inactive status.   If there are  no plans to continue using the book then it should have an Archive status.   Periodically, books marked as Archive will be removed from the website and  archived.  A request can be made to the Risk Controls group to have the book  unarchived and placed back on the website.   Any books that do not have a status updated will default to Active.  Any new  books set up and placed on the website will default to Active.  2)The Last Officialized and Commodity Code columns are provided to help you  and your group identify which books are yours and the book's status.  3)The Trading Group column should have your name next to each of the books  that your book administrators own.  This will allow you to query all books in  your trading group to check if all active books have post id's or if an  inactive book has a post id.  4)The Book Administrator column should have the name of the Book  Administrator responsible for the book.  This will allow you and the Book  Administrator to look at individual Book Administrator's books and post id's.  Once this website is up and running, each Book Administrator will be required  to update the Status of each of their books on a daily basis and the Book  Administrator on an as needed basis.  All of these changes will be made  directly on the website.    We are trying to get this process in place as quickly as possible, so please  return this information at your earliest convenience to my attention.  You  may call me at x33102 with any questions.  Thanks,  Chris Abel     
beck-s	 Per my voicemails to each of you....  Jenny Latham is currently a manager in Power Risk in Houston, and is  interested in moving to London.  She is very well respected within Enron, and  is a highly rated employee.  She has been with Enron for several years, in  various positions, and will move us far ahead in the staffing.  In January, I  met with Yvonne Scorer to identify recruiting needs to build the mid and back  office for the London activity for EIM.  One position identified, Business  Controller, is the position I have discussed with Jenny, and she is very  interested.  I am anxious to move this forward ASAP for a couple of reasons:   1).  Jenny is interested, and I do not want to lose her to other  opportunities within the London office, and 2).  It is not too early to move  forward on the staffing of the office as it will take some time to  appropriately staff and transition current support from EGM.  Bruce, last week Jenny and I met with you, and we discussed that it would be  appropriate for Jenny to spend time with us here in Houston to learn our  current processes, commoditiies, etc.  I absolutely agree with this, but we  need to make a deal with her before we can start that process.   The sequence  of events that make sense to me and that I believe would make Jenny the most  comfortable is that we 1).  agree on the financial package (Compensation,  moving allowance, etc), 2).  transition her current responsibilities within  Power Risk, and 3).  begin training with us.  Simultaneously, we will need to  recruit applicants for the remaining positions in Risk, Documentation,  Settlements and Trade Accounting.  My goal is to have everything in place in  London by the end of first quarter.    To meet this time line, we need to get more information and have a discussion  with Meryl on the specifics.  Bruce, can you give Meryl the green light to  move forward with us?  I appreciate your help.

I received an opportunity to meet you at a reception dinner that Enron hosted last semester in Austin.  I have always been intrigued with the analyst and associate rotational programs that Enron offers.  The courses I take in school, accounting and particularly finance, my extensive job experience, and my leadership positions have provided me with valuable skills for the summer analyst position.  I have a good friend at UT who will start working full-time for Enron in the IT division in a few months, and I know he is truly looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that Enron provides.  Because I am currently interning with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Houston, I am not able to go through the recruiting process at the university.  I am sending an attachment of my resume in this e-mail since I am going to be in Houston until mid-March. Please e-mail me if there are any openings for the position I am seeking or if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Thanks,  Judd Eisenberg   - Job Resume00-01.rtf

beck-s	 Please read the following message from Dan Reck regarding WebModal.  Thank  you.  ----- Forwarded by Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT on 02/14/2001 07:25 AM -----  	Daniel Reck 	02/13/2001 01:48 PM 		  		 To: Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc:  		 Subject: WebModal    At Monday's EGM meeting, Mike McConnell asked me to describe the WebModal  acquisition EGM made last week.  Following is a brief description of the  freight capacity market and what WebModal gets us:  Market  The US market for logistics is $600bn annually.  We are pursuing the largest  homogenous segment which is long-haul truckload and intermodal.  That market  is $50-$100bn annually, depending on who you ask and whether you include  dedicated fleets.  The interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely  fragmented and massively intermediated.  There are over 100,000 trucking  companies (carriers) in the US and thousands of independent brokers (brokers  in this market act as credit principals).  10-20% of all loads are conducted  in the spot market (brokered) and the rest are done under 1-3 year contracts  that are generally non-firm, but define the relationship between each shipper  and their chosen carriers or intermediaries.  On the rail side, the US railroads act as wholesalers, selling their capacity  to Intermodal Marketing Companies (IMCs).  The IMCs then retail or broker out  that capacity to shippers.  The difficult part of ground intermodal is that  the rail haul makes up only the long-haul component.   The trip from the  origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the  destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck.   This first and last mile transportation is called "drayage".    WebModal  WebModal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they  look identical to truck.  They have a database with prices and schedules from  all the RRs and 48 drayage companies that gives them complete US coverage.  A  buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive  instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service.  Because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail  and truck, the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is  significant.  For any move greater than 500 miles, intermodal is generally  20-30% less expensive than a single driver truck move.  The substitutability  of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price.  The WebModal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise  and a good head start as we enter this market.  The next move will be to  build a truck intermediation capability.    I encourage you to meet Chris Kravas the CEO of WebModal.  He will be  spending all of his time in Houston when he is not on the road.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Dan Reck

beck-s	 Hi, sistas-  Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:  We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.  Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.  I confirmed "17" with mom.  Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree, dessert) is $45. A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52. Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The food sounds really good.  So, here's a guess at cost: 17 people at $45 =  $765 Beverages =        $200 Gratuity =   $193 Valet =    $  50 Room rental =   $200 TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into thirds  What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara  Cara White Community Development Coordinator USTA Texas Section 1-888-883-6388 cWhite@texas.usta.com

Positives:  Seamless consolidation process with Enron worldwide  Common design allows users in North America to access key financial data to  help control London Metals business  accounts receivable  accounts payable  Aging of accounts receivable for proper control monitoring  Profit Center report functionality for controlling of business by business  group  Timing of close process in conjunction with Enron worldwide  Cost center control by category link by design to corresponding profit center  Cash control procedures utilizing the Treasury Work Station of Enron Corp.  Direct posting of intercompany accounts to reduce duplicate entries  Production of the Daily Profit Report direct from SAP utilizing the  consolidation ledger  SAP trail balance controlled by the ledger owner agrees with the DPR by  profit center  Negatives:  FIT 3 testing should be expanded in order to identify all types of business  flows and to evaluate how they are being treated in SAP.  NY did a two day  roll forward of equity which proved useful.  This type of testing could be  expanded for the London companies.  Poor links of information between GCP system and TWS created many manual  payments.  This problem is being sorted out by a process outside the SAP implementation  team.  Strict intercompany common design rules around intercompany relationships  have created a difficult control environment.  SAP intercompany meetings are being conducted to create a system that  adheres to the common design   however allows better intercompany control  features between broker and physical company.

beck-s	 The Following memo will be hand delivered to you in hard copy form on Tuesd= ay=20 morning, Feb. 20.  We will enclose the pledge form and=20 an Enron matching gifts form for your convenience.     Our meeting with Bob May, Dean of the McCombs School of Business at=20 UT-Austin, was a great success.  We had 14 attendees who received an update= =20 from Bob about the many great things going on in Austin, as well as=20 opportunities to participate in the =01&We=01,re Texas=018 capital campaign= .  After Bob=01,s presentation, the 14 Enron officers met separately and were= =20 extremely supportive about the idea of contributing in a coordinated manner= =20 to the McCombs School.  This was evidenced by an expression of intent in=20 giving totaling about $175,000 from just the 14 people!  Here is what we propose and how it would work.  1. The UT Alumni at Enron would pledge $1 million over four years to the=20 McCombs School.  This would consist of $500,000 of gifts from employees and=  a=20 matching $500,000 from Enron.  2. The matching program provided through the McCombs gift to the Business= =20 School would match the $1 million.  3. The result would be a permanently endowed $2 million =01&Enron Chair=018=  to=20 support =01&star quality=018 faculty for the school.  This will represent o= ne of=20 the largest Faculty Chairs at the Business School.  A few additional details:  1. Each individual=01,s contribution will also be credited to their name (a= long=20 with the Enron match) for recognition purposes in Business School=01,s Annu= al=20 Report, President=01,s Associates, etc.  In other words, a $10,000 contribu= tion=20 matched by Enron will be considered as a $20,000 contribution by that=20 individual for recognition purposes.  2. Enron has agreed to not count it=01,s match against an employee=01,s ann= ual=20 matching gift limitation of $15,000, as long as the gift is coordinated in = a=20 way that makes it a part of the =01&Enron Chair=018.  3.

beck-s	 I assume this meeting is strictly for Accenture and PWC to pitch their vision  to Enron on how they would help add value or help Enron execute mid/back  office and/or CommodityLogic in a commercial manner.  I don't want this  meeting related at all to Andy's efforts with Accenture related to  transaction feeds unless Andy thinks it is OK.  I have told Baldwin at Accenture that Mid/back office and CommodityLogic is  separate from what he is working on with Dave Samuals and Andy on Transaction  hubs and is separate from DealBench, etc.  If we are not careful, Accenture  will be working with four or five different points of contact at Net Works  and we will end up hurting ourselves.  I am counting on Salley, Rex, Andy and Tom ASAP to each understand what the  other is doing with Accenture and make sure there is no way Accenture can  work us to our disadvantage. I also think Accenture needs to earn our  business because others can do what they are offering.  Also, check with Rex Shelby on PWC.  We just had an uncomfortable experience  with PWC that everyone should understand.  I recommended an Accenture meeting  but if Tom wants PWC, he should understand what they did to Rex.  Remember, all of this is very confidential so let's be very careful  internally and no meetings without transaction specific NDAs.  Your thoughts?  I am out next week but will check voice mail daily at 36635.  Good luck.  GP   -----Original Message----- From:  Gros, Thomas D.

At Greg's suggestion, I am trying to arrange meetings with PwC (Pat Guzman,  Phil Greedy) and Accenture (Kenny Baldwin) on February 26 and/or 27 to see if  either of them represent good candidates to administer the hub. The meetings  will be held in the Enron building and should run about an hour.  My assistant will be contacting you/your assistants to coordinate these two  meetings.  All the best,  Tom 
beck-s	 Hi, Sal.   Just talked with Cindy and she said you're still trying to work out weekend plans.   I want to reiterate that, although it would be great to have you here, please don't make it too hard on yourself.  Don't pressure yourself to come; I will totally understand if you do not.   If you don't come this weekend, I bet you will be here soon anyway - because this tummy is sure to erupt in the near future!    Either way is great.  Just had to go get some more clothes (at Motherhood)  . . . since I am carrying all of my weight in my belly, it has expanded to epic proportions and I cannot fit into my pants!  Set up the baby bedding this weekend - it looks really cute!    But I couldn't figure out what do with the mattress pads (what do the cords fit around?)   Instead I put that cottony thing with the netting on as a mattress pad.   Is that what it is for?    I know you explained all of this to us in December, but we could not take it all in at that time!    love, c.

beck-s	 David, I met with Sally Beck this am to discuss our approach to evaluating,  identifying, and implementing the appropriate mid/back office processes for  EES. We have decided to use this "Doorstep" review as a means for our "swat"  team to get in quickly and have the necessary impact. Sally is putting  together the game plan with the team, their objectives, and timeline and will  have it to me this afternoon. Sally will manage this for us. You may want to  give Sally a call if you have questions re: exactly what/why we're doing  this. Thanks. 
beck-s	 Happy to help with Kristin's week of Doorstep work with EES. I'm glad she  will still be in the building/Houston however, because we are all working our  tails off up here - plenty of infrastructure work in progress.  On that - just a couple of other things to mention.  1. Kim/Leslie decided to keep Ellen W - with a revised/upgraded role - which  is good for Ellen. I think Ellen's disappointment was that they told her she  was 'good to go' on the Tuesday - and changed their minds on Wednesday -  invoking the '12 months' rule. However - Ellen seems over it - and is pleased  with her new role. Point to note - it took an external 'inquiry' to make them  realise what a potential diamond they had - maybe they may of seen it earlier  - just an observation.  2. I'm still a couple of good quality deal capture/documentation people  short. I would gladly take any quality candidates you may like to suggest.  3. EnFiber - our valuation/risk management engine (a cannabilised version of  EnPower) is up and running - and live.  Hope you are well.  B. 
beck-s	 Sally -  The IT group has developed a strategic plan for a single point of entry for  non-structured type deals.  (the less complex deals)  Dana Docherty called  yesterday to inform me that they have some resource issues and it may take  longer than they originally thought.  (One Month)  She also informed me that  Dave Nommenson would be responsible for the decisions on how quickly this  gets done.  I have left Dave a voicemail to stress the importance of this  issue in light of where gas is trading today.  Would you also mind letting  him know?  I think that this might allow him to better set his priorities.    Thanks for your help.  Jeff

beck-s	 I agree with your concerns.  I didn't go into all the specifics previously  because of the audience of the e-mail.  This is the intended procedure for  use of the dummy account:  Both the East and the West load gas books into the Enpower system nightly  (this is not one person's responsibility but the entire group's  responsibility). Previously, the only message we get for this load is a success that all the  books went somewhere in Enpower With the installation of the new 'dummy' account, the message will now tell  us if one of the books was loaded to this 'dummy' account If an EOL bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that was not  correctly mapped, the position would go to the 'dummy' account If an EOL bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that WAS  correctly mapped, the position would show up in that trader's gas positions Depending on which load (East or West) has a book that was mapped to the  'dummy' account will determine which group investigates (with IT) what &  whose positions are now stored in 'dummy'  As you have indicated, manual processes do inevitably create errors.  The  perfect procedure would be for the book to have complete and correct set up  prior to having deals entered into it.  It would also be ideal if deals could  not be entered into this book if setup was incomplete, but because this is an  interface mapping problem to Enpower, the TAGG (gas) system does not  recognize that the setup is incomplete.  I am not under the impression that  the 'dummy' account is a perfect fix; however, with the new 'alert' it will  provide us better data than we had before and it will keep the unmapped  positions out of the West portfolio.  The only time the West would be affected by this change in the future is if a  new power gas book is set up for your traders.  I hope I have addressed your concerns.  If I have not, please give me a call  or e-mail me back.  Thanks, Stacey (3-1870)    To: Stacey W White/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Potential Gas System Exposure    does any of this impact the west anymore?  who is going to be "alerted when  positions are loaded to the 'dummy' account."?  what's the procedure for  resolving?  what happens if eol dumps trades to a dummy account?  what  happens if the person who is watching the dummy account is out sick or on  vacation or leaves enron or is asleep at the wheel?  given the volatility of the commodities that we are trading and the fact that  manual processes inevitably create errors (as is evidenced by a $7 million  hit we took yesterday because one keystroke on deal entry was done  incorrectly last summer) i think it's important to raise these issues.      To: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John J Lavorato/Enron@EnronXGate, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Beth  Perlman/enron@EnronXgate, Steve Nat/Enron@EnronXGate, Sheri  Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Potential Gas System Exposure    The mapping problem mentioned below is a power desk problem only.  The  mapping problem is purely between the interface of the gas and power trading  systems and does not affect the book if it is strictly a gas trader's gas  book.  There was one instance when a gas trader's transactions were  incorrectly bridged to a power trader's gas book through EOL.  The root of  this problem was with the EOL bridge not the interface mapping.  The procedure to set up a gas book for power traders includes communication  to IT regarding the appropriate interface mapping of the book.  If for some  reason the mapping does not occur, the position will be mapped to a 'dummy'  default desk.  We will be alerted when positions are loaded to the 'dummy'  account on a nightly basis in order to investigate the problem and ensure  that positions do no get lost in the system.    If anyone needs to further discuss the problem we have been having and why it  is only the power world that is affected, please give me a call.

I have worked with our risk team and the techology group to get West  Power out of this problem.  I'm happy with the result from the West Power  point of view.    I am writing to alert you that one half of the problem still exists.  If  someone does a gas deal and hasn't set up a new book properly and doesn't  carefully track his/her position, the trade goes into a dummy book that  nobody manages.  Days, weeks, or months later you discover the trade and take  the hit or the gain.  I think that this risk is real because we were the ones  finding the misplaced gas trades before -- not the gas desk with the  misplaced trade.  Now nobody will find them unless the gas trader realizes  that some of his/her position is missing.  These are the facts as I understand them.  I'm sure that Stacey White, Steve  Nat, and Monica Lande could fill you in with more detailed information.  Let  me know if I can be of further assistance. ---------------------- Forwarded by Tim Belden/HOU/ECT on 02/14/2001 02:18 PM  ---------------------------   Monica Lande 02/14/2001 02:34 PM To: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Fran Chang/PDX/ECT@ECT, Valarie Sabo/PDX/ECT@ECT, Samantha  Law/PDX/ECT@ECT  Subject: RE: Remaining problem with West tot    Tim,  Steve has described the problem accurately.  Setting up a dummy book solves  the problem for us, but not for Enron as a whole.  If no one monitors the  dummy book on the daily basis (which probably won't happen if there is no  ownership), then you still have the possibility of positions falling into  that book and never showing up in the book that they were intended.

If mapping logic is not set up for a new book, the job was  defaulting the gas deals to the ST-PLT desk.  The default mapping has been  changed to a dummy  ZZ_erms book, which will prevent the deals from showing  up in the wrong book if the mapping logic is not updated.  In reference to Beth's concerns... turns out this was a limitation in our  production code, not an IT change to production data, so we should be OK on  that front.    The long-term solution would be to remove the hard-coded logic, set-up table  structures, and maintain the mapping rules through a user screen.  Given our  other priorities, and the default logic change, we will not pursue this  option.  Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

To: Beth Perlman/ENRON@enronXgate @ ENRON cc: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Nat/ENRON@enronXgate@ENRON  Subject: RE: Remaining problem with West tot   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >>   The problem is not that we should enter a reversing trade in the system as  this would misrepresent the positions across the board.  The problem is that  the position belongs to another book within Enpower.  The users have no  access to the screens which define where our gas books are mapped in Enpower;  therefore, IT has to manually define the correct mapping for us.  When the  manual fix has not been made, we have true positions for one book mapped to  another book.

Regards  Mike    ISSUE  The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20 (OBSF) pre year-end to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios.  Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being= =20 bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o= f=20 which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t= he=20 hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially= =20 took place on spreadsheets.  The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20 should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20 balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement= s,=20 particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in= =20 the AS400.

This has given rise to the following concerns:  ?

beck-s	 I organized our thoughts from yesterday into an outline we can follow.  This  also gives us a place to start to record our facts/assumptions as we identify  them.  I moved the document into O:/Energy_Ops/OPM Hours Survey for now so we  can all access. 
beck-s	 Sally, as per your request here is Global Outsourcing's current status in  regard to EES:   GLOBAL  COUNTERPARTY -     Priority #1 Counterparties (EES Counterparties that have $100,000 or more  AR or AP exposure)  -    506          Counterparties entered in GCP  506  -  100% complete   These Priority #1 CP's were completed in 55 days.    Priority #2 Counterparties (EES Counterparties that have $75,000 or more AR  or AP exposure)  -      703          Counterparties entered in GCP to date -     35  -  5% complete   All Priority # 2 CP's will be completed within 45 days ( March 23, 2001).  EES has approximately 14,000 counterparties to be entered into the GCP  Database.  We have been dealing with EES' Karin Williams and  Scott Mills on  the GCP set up.  We have quoted EES a rate of $20.00 per counterparty entered into the GCP  Database.  We currently have 4 people working full time on the research,  calling and entering of EES's CP's.  Beginning in January 2002, we anticipate  utilizing a mutually agreed upon monthly fee.  Jason Moore and I are the designated Global contacts for EES in regard to GCP.     GLOBAL  CONTRACTS  AND  GLOBAL  FACILITIES -    In a February 16th meeting with Wanda Curry, Scott Mills, Mark Evans, and  other EES personnel, EES indicated that they were leaning towards utilizing  the Global Contracts Database.  We briefly discussed the Global Facilities  Database, but we all have agreed to concentrate on the feasibility of the  Contracts Database first and leave the Facilities implementation question for  a later date.    As a result of the above mentioned meeting, we have an EES Demo set up for  tomorrow morning from 9 A.M. - 12 P.M. in order to give EES personnel a  "hands on" demonstration of the functionality of Global Contracts.  A   portion of EES's contracts include multiple commodities and staggering  agreement terms that Global Contracts is now unable to capture.  Therefore,  we will need to institute numerous system enhancements, with the co-operation  of Global IT, in order to process EES' contracts.  The timing and IT manpower  needs of these system enhancements will be discussed at our Demo by Global IT  personnel.  If EES does agree to utilize Global Contracts and Facilities we will need to  set up a separate EES maintenance group within Global.    EES has informed us that they would like to do all of their Contracts Data  input.  Therefore, we anticipate the use of 3 Global Contracts personnel for  the training of EES'  personnel.  Two Global employees would be assigned to  work directly with EES's personnel on a daily basis.  The remaining Global  Contracts person would act as a "Help Desk" here on 37 to answer any Global  Contracts questions.   In regard to billing EES for the Global Contracts Database assistance, we are  proposing the use of a "flat rate"  monthly fee structure, similar to the one  utilized  for Bridgeline Gas Pipeline.   We would also include a "start up"  fee to cover the cost of the initial  IT system enhancements.  Donna Consemiu and I will be the designated Global contacts for EES in regard  to Global Contracts and Facilities.

beck-s	 Hello, sistas-  Just visited with the coordinator of Josephine's House.   Here's some additional info. - and we have a few questions to answer:  1) I have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual charge until the day of the event.  2) For a party of our size, they will offer a choice of soup or salad, 3 entrees and 2 desserts.   If we have a special request, we can let her know; otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the Jeffery's chef has cookin' that night.  3) We need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group.    Preferences?  4) At some point, we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in addition to the three course meal.   She suggested oysters (for which they are famous) and then some other, non-seafood appetizer.  These would be served as guests arrive.  5)  She is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in advance of the event.   Also, she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in addition to wine.   I told her I'd check with you - but that we wouldn't be a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine.    I thought we might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime during the meal (maybe dessert?) in case we want to give a toast to the happy couple.  Thoughts, everyone?      -the youngest and fattest  Cara White Community Development Coordinator USTA Texas Section 1-888-883-6388 cWhite@texas.usta.com

beck-s	 Funny...This did not get mentioned in our meeting with Dave. ---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT on 03/12/2001  05:19 PM --------------------------- From: Zhiyong Wei/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/12/2001 05:10 PM To: Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Single deal entry  Jeff,  I just found out that the development of phase1 single deal entry project  didn't start as scheduled due to resource constraints. Therefore, the  development won't be done until mid of April. Sorry for the delay. I will  make sure to deliver it to you for testing by the middle of April. After  consulting Russ and Sitara-TDS team, the phase1 single deal entry will allow  users to enter simple types of physical deals at deal creation time. It does  not provide any editing functionality. In other words, once the deals are  saved to the system, any changes need to be done through both TAGG and  Sitara. Please see below for a short list of complex deals that are not going  to be captured in phase1. Russ helped me put the list together.   Deal Types not Captured in the Phase1-Single-Deal-Capture  1. Deals with multiple locations each of which has different cost of gas  because TAGG does not capture location information. For example, a  10-location deal will result in 1 Sitara deal with 10 CPR   tickets and 10  TAGG legs. Each Tagg leg capturing the risk between contract price and mid  for that location. 2. Structured deals which have different volume for different months and  whose different risk components will be managed by different desks. 3. Tiered pricing structured deals that require one Sitara ticket and more  than one TAGG ticket. For example, 15,000 deal volume in broken down to 5,000  at fixed price, 5,000 at NYMEX - 0.10 and 5,000 at the index. 4. Physical options because TDS deal capture does not handle physical  options.  5. Trigger deals that allow setting prices before index settles.  Basic  trigger deal can be captured.  Entry problem relates if price trigger is  managed in a different book, or if different volume is triggered or  untriggered, than the original deal volume. 6. Physical index deals with the index that is different from the mid for the  location. Such deals need to be broken down into an index, a long basis and a  short basis in TAGG. 7. Percentage index deals that require two legs in TAGG. One leg is index  flat and the other is fixed price deal with zero fixed price and zero basis  and reduced quantity. For example, a 90% index deal with a quantity of 5000  can be broken down into one leg of index flat and the other leg of zero  fixed-price and zero basis and a quantity of 5000*0.1 = 500. 8. Floating basis deals.  Deals can be entered with a price and physical  premium component where the basis will default to the actual basis settle.  These deals are sometimes entered as trigger deals with a floating basis.   The deal looks like a straight index deal, however the price can be triggered  and the basis will default to actual.     I would appreciate your comments.  Zhiyong

Subject: CGI Related Target for Orig.  Philippe, Greg, Rex -  We have followed up with CGI on their "secret" target for our applications.   It is CMS Energy across town.   They will be presenting a careful (and short) concept proposal  to them on the 26th of March.  Initial feedback on Enron being part of the solution was very positive by the  business owner of the rearchitecture.  Apparently, there is a significant process flow rework going  on at the same time and the business owner reports to the CEO on both topics.  We are in early in the process so there is room to still influence the  overall approach they take, according to CGI.     David

We welcome your feedback, so if you have any questions or comments regarding  the new Intranet site and the reports posted there, please contact Peter  Berzins at x57597 or Bryan Deluca at x36161.   Thank you,  Torrey Moorer Manager, EOL Product Control Group Reporting 	 	   Notes for this Week's Report:  *  North American Gas has kept its overall average daily EOL deal count  steady at about 2,950 trades a day since January.  This is about 180 trades a  day less than the November average of 3,130, which is still the Life to Date  high.  The overall average daily EOL volumes have remained steady as well.  *  The East and Central Regions of North American Gas have been the main  reason EOL Gas transactions have remained steady.  The East Region has  increased its overall average daily EOL deal count by about 20% since  January, from 632 to 798 deals per day.  The Central Region has increased its  overall average daily EOL deal count by about 50% since January, from 676 to  1,018 deals per day.  *  US Power trading via EOL has now levelled off to average daily EOL Deal  Count of about 452 deals per day.   This is mostly up from 181 deals per day  in December, to 340 in January, to 449 in February.  In addition, the average  daily Non-EOL Deal Count has also levelled off at about 483 deals per day.   The average daily EOL volumes have remained fairly steady.  *  US East Power trading via EOL has now dropped off since February.  It has  decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 13% since February, from  359 deals per day to 313.  In addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count  has now decreased by about 7% since February, from 269 to 250 deals per day.   The average daily EOL volumes have remained steady.  *  UK Gas trading has continued to see a steady increase since December on  EOL.  They were averaging close to 51 transactions per day in December 2000.   Recently they have been climbing to 81 deals per day in January, 111 in  February, and now 167 in March.  This represents about a 227% increase.  *  LPG's has decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a consistent 450  trades or so from November through January, to only 250 trades in the month  of February, and only about 84 trades so far in the month of March .  This  represents about a 62% decrease from previous months.  The total monthly EOL  volumes have decreased similarly as well.  *  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has increased since February, from a  daily average of 497 to a daily average of 629 for March.  This represents  about a 27% increase.  The average daily EOL volumes have increased as well.  --------------- The following files contain a graphical view of the average deal count and  volumes per month by Commodity for EOL and OTC transactions since the launch  of EnronOnline.

Fred and Rahil are working on getting volumes for  your group to estimate the marginal cost per transaction at different volume  levels. We will use that information to estimate the cost side going forward.  On the revenue side I believe that it can be misleading to use a cost plus  approach and that we will be better off estimating the price counterparties  are willing to pay for the service based on market comparables from the  benchmarking studies Sally contracted a while ago. We will also take into  account for pricing other variables as the contingent liability risks that  they are avoiding by outsourcing their back office function and the issue of  information confidentiality.

beck-s	 Everyone,  This is what CGI forwarded me this morning with regards to a potential  partnering agreement with Enron to respond to the RFP sent out for  development of Back-Office systems.  The idea is for us to license our  "source-code' for the mid/back-office technology to CGI, who will then tweak  it to build a system for their customers.  At this point in time, we have not  made any commitments, whatsoever, and are planning to do so only if this can  be done with minimal hand-holding from us (given our other project  commitments).  Please read through the Teaming Agreement at your earliest so we can all  discuss any revisions you may want made.  As CGI will be responding to this RFP today with potential support from ENW  (i.e. our code would be one of the key selling points), they had requested  some basic information on Enron, which we provided to them late last week.   This will be bundled with company specific information for CGI, that will be  provided as part of the Response to RFP.     Beth, I've also left a message for you with Blanca.  Lets talk when you get a  chance so we can discuss this and other things sometime today.

Mutual non-solicitation agreement will not be accepted by Enron.  It is corporate policy not to enter into these agreements because they are unenforceable internally (we are just too large and recruit too many people to track them).  Certainly, we will not use the partnership to recruit your people, but can not commit to that in writing.    Second, the term of the confidentiality agreement is quite long (3 years).  In the high tech world this is considered a quite long.  I think our attorneys like to keep these shorter (again for tracking purposes).  If we can make it 2 years and remove the mutual non-solicitation, I will forward it.  - Steve     - Teaming Agreement.doc

Cindy and her team will also have the  critical responsibility of ensuring proper controls and processes are  maintained for all new and existing markets throughout the region.  Tiong  Hock Lim and his team in Singapore will report to Cindy.  Financial Commodity Operations Sheila Glover will expand her current role and manage all business risk and  operational activities for Financial Trading and Global Risk Management.  As  the Global Risk Management business grows, Sheila will develop the  operational processes and infrastructure necessary to support it.  Todd, Michelle, Cindy and Sheila will also work together as a Controller team  to ensure processes and controls are consistent across EGM and that  efficiencies are broadly applied.  Structuring/Transaction Analysis Scott Earnest will assume responsibility for all commodity structuring and  transaction analysis activities across EGM.  His duties will include pricing  and valuation of new transactions and businesses, evaluation of existing  transactions to identify restructuring opportunities and risk controls  monitoring and reporting.    Technology Kevin Sweeney will continue in his role as Technology Controller.  Kevin and  his team will be completing the implementation of Project Thunderball for  Crude & Products and Coal and will also serve as the Business Leads for  system enhancements and new technology opportunities that are identified.  Financial Operations & Accounting Tom Myers will continue in his role of managing EGM Financial Operations &  Accounting.

beck-s	 Let's meet in the next few days to discuss this issue of other groups selling  your services as long as you are the desk, get to price and structure all the  deals and make your quote with an appropriate margin in every deal.  Clearly  we would have to initially put together a product menu for the EA group so  they can understand what they are pitching as well as designate a person from  your group to work with them so that the story gets told accurately to the  potential customers.  Thanks.  GP

beck-s	 FYI these are the standards we are putting out there for GCP worldwide   (draft at the moment -- to initiate a debate)  some of the standards are quite "lofty" but I think we can get there.

The object of  these standards is to set out the best practices of the Global Counterparty  group for all locations (Houston, Calgary, London, Southern Cone).  We are seeking your input to ensure that the Standards properly reflect a  London GCP perspective.  We - Bill Hare, James Scribner and myself - have  compiled a draft of the Standards which is attached below.    It's important to note that the Standards detail some procedures we have  always carried out, and some that we are working towards.  The intention of  setting Fundamental Operating Standards is to agree on and document common  objectives for GCP.   With this in mind, we look forward to receiving your  comments on and suggestions for the draft.  If you have any questions please phone me on the numbers below.

beck-s	 During my meeting with Kathryn Cordes the other day, I mentioned to her that I was having lunch with Mirant (formerly Southern Company Energy Mktg.) and wanted to know the status of any contact that Tom Gros may have had with them so that I would know how to handle my discussions with them.  Early on, we had asked that CommodityLogic  target companies like AEP and Mirant for ConfirmLogic.  Kathryn mentioned that they were also thinking of talking to El Paso.  Tom called me yesterday and asked for a contact name at El Paso.  I told him about my planned lunch with Mirant as well.  He asked me to get a contact name for Mirant as well.    I received some information from Mirant today that actually helps our case for ConfirmLogic.  They informed me that they have just visited with AEP regarding deals transacted on the Intercontinental Power Exchange (ICE) platform (Mirant is a stakeholder in that trading platform).  AEP wants to eliminate confirmations for trades on that platform and want the Automatch function.  He said that AEP's IT dept. is ready to take that step.  He also made the comment that Mirant's IT dept. is very lacking and is not ready to perform the automatch function.  He did say that they would be receptive to verifying the deal information electronically and eliminating the confirmations. He felt that technology wise, they were 3 years behind where we are.     Our advantage is that we want to automatch the entire universe of deals (Broker, EOL, Direct trades, trades done on other platforms (i.e. Dynegy Direct, ICE, etc.)) rather than just a subset of deals (i.e. Trades done on ICE as AEP suggested).  Just want to pass this on to you to see if you had any concerns about providing this information to Tom.  I was planning on sending him an email tomorrow to give him the contact information.  Let me know.  Kim Theriot

I will be in Austin  interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be  the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top  MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR  for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our  recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners  and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron  Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview  team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages  during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.     I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be  the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia  School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is  a short one.

I've got some suggestions below and would like to hear any that you have:  In order to maintain coordination and control of the information - for the betterment of us all - I think we ought to give one person version control responsibility over the model.  This person should be advised when the model is updated.  Relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons for the updating also seem pertinent.  Version control is critical if we are to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management.    Related to this, Rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to upper management (both Sally and Greg) and be given the opportunity to give feedback before hand.    Just basic stuff, but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we go much further, we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications.  Thanks,  Fred 5-9323

beck-s	 A quick update on a major milestone for the Unify effort, the critical  success factors and the plan for the Gas and Power deliveries.   First, the good news --- We rolled out the new Unify Financials system on  Monday. The rollout so far is very nearly a flawless success. Only 2 small  bugs have been identified and both were fixed within 1 day. The users in  Houston and London have commented that the system is noticeably faster. This  system was delivered 4 weeks ahead of the original schedule that we published  in early January. For a project of this size and complexity, this is great  news and bodes well for the next 2 major milestones.  We're not out of the woods yet. Our biggest and most risky rollouts are a few  weeks away - Power and Gas.  Even so, as we look ahead, we are very optimistic. Based on our empirical  load testing, we believe that we can now deliver incremental performance  increases and long-term scaleability far beyond what the legacy architecture  would support. Reliability and stability should continue to increase beyond  the recently improved performance we've gotten from the new legacy hardware.   This milestone success is due to the following critical factors:   ? Strong Executive IT sponsorship and participation (Special thanks to  Philippe Bibi, Beth Perlman, Jenny Rub, Bob McAuliffe, Richard Burchfield) ? Strong Executive User sponsorship and user participation (Special thanks to  Sally Beck, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Sheila Glover, Cindy Horn, Peggy  Hedstrom and Laura Scott) ? Adoption of a risk-managed delivery methodology based on detailed planning  and a phased delivery approach ? A talented Enron delivery team with great technical skills and the  dedication to work nearly every weekend for the last 2 months (and the next  2)  ? Exemplary partnering between the Infrastructure, Application, DBA and User  teams  ? Uncompromising commitments to team success from the vendors (Special thanks  to Microsoft, Accenture, Compaq, Avenade) ? Focused project management (Special thanks to Ramesh Rao, Dale Potter, Mike  Croucher and Jim Ogg).    The attachment below provides a calendar of activities for everything that's  happening between now and mid-May. Power will go live on April 23 and Gas  will go live on May 21. The user bid-week simulation and performance tests  for gas begin next week. As the calendar below shows, the team is fully  occupied for the next 2 months.    Livelink:   http://edms.livelink.enron.com/ena/livelink.exe?func=ll&objId=8743122&objActio n=browse&sort=name   Thanks to everyone for their help in achieving this milestone as well as your  continued support as we push to deliver Power and Gas with the same level of  success. Please communicate our gratitude to each member of your respective  teams.

We have just been told that we will    not have access to the customer tables to add new customers and that    this must be accomplished through Enron.  If this is true, it is not    acceptable.  Could we please discuss? [Yanowski, Tommy J.]  In our original proposal, when we offered up a long  term service deal the fee structure covered us setting up a totally seperate  environment for HPL/AEP.  It would take somewhere between $3 - $5 MM in  hardware to duplicate our environment for HPL.  You guys came back and said  you just wanted something for an interim time period at a lower cost.  It was  then that we offered letting you use our applications running on our boxes  and on the same database.  Most of our applications have enough application  and database level security that we can keep Enron's data seperate from  HPL/AEP's.  There are two applications, ERMS & CPR where we felt it necessary  to create a duplicate environment due to security concerns.  Remember  security cuts both ways and we don't want you looking at Enron's data just as  much as you don't want Enron looking at yours.  Never the less the hardware  to run these two applications plus setting up the terminal server environment  plus the resource time is costing us about $500 K.  Hence the charge for set  up costs.  There are three areas where Enron and AEP will be sharing data.   They are in the global reference data area:  Global Common Codes:  Your codes for MMBtu and US Dollars will be the same as  ours.  Global Facilities:  Your access to Pipeline, meter numbers and DRN Numbers  will be the same as ours.  All of this information is public knowledge and is  provided to us via IHS Energy who is the GISB certified provider of this  information to the industry.  You will have the ability to update you own  meter information.  Global Counterparties:  You will be sharing customer names and addresses such  as those for settlements or statements with Enron.  We can identify within  the Counterparty system who uses which address.  In that way we can filter  the view to the business units so that they only see those customers that  they deal with.  The process for HPL/AEP is the same that is used across  Enron.  Our retail business units only see their customers and ENA only see  theirs.  The reason we only have one group updating this information is  because if EES starts doing business with someone who is already a customer  of ENA then we wouldn't want to duplicate that customer information.  It  helps us roll up total credit exposure across Enron for a customer.  The  people who update this information are seperate from the rest of the business  units and are instructed not to share any customer information even though  most of it is public knowledge if you look up that customer on the internet.   Let me know in detail what your concern is.  The ENA trading community will  not know who your customers are and vice versa.  They will not know what  addresses you use and vice versa.  There are only a few people across Enron  who can find out this information and they are Enron Net Works employees who  provide this service to all of Enron as well as the 3rd Party customers we  are providing IT services for.  You will have a web interface to view your  own customer information and to request updates or additions.     It looks like we will need access to DCAF in order to send out    confirmations for physical contracts executed on behalf of HPL.  Do you    foresee any problems with this? [Yanowski, Tommy J.]  We can provide confirms for those spot and 30 day deals  that hit Sitara and DCAF II.  All this is set up and is ready to go.  Long  Term and financial deals for Enron also flow into TAGG and into ERMS.  It is  from TAGG that Long Term and Financial confirmations are generated via DCAF  I.  I had been told that you will not be using ERMS for Forward Risk and  would be confirming deals out of ZAINET so we did not set up a seperate TAGG  and DCAF I environment to go with the seperate ERMS and CPR environment  needed for Intramonth valuation.  We need to talk about this ASAP.  I need to  understand what if anything you will be confirming out of ZAINet.  If you  want to change your mind this late in the game and let Enron Confirm   everyting except for financial deals then I need to know ASAP so that we can  begin scrambling to see if we can set this up in time.  We actually have put  in code to block generating HPL/AEP confirms that now needs to be removed.      Also-  I extended offers to Ken Ellerman and Greg Lind yesterday with a start date to be mutually determined and worked out between you and me. [Yanowski, Tommy J.]  Thanks for letting me know.  Have you communicated  anything to Dave Stadnick.  I probably need to talk to him and let him know  how much we need him but it would be nice for me to know what he is aware of  before I meet with him.   Kindest Regards, Don  
beck-s	 The below email is in regards to the cost charts Sheri asked that I provide  to Greg Piper.  The comment, "The goal for us is to put the information into  a form that I can share with potential external counterparties on Tuesday" is  why I am forwarding the email to you.  I will dig deeper to understand the  purpose.  Also, Sally the gas chart is for both Financial and Physical and  the increase in cost for February is due to social security and unemployment  taxes.  These cost were incorrectly recorded to our cost centers and will be  reversed during March.   ---------------------- Forwarded by James Scribner/Corp/Enron on 04/02/2001  10:05 AM --------------------------- From: Rex Shelby/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/31/2001 03:38 PM To: Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Berberian/ENRON@enronXgate cc: James Scribner/Corp/Enron@Enron, Rex Shelby/ENRON@enronXgate   Subject: RE: Cost/Revenue information  Hi Sheri --  I hope your Mom's surgery went fine.

beck-s	 Sally,  Thanks for our meeting last week.  Please let me know if you don't think  we've sufficiently defined the deliverable for Business Ops.  Based on  feedback from Louise - you and I still may not be clearly communicating yet  as to what is required.  Specifically, AEP and Enron need to agree in writing for each Business Ops  "process" or function:  1. Who is going to carry out the Business Ops processes before and after  close. 2. How control over the process will be handed over from Enron to AEP. 3. The necessary IT actions required to put the required system functionality  in place (and who is responsible for implementing this).   The table you developed at the end of last week (based on Bob's email) moves  closer to this point.   As we discussed on the phone, we need to provide a  description of the deliverables for each of the "systems/activities" you  listed on the table and ensure that AEP understands (and signs off on) what  they are responsible for.  To Anne's point, this "sign off" can be through a  memo, protocol, acknowledged email, or other.    We have been having a problem in that one part of AEP does not talk to the  other part.  So, I would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual Bob  Hall/Steve Jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of AEP (and Enron)  understand what is being agreed before we close.  Each Tuesday at 4:00 we have a standing HPL Transition Coordination meeting  to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group.   You are welcome  to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each  Wednesday with Bob H. and Tommy Y. to concentrate on HPL/IT/Business Ops  matters.  Sally,  thanks for you personal attention to this.      The quicker we close the quicker Bob can focus more of his time on Network's  origination efforts.  Regards, Brian              	Enron North America Corp. 	 	From:  Sally Beck                           03/30/2001 03:34 PM 	  To: Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Bob M Hall/NA/Enron@Enron, Leslie Reeves/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anne C  Koehler/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anne C Koehler/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List  I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of  what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.   Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol"  into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not  anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply  e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of  information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.   Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled  exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron)  to Steve Jackson (AEP).    Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally  documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the  original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for  gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury  group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband  in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an  Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to  that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's  Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the  amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.    We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition  issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of  you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have  to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require  actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we  will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list  or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we  will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or  memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your  requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you  weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and  AEP.    I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update  on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest  that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:    1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so  that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and  their status, or    2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a  firsthand update to the two of you.    Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can  incorporate that into our schedules for next week.      
beck-s	 There are a couple of items that I wanted to update you on with respect to  our outsourcing arrangements and staffing.  First, the outsourcing  arrangement with Petro-Canada has been extended for an additional five-year  term.  The commercial guys are very happy about this and have given a lot of  credit to Energy Operations and Accounting for the successful renewal of this  agreement.  Secondly, we have an existing outsourcing agreement with Startech Energy for  volumes totaling 8 - 10 MMcf/d.  These properties have been purchased by a  company called ARC.  The existing MSA for Startech properties is being  terminated and a new agreement covering all of ARC's production is in the  final stages of negotiation.  Starting in May/June, the volumes under this  new arrangement will be between 50 - 60 MMcf/d.  This increased volume and  associated receipt points creates the need to add one person to the Logistics  group.  This position was not budgeted for, however,  I have received  approval from Rob Milnthorp to add this position.  Please let me know if you  have any concerns about this net staff addition.  Thanks Peggy 
beck-s	 Good summary of Canadian process.  Once George, Bob and I meet, I will give the group and update.  thansk  bob ---------------------- Forwarded by Bob M Hall/NA/Enron on 04/02/2001 03:47  PM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  George F Smith @ ECT                           04/02/2001 02:34 PM 	  To: Robert Superty/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bob M Hall/NA/Enron@Enron cc:    Subject: Canadian Outsourcing Deals  I met with Peggy Hedstrom and to some extent with Laura Scott  in Calgary  regarding how they handle the day to day activity of their producer  outsourcing deals.   The producer provides to EC their projected production schedule for the year  by month by plant outlet. This information is entered into Sitara by EC on a  single ticket with no meter information. For the prompt month EC confirms  back to the producer their expected production volumes by point by day. This  includes any maintenance or scheduled down time that would affect their daily  flows. This information is contained within a Excel spreadsheet which can be  viewed by the producer via a common network drive.  The producer communicates to EC their sales for the month and on a daily  basis. EC enters these trades in Sitara. The Sitara position by producer is  balanced to zero daily. The producer does not have access to Sitara.  EC acts as agent for the downstream transportation owned by producer. They  have no diversion rights on this transport, it is utilised at the direction  of the producer. EC nominates producers transport. All transport expense  estimates are maintained by EC. EC is invoiced and pays the pipeline.  EC monitors estimated hourly flows from the plant outlets as provided by  Nova. It is the responsibility of EC to inform the producer of significant  variances in their scheduled versus estimated flows. Nova requires that  shippers be balanced on a daily basis or face penalties if variances are out  of tolerance. It is EC's responsibility to keep the producer out of penalty  situations. The producer, at the direction of EC, either sells or buys on an  intraday basis to balance their position on the pipeline. Final estimated  flows are then downloaded by EC into the Excel spreadsheet. This final  estimate is than used as the expected volume for the upcoming day.  And  Sitara is updated accordingly.  At months end the spreadsheet information is transferred to an accounting  system referred to as Solomon. Actual volumes as provided by the pipeline are  also entered into the system for settlement. I didn't have a lot of time to  devote to the accounting process, but I doubt ENA would take this approach.  EC utilises a single point of contact with each producer from a logistics and  origination standpoint. Peggy said they did not hire people specifically from  the producer/customers but did seek out people with extensive producer  experience to assist with these customers. Peggy feels that their success is  due in a large part to the very strong relationships they have developed with  their customers through this point of contact approach.  It is of note that Unify is not utilised in managing these customers  business. Peggy feels that Unify is not  designed to handle it and response  time is too slow for their purposes given the time constraints they are  working under on a daily basis.

The reason we only have one group updating this information is be= cause if EES starts doing business with someone who is already a customer o= f ENA then we wouldn't want to duplicate that customer information.  It hel= ps us roll up total credit exposure across Enron for a customer.  The peopl= e who update this information are seperate from the rest of the business un= its and are instructed not to share any customer information even though mo= st of it is public knowledge if you look up that customer on the internet. =  Let me know in detail what your concern is.  The ENA trading community wil= l not know who your customers are and vice versa.  They will not know what = addresses you use and vice versa.  There are only a few people across Enron=  who can find out this information and they are Enron Net Works employees w= ho provide this service to all of Enron as well as the 3rd Party customers = we are providing IT services for.  You will have a web interface to view yo= ur own customer information and to request updates or additions.     It looks like we will need access to DCAF in order to send out    confirmations for physical contracts executed on behalf of HPL.  Do you    foresee any problems with this? [Yanowski, Tommy J.]  We can provide confirms for those spot and 30 day dea= ls that hit Sitara and DCAF II.  All this is set up and is ready to go.  Lo= ng Term and financial deals for Enron also flow into TAGG and into ERMS.  I= t is from TAGG that Long Term and Financial confirmations are generated via=  DCAF I.  I had been told that you will not be using ERMS for Forward Risk = and would be confirming deals out of ZAINET so we did not set up a seperate=  TAGG and DCAF I environment to go with the seperate ERMS and CPR environme= nt needed for Intramonth valuation.  We need to talk about this ASAP.  I ne= ed to understand what if anything you will be confirming out of ZAINet.  If=  you want to change your mind this late in the game and let Enron Confirm  = everyting except for financial deals then I need to know ASAP so that we ca= n begin scrambling to see if we can set this up in time.  We actually have = put in code to block generating HPL/AEP confirms that now needs to be remov= ed.   =20  Also-  I extended offers to Ken Ellerman and Greg Lind yesterday with a start date to be mutually determined and worked out between you and me. [Yanowski, Tommy J.]  Thanks for letting me know.  Have you communicated an= ything to Dave Stadnick.  I probably need to talk to him and let him know h= ow much we need him but it would be nice for me to know what he is aware of=  before I meet with him.   Kindest Regards, Don  
beck-s	 There are a couple of items that I wanted to update you on with respect to our outsourcing arrangements and staffing.  First, the outsourcing arrangement with Petro-Canada has been extended for an additional five-year term.  The commercial guys are very happy about this and have given a lot of credit to Energy Operations and Accounting for the successful renewal of this agreement.  Secondly, we have an existing outsourcing agreement with Startech Energy for volumes totaling 8 - 10 MMcf/d.  These properties have been purchased by a company called ARC.  The existing MSA for Startech properties is being terminated and a new agreement covering all of ARC's production is in the final stages of negotiation.  Starting in May/June, the volumes under this new arrangement will be between 50 - 60 MMcf/d.  This increased volume and associated receipt points creates the need to add one person to the Logistics group.  This position was not budgeted for, however,  I have received approval from Rob Milnthorp to add this position.  Please let me know if you have any concerns about this net staff addition.  Thanks Peggy

beck-s	 Sally / Beth,  As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on  Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged  for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads  up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last  minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we  can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so  there is going to be no further progress on this front.  In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put  together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this  stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC  perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I  am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at  least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will  also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people  with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?  I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston  (and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding  list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be  completed as part of the curve validation   If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.  James

beck-s	 After meeting with AEP this morning, some issues are revolved and new one added.  Resolved:  	Confirmations will be done out of AEP's systems for long term deals, intramonth transactions 	will be confirmed using DECAF 2.  DECAF 1 will not be used.  	Global Facilities will not need to copied to a new pipeline code.  	The HPL DUN's number will remain the same.  	Deal entry will be manual for AEP risk system and getting old deals back into Sitara. 	The need to build a cross-reference table is the main driver.  New items  	A hands-on  training program is unlikely due to time  and space constrains. 	AEP/Enron evaluating options.  	New Risk Portfolios need to created in Sitara.  List provided to AEP. 	Enron giving explanations of portfolios for usefulness to AEP.  	Manual entries to G/L and reports needed to book all items.   All items on the Energy ops issues list were discussed.  AEP to fill in point person for there side.   Agreement reached to use this format and add items as needed.  I will issue a revised transitions issues list tomorrow afternoon, after my energy ops meeting.       
beck-s	 I agree.  I will coordinate with Kristin (for the Associates) and make it  happen. Once I have a date in mind I will let you know.

We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback from  the summer interns was favorable.

Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer?   It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  I will  be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the  following :  I will discuss with AA the following that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to  data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model  simplifications) that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses,  AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these  differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA  within the audit timetable) an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my  earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work ) The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards  ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to  meet the above stated objectives The signoff for additional permanent 'Enron' headcount who will 'duplicate'  certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing  Traffic staff A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the  final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to  investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or  system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility  ("OBSF") which commenced two weeks before the year end. The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility  late in the year end audit. The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code,  arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the  operational burden of supporting the OBSF. The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result  of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ). The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on  gardening leave. The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting  business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.  Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain  comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as  to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.  The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and  effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage  implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting  developers. The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as  to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1. Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process  tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all  Metals businesses. An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1  covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand  and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within  the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical  VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads. User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been  aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of  Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements  for the support of OBSF. A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control  staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit  timetable which incorporates  A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source  documentation within Enron Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party  inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will  not be received on a timely basis Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward  priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report  signed off by the traders ) Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation (  thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase )  and to AS400 Barclays account A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where  applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or  external documentation ( invoices/request for payment ) A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts  I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during  April   If you have any questions please call me on x34703  Regards  Mike

beck-s	 Please excuse the long e-mail below - I knew we'd never get a chance to all  get together, and this is somewhat urgent as I have to complete the Finance  Committee presentation for the upcoming BOD meeting by the end of next week,  and it will include trading results for the 1st quarter, reported in  accordance with the risk management policy.  Due to issues noted below, this  may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to  come up with the best quality numbers we can.  I talked to Beth already, and  MRM met with Chris Abel's group to see if there was a short cut, but our  joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved  in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the  best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the BOD.   We'll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3/30 #s as of end of the  day next Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.  As you recall, the February 12th BOD meeting resulted in a clarification that  the BOD approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups  defined, and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with  that limit structure (management reporting can be different of course).   Chris Abel's global energy operations group has prepared a "RAC" DPR that  attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk  management policy, so that top management and the BOD can see Enron's  exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis.    (A)  This DPR  will not impact actual sharing of P/L from a management reporting/business  unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and  reporting to the BOD.  But commercial management will need to review and sign  off on the RAC DPR and monitor limits accordingly, as these limits are at an  Enron level.  The specific trading results we need for the BOD presentation are the first  quarter P/L and average daily VaR, by commodity group.  The first RAC DPR  available is as of 3/30 - so while it has cumulative P/L, VaR is only as of   3/30.  (Note - we're also comparing to 1Q 2000, but we're not going to  attempt to resolve cross-commodity reporting for that period except at a high  level).  Your participation is needed in resolving: 1) cross-commodity reporting per  the new RAC DPR - both retroactively for the 1st quarter, and going forward,  and 2) ROVAR (return on average daily VaR by commodity group) for the 1st  quarter.  This aggregation of cross-commodity activity has been completed by  Chris as of 3/30, so he has what he believes to be P/L aggregated for the  quarter in accordance with the policy. What we don't have is VaR on a daily  basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on  3/30.  Obviously we're not going to be able to go back and calculate daily  VaR for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner -  especially within a week.  So it appears we'll need to "swag" average daily  VaR - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3/30, by  considering cross-commodity activity you're aware of that took place  throughout the quarter, and using our best estimate of the impact on VaR for  this cross commodity activity.    Due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices, we feel a certain  level of due diligence is required for us to  feel confident we're reporting  to the BOD in accordance with the policy. And since we only have a few days,  I thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt  resolution of material issues, and then you and Chris' group can work out  your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit.   When you consider materiality, please involve your Market Risk contact -  while a transaction/position/book may not be material to gas or power, it may  be material to Global Products,  Weather, etc..  Would you please help us with the following: ? Confirm your review of Chris' aggregation on the RAC DPR at 3/30 (Chris'  staff can walk you through) ? are all the cross-commodity positions you're aware of being reported  correctly? ? is there other cross-commodity activity not present at 3/30 and  consequently not aggregated for the quarter's results, but actually present  during the first quarter and material? If so, estimate impact on P/L and  average daily VaR. ? we're not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can  simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity  to get a feel, and if they point on specific material transactions, we can  address those; you can determine best approach ? are there certain books in RisktRAC that have cross-commodity positions  imbedded/combined - either held currently or those that generated significant  VaR or P/L during the quarter?  Going forward these will need to be reported  separately to facilitate risk reporting, but in the next week what we need is  an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities, or a conclusion  that the impact is immaterial. ? Once you've reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the RAC  DPR and per your own knowledge, help us estimate the impact on the respective  commodities' average daily VaR for the quarter - you can discuss with your  market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable "swag" approach.   After considering the information above, please provide your assessment on  whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross-commodity  activity, and if not, identify the issues involved and whether it is  something that market risk needs to address, or if it will simply take more  time to resolve the reporting details.  If you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading  results for the quarter, please feel free to pursue those.  I do not mean to  imply I know how to do your jobs, or that you're not doing them - I simply  want to coordinate with you to ensure the #s we report to the BOD are the  numbers you agree with, and that if they're not completely accurate given  recent implementation, that we are able to articulate and estimate the  potential misstatement, if any.  As you are the experts on your businesses'  results, I simply wanted to make sure I closed the loop with what we in MRM  understand regarding your reporting of the cross-commodity activity and  trading results and the application of the policy.  On a separate note, we need you to identify P/L related to special  transactions that flowed through the DPR, but do not really represent trading  activity - examples in the past are SFAS 125 transactions and other unique  gain/loss events - we're reporting 1Q 2001 and 1Q 2000, so whatever we can  recall about last year will also be considered. We will be sending you a  reconciliation from the DPR to the BOD package that we use to document any  special adjustments, and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement  on adjustments to the DPR reporting to derive true trading activity. These  adjustments should be minimal, but we'd like your input to conclude.     Thank you for your cooperation,  Regards, Cassandra Schultz x30429 713 858 2618 cell 936 321 2185 home   (A)  For example, North American Electricity limits represent Enron's  consolidated NA Electricity trading activity, without regard to which  business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds  positions. So if Power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons,  these gas trades need to be removed from Power VaR and P/L and combined with  Gas' VaR and P/L, etc..  Heating oil positions held outside Global Products  should be aggregated with Global Products; Global Products' positions in gas  and power should be aggregated with gas and power, with corresponding  adjustment to Global Products' results.

beck-s	 Hi Sally -  Taking care of Philippe's emails while he's out.  Are there one or two floors that are occupied fully by your groups?  Please tell me the floors (probably two) where you would like the meetings and I will call Patti to coordinate your availability to attend.  I'll then send an email to your people notifying them of such.

Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):    		29th Floor (trading)	67 employees		EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk   		30th Floor (trading)	35 employees		EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products)   		31st Floor (trading)	52  employees		Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR 										and MPR teams 		 		32nd Floor (trading)	117 employees		Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis  				  		37th Floor			148 employees		Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services 						 Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally  ---------------------- Forwarded by Sally Beck/HOU/ECT on 04/09/2001 10:30 AM ---------------------------     Office of the Chairman - Enron Net Works LLC   From:	Office of the Chairman - Enron Net Works LLC@ENRON on 04/09/2001 10:13 AM Sent by:	Enron Announcements@ENRON To:	ENW-Employees_Houston cc:	  Subject:	Net Works Floor Meetings - DATES AND LOCATIONS HAVE CHANGED PLEASE READ  We will be holding floor meetings on the following dates.

beck-s	 Heard from Allan Sommer today regarding the SAP licensing question:  ? We do not need to amend our current SAP license agreement for the  outsourcing project as long as we are the caretakers of the data, i.e.  outside entities do not  access data within our environment, but rather  access an extract of the data from it.  This should work well with the  current plan.  Allan further suggested that we keep Kathy Kokas from his group posted on our  effort, in case our plan changes.  He also mentioned that their group may be  helpful in other ways.  Thanks,  Fred Philipson

beck-s	 I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....  Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we  discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we  had found that were "show stoppers" as far as releasing the product for Beta  Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle  Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for  Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).    The team worked on the "fixes" and migrated the code last night.  Today  during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems  with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I  talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said  that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We  plan more testing in the morning.  They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to  introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos  for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to  postponed further.  We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were  comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need  consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.  Overall, we like the "new" streamlined version of the screens and feel that  it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.  Call with any questions.  Kim Theriot

I have also asked Kathryn to perform more testing within the CL team before  asking Kim and her team (or any other clients) to play with the changes.   Performing significant changes overnight, and then showing the code to  clients the next morning is wonderfully responsive, but a little too risky.

beck-s	 Evidently, we need to get Mike and James' consent to send someone over to London....  Clara was over there working on rate & currency which has nothing to do with London.  I am starting to hear more and more noise about James' attitude.  It is getting to the point (and possibly is already) that no one wants to work with him and it could isolate London operations even further from the mainstream.

beck-s	   Sally and Brian, Per my conversation with Brian regarding HPL books and records to be turned  over to AEP, we will complete the identification and inventory report of  records to be turned over by close of business Thursday, April 26, 2001.  We  will continue to track and monitor the location of these records during the  transition of personnel from Enron to AEP.  In order to ensure delivery of  the HPL/AEP Records Transfer List, we have increased the resources from three  to ten individuals.  Please call me if you need further clarification or have any comments or  concerns.  Thank you, Carolyn Gilley Ext. 35237 
beck-s	 Carol, thanks.  Anne:  we need to send this list to AEP to ensure they agree that this is the extent of our "Books and Records" obligations at Close.

beck-s	 So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last  week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.   Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we  can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.  Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that  participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra  participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy  immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant  called back and expressed their interest as well.  I will keep you posted on any further developments.

beck-s	 Tammy,   Attached is the spreadsheet I promised with those employees who are left to be placed on the 5th floor. I have excluded those Texas groups going to AEP and included the New Wellhead Logistics Group.     If for any reason this changes after Sally Beck has the opportunity to review it, I will advise you asap.    Also, I believe Sally may be interested in finding an office for Beth Apollo, VP close to her on the 5th floor.   Please call if you have any questions.    Thanks!  Heather Choate, x33278 
beck-s	 Fred   -- I think this looks good.  Frank and I briefly discussed yesterday.  Can you bring to the wider group on Monday to get their input.  Remember to encourage them not too be too detailed, as that will be hard to administrate, but hopefully they have some input on the commitments we have included.  Beth  PS can you schedule a meeting mid to late next week after Frank incorporates this info into the contract for the 3 of us to review?  I am out at a conference on Monday and Tuesday   -----Original Message----- From: 	Philipson, Fred   Sent:	Thursday, May 10, 2001 9:09 AM To:	Apollo, Beth; Sayre, Frank Subject:	SLA BO Services   << File: Services and Service Level Agreement.doc >>  Here's a copy of the latest draft of the service levels that we may expect to adhere to. We might also start to think about what would happen if we don't meet the performance levels indicated.  What do we offer up?  How will it be handled.  This could possible be addressed in a separate section.  See you later today,  Fred 5-9323 
beck-s	 We have some new hires that are not listed but I assume that HR will handle their transfers.  Also, Christina Bangle and Jay Blaine are leaving the group prior to the transfer date.  Otherwise the list is complete.

These transfers will be effective July 1, 2001 and I need to get this to HR by Friday, June 1, 2001 to give them time to get everything effected.  I think I have incorporated all your comments, but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn't have or excluded anyone.  You'll note that at this point we are not forming East and West risk management cost centers.  Don and Rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point.  Once you have signed off on your groupings, Rachel Massey in Corporate Planning will be working with each of you to forecast your Q3 and Q4 cost center expense plans.  Please let me know ASAP of any changes and don't hesitate to call with questions.  Thanks  Wade 
beck-s	  Please find the attached status/action items for the HPL Transactions.  We are currently on target for a 1 June Close.    
beck-s	 Attached is the final list of employees currently identified to be transferred to EWS and ENW from EES.  These transfers should be made effective July 1, 2001to effect a clean cut-off for accounting purposes.  I am sending these today to give you as much lead time as possible, but please do not make them effective any sooner.  Could each cost center lead please keep up with who is on their list today and, if employees are hired or terminated between now and July 1, 2001, make the appropriate adjustment with your respective HR representative to make sure they are transferred properly.  Rachel M., can you use this data to pull together a Q3 and Q4 plan for each cost center (working with the leads of each area).  Thanks  Wade
