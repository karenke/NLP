Darren,  The attached appears to be a nomination from Vastar Resources, Inc. for the  High Island Larger Block A-1 #2 (previously, erroneously referred to as the  #1 well).  Vastar now expects the well to commence production sometime  tomorrow.  I told Linda Harris that we'd get her a telephone number in Gas  Control so she can provide notification of the turn-on tomorrow.  Linda's  numbers, for the record, are 281.584.3359 voice and 713.312.1689 fax.  Would you please see that someone contacts Linda and advises her how to  submit future nominations via e-mail, fax or voice?  Thanks.

farmer-d	 Jackie,  Since the inlet to 3 River Plant is shut in on 10/19/99 (the last day of  flow): at what meter is the McMullen gas being diverted to? at what meter is HPL buying the residue gas?

Please advice.   We need to resolve this as soon as possible so Settlement  can send out payments.  Thanks

farmer-d	 There are two fields of gas that I am having difficulty with in the Unify  System.  1. Cage Ranch - Since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this  gas on King Ranch, it is my understanding  HPL is selling the liquids and  King Ranch is re-delivering to stratton.  It is also my understanding that  there is a .05 cent fee  to deliver this gas.  We need a method to accomodate the volume flow on HPL  at meter 415 and 9643.  This gas   will not be reflected on Trans. Usage ticket #123395 and #95394 since it is  not being nominated from a   processing agreement.  We either, need to input  a point nom (on HPL or KRGP) at these meters to match the nom at meter  9610,  or a deal for Purchase and Sale (if King Ranch is taking title to the gas)  needs to be input into Sitara at these meters  with the  appropriate rate.  I  have currently input a point nom on KRGP to accomodate this flow, so we can   divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made.  2. Forest Oil -   There is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow  from the meter (6396) into King Ranch.  It is my  understanding that this agreement was originally setup until Texaco had  their own processing agreement.  I need   confirmation that the gas from this  meter should be nominated on contract # (96006681) and that this agreement  should  have been reassigned to HPLC. (It is currently still under HPLR).     If this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement, then once  again we need to accomodate the flow volume  on the HPL pipe with either a  point nom or a Sitara Deal at meters 415 and 9643. 
farmer-d	 Thanks so much for the memo.  I would like to reiterate my support on two key  issues:  1).  Thu - Best of luck on this new assignment.  Howard has worked hard and  done a great job!  Please don't be shy on asking questions.  Entex is  critical to the Texas business, and it is critical to our team that we are  timely and accurate.  2).  Rita:  Thanks for setting up the account team.  Communication is  critical to our success, and I encourage you all to keep each other informed  at all times.  The P&L impact to our business can be significant.   Additionally, this is high profile, so we want to assure top quality.  Thanks to all of you for all of your efforts.  Let me know if there is  anything I can do to help provide any additional support.

Howard  and Thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the  account over the next few months.  Entex will be Thu's primary account  especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations  process and the contracts.   Howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be  available for questions or as a backup, if necessary (thanks Howard for all  your hard work on the account this year!).     In the initial phases of this transistion, I would like to organize an Entex  "account" team.  The team (members from front office to back office) would  meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the  scheduling, allocations, settlements, contracts, deals, etc.  This hopefully  will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before  the finalization process, but to learn from each other relative to your  respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as  well.  I would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as I  believe this is a critical part to the success of the Entex account.    I will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1/2000.   If anyone has any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me or stop  by.  Thanks in advance for everyone's cooperation...........   Julie - Please add Thu to the confirmations distributions list

farmer-d	 I'm sorry, did we discuss BMC???.  Lee can confirm the accuracy of this, but BMC bought 20,000 from us and  intended no swing and no buyback. Brandywine (Dorcheus) controlled the meter,  therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders. I  believe a deal is in place with Brandywine to cover that very issue for  November. If not please let me know.  Lee, if this is not your understanding for Nov. business please let us all  know.  Thanks  Ken       Howard B Camp 12/20/99 07:36 PM To: Lee L Papayoti/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Thu Nguyen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenneth Seaman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Howard B  Camp/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kristen J Hanson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stella L Morris/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Meter 1428 Oct 99 - Beaumont Methanol  Lee,  I need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue.  First, you show a deal volume of 20,000  on Nov. 7 and the pipeline confirmed  this volume.  Is this the volume you agreed to sell Beaumont Methanol?  This  volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says, the volume confirmed by  HPL, and Dorcheus's volume.    Second, the buyback issue is that  a buyback is set up until June 2000 per  Julie Meyers notes she sends out every month ( Last note sent Dec  3 and you  are on distribution list) .  Brandywine has nothing to do with this issue. It  is an issue between HPL and Beaumont Methanol.  Do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the  buyback?

If not, please notify Julie and note on the  deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective. If it is still active, please contact Chyral and resolve.  Let me know the final resolution.

farmer-d	 Hey Joe,  Here's the response I got with regards to Tomcat. I've place another call  into David and let him know that the information we received included most  points except for Tomcat. I'll keep you informed.   What I know is that the gas is sourced at MI 587 and moved on KM's firm  contract. For as long as CES remembers, they sell the gas to Entex. Entex  chooses the pipe off which they take--usually Midcon--also, HPL Channel, or  Tejas. KM is invoiced directly. Volume is approx. 2395. The deal with Entex  is written up monthly. KM pays on a basket of indices. Entex pays on the  highest index.

Questions     Questions:  1.  At Agua Dulce, which pipe can the GP plant go into? Can it go into HPL?  2. Do you have nom forms for any plant nominations we may need?  3. For GEMC, is the Tejas plant at Thompsonville? Do you know how any of  those points tie into HPL?  4. Do you have avails for MOPS production? The gas that is transported to  Tivoli--what contract do you use?  5. For Kerr McGee, do you have the Entex contacts you speak with?  6. Is there a Waskom nom form? With whom do you speak over there?  7. For the avails sheet you sent, the first row of column titles is blacked  out. Can you tell me what the row reads?  8. What volumes will come from Koch Gathering into Carthage for next month?  We show conflicting numbers.  Thanks, Ami 713/853-9272    Here goes ...  1.  I know Tennessee, HPL, and Tejas are at the tailgate of the plant, and I suspect Midcon Texas is there as well.  2.  I'll fax you a copy of the nomination form that Steve Locke uses for Agua Dulce and Carthage ... those are the only ones in Texas that we nominate.  3.  The Tejas Plant as well as all of the other Gulf Energy receipt points  from PennzEnergy are exclusively Tejas/Gulf Energy points, and it takes transport charges to move the gas through Gulf Energy to interconnects, such as Thompsonville.  The Jennings Plant does have a split connect with Delhi, but operationally PennzEnergy much prefers to flow into Gulf Energy (lower  pressure = higher volumes).  4.  Mustang Island 759 for January is again 1,903 mmbtu/d, which Peoples will pick up at the wellhead.  Mustang Island 785 is 4,100/d, which leaves 2,200/d available to sell assuming we continue to transport 1,895/d to FGT/Tivoli for Peoples.  Our IT agreement on NNG is #78581 to move gas from the wellhead to onshore.  5.  The Tomcat gas has been sold to Entex into Midcon Texas for so long that I don't think Maria even talks to them anymore each month.  Tammi provides them with the volume when she does the deal each month.  But we can certainly provide an Entex contact if the gas is sold to them again in January.  6.  There isn't a Waskom nomination form.  The trader for this gas, Mike Landolt, talks to Ben Britten (President of New Waskom Gas Gathering and  Waskom Gas Marketing).  7.  You must be referring to the page of offshore avails that begins with Sabine Pass 13.  The 6 columns that appear blacked out read as follows:  PVR, PVR, Avail, DBQ, DBQ, and Remainder.  8.  The Koch-gathered volumes behind the Carthage Plant for 1/00 are 12,443 mmbtu/d.

At Carthage, the deliveries to Koch? What is that 15000 on your  whiteboard for. Who is it to? Are the volumes termed up?  2.  At Midcon Texas, you usually sell all the supply to its marketing  affiliate, correct? Is so, is that gas termed up or do you sell it month to  month?  3. Is the gas to Entex off Tomcat sold as base or swing? Don't they change  the volume occasionally?Has Anadarko given you any avails for Jan?     Round 2:  1.  The 15,000 @ Carthage for Koch is an estimate of what we anticipate we  will want to sell into Koch ... and it shows up on the Koch whiteboard as a supply (from Carthage).  During bidweek the traders will decide how much they  actually want to show going to Koch, and how much will be labeled base and swing.  Mike Landolt has been our sole Koch trader and he typically takes some Carthage gas into Koch, but I wouldn't say a particular volume is termed-up.  2.  Other than very rarely shippling the Jennings Ranch volume over to NGPL, we've always sold all of the Midcon Texas volumes to the affiliate ... currently done one month at a time.  John Hymel has been the trader for these volumes.  3.  The Entex sale @ Tomcat has always been Gas Daily because that is the way Kerr-McGee prices the supply ... and Entex has taken all the swings.  The January volume is 2,312/d.  David  p.s.  I still don't know my schedule for Wednesday ... everyone who is being asked to work Transition is meeting individually with management on Wednesday and the schedules haven't been provided yet.

farmer-d	 From this mornings morning meeting, it is my understanding that the gas from  McMullen into Humble (then King Ranch) will ve lowered due to line pigging  for the next few days.  Please keep in mind that there are interstate sales  out of King Ranch.  You may want to notify the traders that there will not be  as much supply in King Ranch to meet these sales.  I have estimates for the sales and supply for the 27th.  Total Interstate sales out of the King Ranch Gas Plant = 26,422 MMBtu  Total Supply (less PVR) =       Cage Ranch  = 37,600 Forest Oil  =  3,696 LaEncantada  =     767 Big Cowboy  = 34,697 Three Rivers(Current) = 18690   Total Supply For Sale on 27th.    = 95,450 MMBtu  These supply volumes are based on the Supply Deals in the Unify system.  If  there are variances operationally, then the Sitara Supply Deals should be  lowered appropriately. 
farmer-d	 Howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in Volume  Management's initials in OSS.  I need some information for Daren before it  can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for  11/97 forward.  I've done some research as follows:  1/95 shows delivery on transport contract #012-82269-02-002 (Southeastern  Marketing Co. as counterparty)  1/96 thru 10/31/97 shows delivery on transport contract #012-27182-02-001  (Esperanza Marketing Corp as counterparty).  11/97 thru 12/97 shows delivery on 089-41500-102  1/98 shows delivery on  089-41500-101  No other transactions at this meter since 1/98.  Some questions I need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport  contracts through 10/31/97 and then started to be allocated to the 089  contract later?  Are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to  and is that the reason the 089 contract was used?   Or should the transport  contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11/97 forward?  Each  item indicates a delivered volume, so either a transport  or sale is taking  place.    All the information that is supplied on the UA4 report is need a contract for  9,448 MMBTU.  Since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it  was assigned to me, it's difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used  for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in  CPR or OSS.

I have a  new meter for C&E Operating, meter # 0989813 that started up Nov.29.  I have  a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29th and 30th, a  total of 660mmbtu.  The problem is there is nothing in the system for meter #  9813 for 11/99 production.  I looked in Sitara,( sitara # 132030 ) and the  deal  starts for 12/99 production.   I checked with Donald to make sure and  he says that the meter did start up 11/29 and the price is HSC less $.10.  In  order to get this deal into the system, who do I need to talk to???  Thanks,  Stephanie ( 3-6004 )       
farmer-d	 Beginning this week, we are actively testing the changes to Path Manager to  receive real-time deal updates from Sitara.  To prepare for this, we would  like to have a limited group of schedulers from each desk go thru a quick  walkthru/training of the new features sometime early next week.  This should  only take about 30 minutes.  Once they are comfortable with the features and  performance, and once the testing is complete, we would like to migrate this  to Unify Production either next week or the week after.  This should give us  an adequate adjustment period prior to the next bid week.  Once it is migrated to Production, we can either roll it out to all  schedulers or to selected schedulers via security.  Heather, could you please schedule some time with the designated schedulers,  Scotty, and myself early next week.  A room with a projector would work best.  Thanks, d.n.

I have a couple of issues  I want ot clear up for this year's contract.  The question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you  are currently pulling gas.  Our new contract that was just sent to you has a  minimum take of 60,000 mmbtu (estimated 35,000 @ 8018 Celanese, 15,000 @ 1233  Texas City, and 10,000 @ 1394 Dodge Street).  If you undertake at any meter  excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60,000  mmbtu.  My accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the  two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out.  We discussed  this on the phone and I got your consent to split these invoices.  Now we are  being told all three invoices need to be separate.  Since we always aim to  please the customer, here is my recommendation for handling the contract  through it's term.  Please let me know if this is fine.  Celanese 35,000 mmbtu/d minimum  On any given day if volumes fall below  35,000 HPLC will buy back these volumes at GD Katy mid       two days after flow  Texas City 15,000 mmbtu/d minimum On any given day if volumes fall below  15,000 HPLC will buy back these volumes at GD Katy mid       two days after flow  Dodge Street 10,000 mmbtu/d minimum On any given day if volumes fall below  10,000 HPLC will buy back these volumes at GD Katy mid       two days after flow  Any excess volumes taken at all three locations would be billed @ GD HSC High  2 day after  
farmer-d	 Each meter is now to be treated seperately: Tickets have been created  accordingly.  Meter 1233  Base  148376 Swing  148382 Buyback 148381   Meter 1394  Base  148390 Swing  148391 Buyback 148396  Meter 8018  Base   148376 Swing  148382 Buyback 148381  Volume Management will need to set up accounting arrangements to cover  November and December 1999. Scheduling will repath and renom Unify, and  reallocate POPS for January.  If anyone has anything to add to this please let me know.  Ken

farmer-d	 Darren,  we had a situation in December that we need your help to resolve.  Deal #125836 We have been purchasing gas from Cox Exploration on PG&E  Hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility.  This purchase  agreement terminated 11/30/99.  I didn't path the gas on PGEH, however, I  will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at  Thompsonville.  I didn't catch this and the Deal on the HPL side appeared to  be a valid flow issue for Kim Vaughn.  The plant continued to confirm this  gas.  We have tried working through the pipeline, but they state that they will not  know anything until the 15th.  Can you contact the producer and ask them to  reverify this with the pipeline?  I would like Kim to be able to zero confirm  and send back to Pops so Volume Management will not allocate up to the  producer level.  Also I just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at  the same meter with Tribo Production.  Should there have been an expected  volume in this Deal?  Is it possible that Cox exploration sold their interest  in this well to Tribo.  It may turn out that we should have flowed the gas  after all.

It is available for any month. The reports that I regularly used were for helping to clean up current month activity, which would not be of any use to you.

I  checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate  of 7,394 MMBTu.    Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked  OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does  seem strange that this is the only month of flow.  Thanks, Stella      
farmer-d	 A walk-thru/demo of this new functionality was held today with the Logistics  Managers and representative schedulers from each region except for Texas and  Calgary.  The changes were well received and no revisions were requested.   They would like to have the changes migrated to Production the evening of  Tuesday, January 18 for use the morning of Wednesday, January 19.  Paul, could you please insure that the network folks have the Tibco install  complete by Monday, including Terminal Server. Scotty, Paul may need one of your folks to insure that the Tibco install  works OK on Terminal Server (none of us have access). Scotty, can you follow up with Calgary and Texas since they missed the demo.  Also, what level of security is desired for the rollout - selected  schedulers or all of Logistics? Dave M, plan to have the last few related items in Stage by Monday to insure  all is clean by Tuesday night. (print, filter, closed Path List, & app close  error msg)  If you do not feel like this schedule can be met, please let me know as you  become aware.  Thanks, d.n.

All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left  unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed  appropriately.  Someone   needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero,  that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.   2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.

farmer-d	 Hi Daren, I spoke with Ricky Archer at Calpine about some penalty charges I billed him  for undertakes on Dec 20, 21, 31. He said force majeure letters were sent to your attention.  If you have them, would you have someone fax a copy of those letters to met  at 713-646-8420?  Do you have any other information on the force majure or should I speak with  Jennifer?  Thanks for your help! 
farmer-d	 I'm sitting here a bit disappointed and pissed.  Do you and Pat honestly believe it is "one man's word against another" on  setting up the link builder by the 12th of the month?  If so, why have I been saying something is wrong with some of the links for  the last several days? And why did I work so late the first couple of days of  each month setting up the links when I had so much time?  I'm not going to play this game with Mr. Lloyd. When he took the time to show  up he was coached well in what was needed to be done, how to do it, and when  to do it.  This situation was entirely predictable. It is always "I'm about to do it"  and it is always an "I thought you said............." situation.  You know better. I won't be hung out again.    - att1.htm 
farmer-d	 Attached are two spreadsheets showing Entex data for Dec. 99.  Jan00_factor shows the difference between the estimates that should have fed  over to POPs and the actual for all meters in the meter set {2001-2500, 2540,  3509, 3519, 3530, 3533, 6822, 9544}.  I do not have the actual for Vidor CG  yet.  I have estimated the volume to be 190.00.  Actuals were 6105.26 Mmcf using the Vidor CG estimate Estimates were 4870.37 Mmcf.  Difference of 1237.89 Mmcf.    Jan00_scada shows that if we had correct information from the Hempstead CG  RTU the difference would have been 819.186 Mmcf.    If you have any questions please call.    Gary 
farmer-d	 Daren.  In the past, this meter was brokered and I didn't see the nom..  This  month, there are two contracts -----  ENA 201 for 4149 vol. and HPL 215 for  4000 vol.  the net at the meter being 149.   This does show up on my meter  exception report.  Please advise.  Thank you.

farmer-d	 I received a call from Shannon last Wednesday (1/12), requesting what our  needs might be for new analysts who will be starting in 2/00.  Shannon and I  have talked specifics, but if you have an interest, please call Shannon ASAP  @ x33853 to discuss the specifics.  It has been some time since we have put a new analyst into Logistics - Texas,  but the other groups have taken new ones in the past.  I'm just asking you to  think about it, and let me and Shannon know.  Thanks.   Shannon:  I do have an analyst rotating 6/1 from the Texas Risk team.  I  might be interested in putting another one into the group, and it's not a bad  idea to start now with training.  Can you let me know who you still need to  place???  I would like to look at their resumes and talk with someone who  interviewed them.  Thanks. 
farmer-d	 Attached is a file with my allocations of Texas Operations to be used for the  2000 Plan.  However, please note that their are some problems/clean-up that  needs to occur that I could not do.  As you requested, I have taken the % we allocated to Gas Assets last year and  put the appropriate %'s into the appropriate group within Gas Assets as you  have broken them out.  Please note:  Gas Network Trading is the same group as  ST GasTexas (group 8) - Tom Martin is responsible for both.  I have indicated  the appropriate %'s into the NEW buckets, but I was not able to ZERO out the  ST GasTexas group as the cells are protected.  Consequently, the TOTAL column  indicates that I have allocated over 100%.  The #'s in Gas Network Trading  are correct.  Will you please delete ST GasTexas so that no one will allocate  to it? When the plan allocations were submitted last year, there was an error in  RC1160 - Volume Management.  I thought we corrected it but it is still  showing up incorrectly.  Please move the 8% under East Origin to ST GasEast.   I was not able to correct this either as the cells have been protected.   Please note:  This is not a change from the plan, but a correction of an  error.   I would appreciate you correcting these things for me, and forwarding the  corrected version back to me for my records.  I will be working with our  management team on the 1/00 allocations, and will provide you those by  Friday.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.   MANAGEMENT TEAM:  Please review, and work on how we should be allocated for  1/00.  We have changes for Denver business, Project Sally, NewCo, etc.  We  will discuss in the staff meeting on Tuesday, 1/18.

Duke and Devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance, which according to Devon was approximately 240,000 due to Duke at 8/31/99.  Devon acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn't think it was that high.   Both parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them wrong.  According to Duke the imbalance grew by 120,000 in September, 16,000  in October, and another 12,000 in November (all round numbers) bringing the total to approximately 395,000 through the end of November.  Based on current month estimates, Duke thinks January sales are 1,000-2,000/day higher than production, and would like to see a cut in sales of 4,000/day effective Friday 1/21/00 in order to balance for the month of January.  Again Devon disagrees with this daily overage, based on their production estimates, but since they recognize an imbalance exists,  Willie @ Devon has agreed to reduce the volume available for sale by 4,000/day effective Friday the 21st.  This will reduce the amount of "excess" gas (gas daily-priced) that Enron has available to sell at Carthage. Additionally, beginning February 1st Duke requests payback to the plant of 5,000/day, continuing until the imbalance is worked off.  Devon should reduce their 1st of the month availabe volume by 5,000/d to accomplish this, and  Enron needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are setting up February activity. A key point to this imbalance issue, and one that I believe all of the parties agree on, is that CES, now Enron, purchases Devon's Carthage gas at the tailgate of the plant, so any production-related imbalance is between Devon  and the plant (Duke) and make-up volumes only reduce what Enron receives from Devon.  Enron is not buying the gas from Devon and turning around and paying back a historical imbalance.  However, since CES (and now Enron) is set up as Devon's agent at Carthage, Duke communicates the imbalance information and coordinates make-up arrangements with Enron.  Enron in turn needs to verify with Devon that Devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any make-up.  Hopefully once actual make-up commences, Devon and Duke will strive to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on. Please call me if you have any questions @ (713) 693-2581.  David

The transport delivery off HPLC was  shorted to keep Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport  imbalance was to be cleared the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of  1999, but 91,297 MMBtu still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC  Index for the upcoming months so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can  clear this imbalance. We will need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the  purchase from ENA by 91,297  MMBtu for that month.  I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant  Energy - Entex allocation to  make sure this happens.   Thanks, Michael 
farmer-d	 I've given up on the spreadsheet - I couldn't insert the column.  So this is  my allocation.  Would you please update the spreadsheet for these changes and  send me a clean copy?  I want o distribute to my management team for their  records.  Thanks.  
farmer-d	 Please plan to attend a meeting Tuesday the 25th from 4 - 5 pm reviewing the  Texas Budgets.  You will receive hard copies of the budgets tomorrow. Please  review them and hold ALL questions and concerns until the meeting.  If at all  possible please forward your questions to me so that I may compile a list to  be delivered to Lisa Cousino Tuesday morning.  Thank you! Yvette x3.5953 
farmer-d	 Please read Brian's memo below.  We spoke briefly about this yesterday in the  staff meeting.  I have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where I  have provide the 2000 Plan allocations.  Please note that we were not making  changes to the Plan, only breaking the Gas Asset group into smaller buckets.   Any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are NOT  reflected on the allocation sheet.  Rather they ARE reflected on the 1/00  allocations, and they will require explanations each month as all variances  from Plan do.  This includes new RC's which have set up, etc.  I need each of you to review the 2000 Plan allocations as I submitted them  earlier today, and provide an accurate allocation of your RC for 1/00.  What  has your group spent their time on in 1/00???  Please be aware that we could  receive questions from the Commercial teams, so document your logic.  Some  things to consider:  Project Sally - allocate to Gas Network Development Project Hurricane - allocate to ???? - (I have a call into Jim Coffey) Denver Business - allocate to Rocky Mountain Asset Originations  If you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them,  either call me, Jackie Nelson or Jim Coffey.  One other thing to note:  The Network Trading group will be further broken  down into 2 groups:  Trading (Tom Martin and Jim Schwieger) and  Transportation (Ed Gottlob).  Although the attached worksheet does not  include this breakdown, please include it in yours.  I would like you allocations back to me no later than Thursday, 1/20 @  3:00pm.  Thanks.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT on 01/19/2000  05:36 PM ---------------------------   Brian Heinrich 01/14/2000 05:07 PM To: Robert Superty/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan  Harrison/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Pleus/HOU/ECT@ECT, D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephen P Schwarz/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lisa B Cousino/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: 2000 Plan Allocations and January Allocations  The attached  files contain the Allocation Percentages for 2000 plan, January  2000 Actuals and a description of the new Assets Teams.    Please update the 2000 plan file to reflect the following changes to the  Assets Team.  The Assets Team is now broken out into the following "groups"  which are described in the attached Word Document:  RC#  Team Name    RC Owner    The 2000 plan file now has columns for the above teams, please take the  percentage that was previously allocatated to Assets (which is in the  Executive column) and reallocate it among all of the teams except Rocky  Mountain Asset Originations that you support.  I have already inserted the  new percentages to be used for Rocky Mountain, which are based on a portion  of the Upstream Origination Allocation that was determined by the Assets  group.  Consequently I have changed the allocation percentage for Upstream  Origination.  I have also protected all of the cells except the ones you need  to change to avoid confusion.  I also need you to update the percentages to be used for January 2000  actuals.  I have added the new RC's that we have set up since plan has been  complete, so please make sure you have each RC 100% allocated.  I will need the updated plan percentages returned to me by noon Wednesday  January 19th, and the updated January 2000 percentages returned to me by end  of day Friday January 21st.    Thanks for your help in getting these updated. Brian

farmer-d	 FYI. ---------------------- Forwarded by Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT on 01/20/2000  02:48 PM ---------------------------                             	 	Enron Technology 	 	From:  Tommy J Yanowski                           01/20/2000 12:22 PM 	  To: John Tollefsen, Arshak Sarkissian, Keith Dziadek/HOU/EES@EES, Scott  Mills, Stephen Schwarz, Michael Eiben/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brenda Herod, Inja Chun,  Dave Nommensen, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scotty Gilbert, Jim  Fussell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Venturatos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Connie Sutton/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Donna Consemiu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Antoine V Pierre/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Solmonson,  Susan Harrison/HOU/ECT@ECT, Edward de  Valcourt/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jim Coffey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie  Ferrara/HOU/ECT@ECT, Romeo D'Souza/HOU/ECT@ECT, <fielddr@texaco.com>,  Wrighcs@texaco.com, Robert D Morgan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wanda Curry, James  McKay/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Harold Bertram/HOU/ECT@ECT, Philippe Bibi, Beth Perlman, Robert  Shiring/HOU/ECT@ECT, Shonnie Daniel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck  Subject: Project Hurricane/Bridgeline Status  Here is a quick status and list of to do's related to setting up the new J.V.  between Enron & Texaco which will be combining the LRC and Bridgeline  pipeline systems:  Summary:  The LRC & Bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the  name of Bridgeline LLC.  Ownership in the JV will be split 60% Texaco & 40%  Enron.  Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC will be the entity that will be trading  on the pipelines under the new J.V.  Contracts and Service  Agreements are in  the process of being drafted.    Enron will be providing the Trading and Commercial Operations systems to  support this J.V.  Texaco will be providing the Scada system.  I understand  that Accounting is still being discussed.  The Trading, Risk, & perhaps  Scheduling personnel for this JV will be initially relocated to the 21st  floor of the Enron Building and will eventually move to probably the 3 Allen  Center once a more permanent spot can be built out.  Trading for the new JV  will start in early February for March Production.  To Do's:  Accounting:  I've asked Jim Coffey to set up two work orders to capture IT  transition and ongoing costs.  Texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next  Monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same  page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks.  PC's:  Jim Fussell is in the process of ordering the PC's for this JV at my  request.  I will need the work order numbers to track these costs.  Networks:  I'm coordinating with Arshak and his team to make sure that the  voice and data networks are in place for EB 21.  Once the more permanent spot  is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location.   A  combination of Trader phones, Lucent Phones, Stenfons and Amtels have been  requested.  Location on EB 21:  I'm waiting on a call back from Chris Larson from  facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new JV.   Currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall  cubes.  There may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall  cubes.  We can't set up the PC's, phones, Amtels, etc until this is done.  Data Conversion:  I have requested from Texaco the contract, deal and  meter/facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin  trading for March production.  It may be possible to get an electronic dump  of this data from Texaco if Enron defines the data fields that we will need.   We also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios.  I will also need  to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the  system security.  I have received the names of the traders but I don't know  who else will need access.  Interface between Enron's Unify POP's application and Bridgeline's Scada  application:  I've asked Dave Nommensen from Enron to get with Carryn Wright  from Texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two  applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface.   There will also need to be a transition plan put in place where LRC's  RTU's/EFM is redirected to the Bridgeline Scada system.  In the meantime  there will be two Scada systems and perhaps two Gas Controls until everything  is merged into one.  This will probably mean some manual interfaces between  POP's and Scada for Confirmed noms and EFM volumes until the transition is  complete.  Scada Communications:  Currently the LRC RTU's/EFM communicate back to  Enron's Scada system via leased lines.  Bridgelines RTU's communicate back to  them via a microwave system.  The new JV could save on communications costs  by switching LRC's RTU communication to the microwave.  Perhaps this is best  done as a part of the Scada transition.  Accounting data needed by Texaco for Royalty purposes:  This data needs to be  better defined.  I will follow up with John LeDoux from Texaco to get this  process started.  Hourly volumes:  Bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be  billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing.  We need to talk  through this process to see what enhancements may be needed.  At least  initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the  billing for this one customer.  Please let me know if you'd like to meet on any of these topics.  I can have  my assistant set up the meeting if needed.  In the mean time I can be reached  at 713-853-6858.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

farmer-d	 My contact at Beaumont Methanol asked me to tell everybody in our shop the  following:  to clarify whom to contact about the nomination and scheduling  for Beaumont Methanol at meter # 1428.  First some background:  we feed Beaumont Methanol through a meter station  that we own and control, but which also feeds Brandywine/DuPont.  In fact,  the gas goes through a DuPont pipeline header downstream of our meter station  before it gets to Beamont Methanol.  Sometimes we are doing business with  both Beaumont Methanol and Brandywine/DuPont ..... but sometime we only do  business with one of them.  WHOM TO CALL FOR ANY NOMINATIONS AND SCHEDULING ISSUES FOR BEAUMONT METHANOL:  Bob Dorcheus - Brandywine/DuPont - 281-293-1789 Chyral Hankins - Beaumont Methanol (Terra) - 712-233-6558  PLEASE DO NOT CALL THE BEAUMONT METHANOL CONTROL ROOM AT THE PLANT WITH  REGARD TO SCHEDULING AND NOMINATION ISSUES.   THEY ARE OUT OF THE LOOP ON  THESE ISSUES.  If we call the Beaumont Methanol control room at the plant  with regard to scheduling and nominations issues, it will cause confusion of  the type we had yesterday and today.  Obviously, it is of course OK for HPL Gas Control to call the Beaumont  Methanol plant control room on any emergency operational issues.  Thanks ... and have a great weekend.  Lee

farmer-d	 Assuming the test results are good, the move from the CES desks to the  appropriate ENA desks will take place either Wednesday or Thursday evening:   CES - IM East   to ENA - IM East  CES - IM Central  ENA - IM Central  CES - IM Texas   ENA - IM Texas  This move will be done systematically for January forward business.  After  this move is complete, there should be no active deals remaining on the CES  desks.  The following is a list of deals that I wanted to bring to your  attention and review.  One of the base assumptions expressed by all was that  there were no transport usage tickets booked on the CES desk.  This is not  true; however transport usage tickets will be included in the change over;  therefore this will not be a problem.  On the East desk, three desk to desk  deals will not be able to be converted (see below).  Once all CES deals have  been changed to the East desk, I would imagine that these three desk to desk  deals need to be killed.  Please advise if there are any questions regarding the desk move.  If any  desk prefers to leave January as is and have deals moved February forward,  manual deal entry will be involved (ending the deals as of 01/31/99 on the  CES desk and creating a new deal on the appropriate physical desk).

farmer-d	 FYI .... for Feb00 only, Equistar asked we deliver the gas under Sitara  106736 to HPL meter 1373 instead (the plant it was originally going to is  having some maintenance being done in Feb).  While I've already change the delivery point in the Sitara ticket, maybe  something needs to bve done to the risk assignment .....

farmer-d	 Deals 141877,141883, and 141884 (Koch Midstream) were in CES's system (and  ours) as term sales. However,  those deals were terminated by CES. So, any  volumes at KMID are sold to Midcon Texas P/L Operator at IF-.09. The purchase  price is (.10) for base volumes and (.11) for swing volumes. For Feb, I  zeroed the volumes in deals 141877,141833,141884, in Sitara. All of the  volumes will be in deal 156256. O'Neal, do we need to risk assign this new  deal? Julie, it is an evergreen deal.  MTPL takes whatever is produced at the  points. Let me know if I can help with anything else.  Thanks, AC

farmer-d	 Just following up to my week ago note.  Rest assured I know how hectic things have been around here and how many  irons you have in your fire. Time for my issues are, I'm sure, a lower  priority.  Let me offer a thought or two.  I don't have enough challenges at the moment to hold my interest.    I had asked for next Wed and Thurs. off. Let's toss in Fri also. My  expectation is you would have a plan by the time I would come back, Monday  the 7th. I hate to be a pest but you need to get a better value for the  paltry salary $'s you are paying me. Maybe a Tues-Thurs. week would work  better for each of us. Or if things are going the way they seem to be;  you  don't need me at all.  If  you could possibly let me know before the 7th what the plan is I sure  would appreciate it.     Thanks,  Ken  P.S. Just in case the plug is pulled on this --- please-- no formal goodbys.  I will pay my respects to those I want too. I would very much like to just  fadeout -- ok?

farmer-d	 When you get allocations for January, we need to look at daily volumes for  Transaction #1. Towards the end of the month, Entex was approaching its Jan  winter cap volume of 550,000/day. If the daily volume for Trans #1 comes out  greater than 550, the excess must be charged at GD+10. The numbers thus far  show that they did not exceed 550. However, the allocated volumes tend to  differ.   Thanks, AC

For desk to desk deals, we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not  a Co 16 contract with Co 16 and attaching an ECT transport contract to the  backscreen.  On Park and ride deals, I am under the impression that the Park and ride deal  would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a  subsequent month. If this is true, was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous Co  89 entry.  I am not sure whether an ECT transport should be attached.  I hope  you have some insight on this issue.

farmer-d	 Due to low volumes flowing from Fuels Cotton Valley, we nominate 32,000 MMBtu/d at the HPL/Eastrans interconnect for the referenced period.  We are estimating that will redeliver 7,000  MMBtu/d from Fuels Cotton Valley and 25,000 MMBtu/d into PG & E.  I talked to Darren and Brian on the ability to swing additional volume to PG  & E during a day, and they said PG & E won't accept daily changes at all !!!  So, if that is the case, we will have to find an alternate method to swing the volume.  Based on our agreement, we have the ability to give them volume into other pipelines at the hub.   Maybe we can swing on them.  In the short term, however, we are going to have to make  due with adjusting the HPL volume to equal redelivered volume as best we can.  Sorry for the lateness of this email.  I will get daily nom changes into you earlier next week. Thanks for working with us.

farmer-d	 Hi Daren,  I enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning. You have very high standards for your own performance and are highly committed to the best outcome in all situations. You are likely to have high expectations for results from our coaching meetings This a good formula for success and I will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving the action forward.  With this in mind, I had some thoughts and additional questions for reflection following the meeting that I would like to share.  You are in a transition from being a  high team performer to becoming the leader of a high performing team.  One of your frustrations as leader is that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems that arise in the day to day operations of the team.  At first you responded to their requests for help by solving it for them, then you shifted to using questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with  you.  You have also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more independent problem solvers.  You are frustrated when some members of the team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use.  You are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability that they come to you for.  You have recruited people with this ability and you seek to expand it in the team.  This issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our next meeting.  The question is: How to engage the team in solving this problem.  How do I get the members of this team to own this responsibility and begin creating their own solutions?  What resources are needed by each person to contribute more to this problem? How do I involve the team members more in the solving of this problem? What new behaviors do I need to employ to increase the involvement of the team?  What do I need to change in myself or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in the problem?  There is one dimension that I am clear about. I know that you have used performance appraisals to give feedback.  Have you put this issue before the team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual team members?  I look forward to our meeting on the 17th.  Keep growing!  Mike TEAMLeadership Center  Mobile:  713-598-6732 Office:  713-871-8326 Fax:  713-871-1707 Home: 409-321-0680 mam@teamlead.com

These  meters are where Mid-Texas interconnects with PG & E's system, and there should not be any measurement taking place on HPL.

Under  Aggregate 7012 is 4045;  6026; 6114; 6427; 6848; 9755 ;  these should all be  under the 987341.  Do we need to renominate these meters or do I just move  them in pops.

In order to actualize JAN POPS has to manually load the actual files into POPS, the  side effect of this is that some of the FEB data may be loaded with numbers that are old. This will be rectified as we complete loading the JAN actuals and then load the most recent MIPS measured prelim numbers for FEB.  POPS is currently processing the MIPS files in the order they were received, we should be done with this today. Please inform us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow.  thanks Romeo

farmer-d	 RED-NECK VALENTINE'S LOVE POEM  Collards is green my dog's name is Blue and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you.  Yore hair is like cornsilk a-flapping in the breeze Softer than  OLD Blue's and without all them fleas.  You move like the bass, which excite me in May. You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway.  Yo're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. Yo're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can.  You have som'a yore teeth, for which I am proud; I hold my head high when we're in a crowd.  On special occasions, when you shave under yore arms, well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yore charms.  Still them fellers at work, they all want to know, what I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe.  Like a good roll of duct tape yo're there fer yore man, to patch up life's troubles and fix what you can.  Yo're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. You ain't mean like those far ants I found in my bed.  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, you spark up my life more than a fresh load of dirt.  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, my life is complete; Ain't nuttin' I lack.  Yore complexion, it's perfection, like the best vinyl sidin'. despite all the years, yore age, it keeps hidin'.  Me 'n' you's  we go together  just like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank,  yep, we go together like a skunk goes with stank.  Some men, they buy chocolate for Valentine's Day; They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way.  Some men git roses on that special day from the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say.  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. "Diamonds are forever," they explain, suave and couth.  But for this man, honey, these won't do.  Cause yo're too special, you sweet thang you.  I got you a gift, without taste nor odor, more useful than diamonds...  IT'S A NEW TROLLIN' MOTOR!!  l shore due luv you darling,  AINT LOVE GRAND!!!!.....  BUBBA      
farmer-d	 Daren:  I have been informed that this meter has been disconnected.  The 215 has a  nom of 74/day at this meter.  The first day I have a -0- flow is 2/12/00.  Let me know if you have other information.  Thanks!  Charlotte

farmer-d	 Aimee/George:   Per Daren, we have a purchase deal at meter 9769, but the allocation is  nomed on the PG&E contract.  Could you please verify with Brian if this is  truely their gas or ours?  Thanks  Thu    
farmer-d	 Daren you are correct in that this was only in MOPS for the 26th.  It was  edi'd over to POPS from the 25th through the 31st populating all days with  the 16,700 nom.  The nom was never -0- out in POPS therefore the change  notification process in POPS did not pick up a change at this meter.  This  meter is pathed by Kim and confirmed by me - it is extremely odd that this  was missed in MOPS.  The record would have been out of balance and someone,  if not several people, normally would make a comment on this.   Also  -  all  of my records indicate that the 16,700 was good through the 31st except the  MOPS entry.  My confirmations with Koch didn't reflect the -0- ;  the last  report I have from Koch indicated the 16,700 stayed on, there was no record  of a phone call indicating anything other than 16,700.  It is very odd for  this many checks and balances to fail.  Also, the volumes were being sent  back to MOPS which no one caught.     I have spoken with Koch today and they agree that the 16,700 should have gone  to -0- therefore I have removed the nom from POPS confirmed volumes and  re-allocated the meter.  The OBA has taken the hit and I am working off the  imbalance now.  Daren, I am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my  responsibility.  Stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors  because I was buried in current activity, thus the e-mail to you asking for  your help.    If this doesn't answer all the questions, just give me a call.  Thanks,  Charlotte      Daren J Farmer 02/14/2000 12:50 PM To: Stella L Morris/HOU/ECT@ECT, Charlotte Hawkins/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Pat Clynes/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Re: Sale to Shoreline    Stella and Charlotte,   I looked into this deal.  We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the  path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated  and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a  bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified that  the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy  should have been found before we closed out January.  I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id  in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).   This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group,  who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not the  problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an  explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas  was confirmed for the 27th-31st.  Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the  OBA.  Unless you can find a missing transport contract.

He will either need  to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place.   This  deal 155118 is valid on 1/26/00 only, but the rest of the volume you are  looking for is scheduled on days 1/27 - 1/31.    I am sure there is no  pricing on those days.

We suggest printing it out and laying it out on your coffee table. That way, you have somewhere to set your "Red Stripe" so you don't leave rings on the table.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------  WELCOME TO THE eXPATRIATE ZONE  Welcome to the "First" Issue of "The eXPATRIATE ZONE," the official newsletter of the new "eXpatriate ZONE" web site. After publishing "The Temperate Zone" for the past two years, I'm taking the opportunity to join forces with Bob Segel who has been publishing "The Coconut Modem" with Karen Coyne since April of 1994.  Last year, after operating in AOL exclusively, Bob created "Parrotkey.com" out on the "Internet" where it would join it's sister site on AOL and be accessible to all Parrot Heads. At the time Bob expanded "PK," we had been working on my little area of "Club St. Somewhere," and the new "Parrotkey.com" seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the Club.  While we were talking about the direction we wanted to see "Club St. Somewhere" and "Parrot Key" go, we could see that this was the perfect chance to, as Emeril says, "Kick it Up a Notch." Jimmy Buffett's music was a big part of our lives, but even more so was the "Expatriate Lifestyle" he sang about. A lifestyle that includes tropical travel, sailing, boating, parasailing and surfing, and yes, the music and lyrics of Mr. James W. Buffett.  So it is, that we created our new web site, "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" <http://www.expatriatezone.com>, along with this newsletter of that same name. In December, "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" opened its doors with its "Island Trading Post" with its Holiday Shopping Service at the "Island Trading Post." Over 3,600 people visited the site the first day, and daily prizes were awarded for the first two weeks. The "Island Trading Post" will open again soon, offering a complete line of tropical items, not just to those of us that live a few blocks from Wal-Mart, but also for those of us lucky enough to be on a sailboat or living on an island. For not, we'll start with the "T-shirt of the Month." <http://www.eXpatriateZONE.com/islandstore> We want "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" to not only keep you entertained and informed while you toil away at your everyday "Corporate Gig," but it will also get you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into "The eXPATRIATE ZONE."  We hope you all enjoy our new effort, and also continue to visit "Parrot Key" and "Club St. Somewhere." Both of which will be closely associated with "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" and "Parrotkey.com."  Jackson & Bob  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------  "EXPATRIATE OF THE MONTH" JAMES "SUNNY JIM" WHITE  When I first ventured on the Internet in 1995, I ran in to a guy named "Sunny Jim" who was living down in the Cayman Islands. We never really got a chance to connect, for which I am truly sorry. But, when something is supposed to happen, it usually does.  On the first leg of my "Road Dawg" Tour <http://parrotkey.com/stsomewhere> (click on "Road Dawg") I stayed with my good friend Alex & Janet Leist and their wonderful children. Over the five days I stayed at their house, Alex and I listened to a lot of music, and one of the guys we both liked was "Sunny Jim." I bought one of James' CDs from Alex, and fell in love with it immediately. The CD was his second, called "Life in the Laid Back Lane."  Little did I know that I would meet up with James and his roady "Shady Floyd" several times over the next six months. James was embarking on his first real tour of the US since he moved "down island" almost twelve years ago. We got several chances to talk over the summer, and we will have an in depth article about this "Expatriate" soon on "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" web site. Be sure to watch for it.  In the meantime, here are a couple of quick things I learned about this great musician. When I asked him about his "Expatriate" status, his reply was, "Technically, an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country, for whatever reason. For some it's legal reasons, others just because they want to, or that's where the work is. I have been an expatriate for nearly twelve years now. I have pretty fully lived the whole Caribbean experience, from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing, to sailing, scuba diving, hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying palms."  Even as James is about to repatriate himself and his family, I ask if there were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate? "Maybe somewhere on the coast of Mexico or in a group of islands that are all within sailing distance of one another," was the advice he gave.  Until we can learn more of "Sunny Jim's" world, stop by his web site at <http://sunnyjim.com> and if you don't have one of his CDs, Including his latest release "Sandbar Serenade," for goodness sake, pick one up. You can also read a great interview Alex conducted with James at <http://members.xoom.com/_XOOM/LooneyMon/interviews/sunnyjim.htm>  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------  TRAVEL INTO "THE ZONE" "Some are running from the IRS"  We strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens and out into the real world as often as we can. Does this mean we give up one our most useful tools of communication, computers? Heck no! With laptops, cell phones and GPS systems, we can go anywhere, and still stay in touch if we feel the need. But get real and throw that "Pager" away as soon as you can.  We hope to keep this section current and informative, hopefully hearing from those of you already living your lives in "The Zone," helping the rest of us prepare for our getaway from the cities. I'm sure there are some of us that are preparing to "disappear" to places like Costa Rica, where the "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" will become an important tool.  How would you like to check out a place to "disappear" to and write it off your taxes at the same time? Want to go down into "The Zone" to places like the Bahamas, Belize, St. Croix, Puerto Rico, Bonaire, the Dominica Republic or Saba? Want to do something for the planet, work with dolphins, save a coral reef, or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time?  Well we have the answer. Check out these organization's Web Sites, and then get some advice from your financial advisor on 501C non-profit organizations. Depending on the tax bracket you're in, Uncle Sam could end up paying for up to half the trip.  The Oceanic Society <http://www.oceanic-societ.org> Earthwatch Institute    <http://www.earthwatch.org> REEF, The Reef Environmental Education Foundation   <http://www.reef.org>  After that, all that's left is to make that plane reservation, and remember, "No Plane on Sunday."  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------  "jimmyDOTcom"  After many delays, "jimmyDOTcom" has finally gone to the printer with a due date of the middle of April. I hit some "bumps in the road" on my way to publishing the first ever book about the Parrot Head Phenomena, but it was all worth it.  This book isn't about Jimmy Buffett, it's about the effect of the Internet on Parrot Heads. For more information, visit <http://www.jimmyDOTcom.com>. We have a complete outline of the book, reviews from other Parrot Heads, and samples of the pages on the site.  Financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1,000 copies at the present time, so if your even thinking of buying a book, I suggest you reserve your copy by putting your name on the "Reservation List." You will be under no financial obligation. It will simply indicate to my financial partners (who aren't Parrot Heads), just how many books we need to print. Do it right away, because pre-sales were brisk, and if enough of you reserve a copy, I can get the financing to expand the first printing.  Let's show the world what Parrot Heads stand for by making this book a big success. When I was on the BHOTM Tour this summer, I had many people tell me they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss. They wanted the boss to understand why getting the day off for a Buffett Concert is so important. Maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends "that just don't get it."  Here's one of the latest reviews of the book from Bob Robinson, Founder & President of the Sandlapper PHC in South Carolina. I had a great time with this club on the "Road Dawg" Tour, and shared an advance copy with his club:  "When we received Jackson's plea for pictures, our members were blown away. We hustled up a package of pix, as did a majority of the Parrot Head clubs from around the globe, and the result is pure Parrothedonistic pleasure. This collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time. If moderation is your key to life then stay away from JimmyDotCom, 'cause this book is packed with those stories only we can tell.  Congratulations BubbaFreak!"  BobRob   Sandlapper PHC   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------  CLUB TRINI UPDATE  Speaking of expatriates, how about the guys who play the true music of "The Zone?" Club Trini's long awaited Live CD will finally be coming out this April, one year after it's recording. Jimmy has been keeping Mike and Robert pretty busy, so it's understandable that it took awhile. It will be the third in the "Margaritaville Cafe - Late Nite" series. I can't wait to hear it, as my wife and I were some of the lucky ones who were in New Orleans when it was recorded.  You can get a look at all the songs included on the new CD at Club Trini's revamped web site at <http://clubtrini.com>. Along with the great songs we've become accustomed to, are a few I'm pretty excited about. If you haven't heard CT's version of "African Friend" you're in for a real treat. Along with that, is a song that Tina and Nadirah have been treating audiences to this past summer, "Cario" and Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry."  At the new web site, fans can "now" order their favorite Club Trini CDs using their credit cards. So there's no excuse to not owning everything available. I think a true "Expatriate Musical Library" is incomplete without Club Trini.  This summer, Helen Hiatt, Jimmy and The Coral Reefer's Wardrobe Designer, came up with a shirt that Club Trini members lovingly call the "Ice Cream Vendor" shirt, which they wear out front at the start of the concert. OK, Pete sometimes forgets his, and when he does have it on, it lost it's sleeves somewhere along the way. There's a great design that has been applied to a T-shirt that we all can own. Check it out at their site.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------  JESTERS AND FRIENDS NOTE CARD SERIES  Tro-Pics <http://Tro-pics.com> has just released their first Note Cards Series from their "Jesters and Friends" Original Oils. Friends, places and musicians from past years have inspired these cards and Parrot Heads and Expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times when an email just isn't personal enough.  The Original Artwork is also on sale at this site, so be sure to stop by and visit them. Included in the "Jesters" Series are our good Friends Tim Glancey and Wally Nickel.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------  MILLENNIUM CHANGE BUBBA STYLE  I've got to tell you, I wasn't buying into this "New Millennium" thing, one bit. In fact, I had almost decided not to go to the Buffett New Year's Eve Show. Nothing to do with Jimmy, but I just didn't get the whole hype. But at the last minute, I had a change of heart.  And now after being a special guest at Seagram's Party honoring the new Margaritaville Tequila, I'm sure glad I went. The shows kind of melded together for me, making the Millennium change over very special.  If you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both, visit our new "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" web site at  <http://expatriatezone.com> and go to the web version of this newsletter.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------  FLASH!!!  "EXPATRIATED PHANS" SPOTTED SOUTH OF THE BORDER  After making both of "Tropo Travel's" previous trips down to Cobo San Lucas, Mexico, I had to miss this year's trek due to my being with the "Beach House on the Moon" Tour on it's Florida, New Orleans and Houston swing.  As the story goes, those bad boys and girls from "The Expatriated Phan Club" <http://u1lvcm.com/gst/expat> showed up again, mainly for the T-shirts that said, "Too Much Tequila...Or Not Quite Enough" on the back. Who are those people anyway? Whenever I go to their web site, all of them have black bars covering their eyes. If you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for "Down to the Banana Republics - 2000" visit <http://tropotravel.com >Mike Mclain also has some other great trips planned this year, check them out.  Speaking of "Tropo Travel," if you need a hotel room for the Vegas or Irvine Shows and want a great deal, visit there site for some great rates. I'm joining some of my Parrot Head friends at the "Key Largo," though I'm kind of afraid to be in a town like Vegas with Sue and Ponch Aprea from the Detroit PHC. I'm joining a lot of my other friends I met on the road there too. I hate seeing Jimmy in Vegas, but I've got to keep the streak alive, and seeing all my Parrot Head friends will make it all worthwhile. I hope Peter Mayer ends up playing there again this year.  And speaking of those great T-shirts, we have some neat shirts available at the "Island Store." They're similar to the shirt you got if you went on this year's trip, except they have "Tropo Travel's" seaplane on the back and the  "No Bad Days" logo on the front breast. You can see a picture at <http://www.eXpatriateZONE.com/islandstore>.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------  PARROTHEAD PILOTS ASSOCIATION  Here are a couple of tidbits for your "Airplane Nuts" and pilots out there.  A new online friend who's a Medivac Chopper Pilot is trying to start a Parrot Head's Pilot's Association. If you're interested, contact Dan at <Medcopter1@aol.com>.  I also ran across a really cool page that features Jimmy's "Hemisphere Dancer" including it's "Jamaican Bullet Hole." Ed Booth, Jr. an attorney from Jacksonville, Florida, who belongs to "Lawyer-Pilots Bar Association" is the webmaster and creator.  The web site is "GRUMMAN N928J" (Flashback - How many of you remember the TV Show 'Whirly Birds'? Wasn't their number N975B?) and is at <http://lpba.org/buffett.html>  It shows a lot of pictures of Jimmy's 1954 Grumman I think you'll enjoy.  Now all we need is for these guys to team up with the Parrot Heads Pilot's Association.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------- This document is copyrighted 2000 by ST.

farmer-d	 We are increasing the volume delivered by HPL into Eastrans for 2/16 to 34,400 MMBtu.  Increase deliveries into PG & E to 27,400.  Leave Fuels Cotton Valley redeliveries at 7,000 with a sale to Enron of 500 MMBtu remaining in place. 
farmer-d	 Hal, as per our discussion here are the Logistics people that will be  dedicated to the ENom development:  Key subject experts:  The Logistics managers for each of the various regions will be the key  subject expert and will pull in the added resources (individual pipeline  schedulers) for the really detailed work. As far as time dedicated we will  commit to as much time as needed with the understanding that these  individuals do have the responsibility for managing all of the scheduling  activity in their regions. Bottom line is during bid-week and when  emergencies develop they will be needed at their trading desks. All meetings  with these individuals should be scheduled for the afternoon.   Kathy Kelly - Northeast Ed Terry - Southeast Randy Gay - West George Smith - Central Darren Farmer - Texas   Project Steering Team:  Bob Superty Randy Gay George Smith  As discussed we might have to bring in others when the product starts to take  shape and is impacting other areas (Global for example)   I look forward to our next meeting, thanks - Bob x30957   
farmer-d	 Please have the operating companies for both Daren Farmer and Stacey  Neuweiler moved from Enron North America (Co 413) to Houston Pipeline Company  (012) ASAP.  Additionally, if possible, please have payroll ensure that their  wages are not double dipped on Social Security.  The business reason for the  move is for compliance with the Railroad Commission's Code of Conduct.  There  is one other employee, Ami Chokshi, in Daren's RC which needs to remain as  ENA until I get a ruling from Legal.  The RC remains the same, 1497.   additionally, it is my understanding that there is no problem with multiple  operating companies within a group.  Let me know if you need anything further. 
farmer-d	 For 2/17, the nom into Eastrans is 37,625 MMBtu, which is 35,000 Mcf. Please increase nom into PG & E to 30,625 MMBtu.  7,000 will come from Fuels Cotton Valley, and sale of 500 MMBtu//d remains in place.

I  understand that I cannot renom this to the pipe for prior months, because the  callout allocations will be affected.

I need the contract in POPS for August  forward because I never know when Copano will allocate line gain to itself.  In 1998 a spot contract was set up between HPLR and Copano Pipeline/South  Texas, L. P. with a Synergi contract number 078-62210-101 and a Global number  of 96016880 by Karen Lambert.  Per Karen this old agreement was terminated by  Dan Hyvl due to HPLR business change to ECT.  In 1999, when Copano began  allocating line gain to themselves again I contacted Lauri, Karen, and  yourself to see if I could get the contract in POPS.  Karen sent me an e-mail  indicating that she set-up a new contract for this HPLC line gain purchase -  Global # 96022367 (I don't have a "Synergi" contract number).  I know that in  3/99 Lauri contacted Bernard Widacki at Copano to discuss this issue.  I need Lauri to review this and then I need the contract to be put in POPS so  that I can correctly allocate the gas at this meter.  I have not allocated  any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small.  Karen is the most  knowledgeable about this contract, so I suggest that any questions be  directed to her regarding contract issues.  Karen worked with Bernard Widacki  at Copano to set up the contract originally.  Thanks,  Fred                             
farmer-d	 Just want to pat each of you on the back, and express my appreciation to each  of you for taking time out of your schedules to meet yesterday.  The results  of our time exceeded my expectations in that I feel we had quality discussion  and also identified some ideas and solutions to put in place quickly.  Each  of you contributed concerns and discussion ideas in a very professional and  positive manner.   I also realize we have some follow-up to do, and would  like for us to schedule our next time to meet.  I don't want to establish  these discussions as "quarterly" or "monthly" meetings at this point - I'm  not sure what frequency would be appropriate.  We can discuss it further as a  team.  However, I know we at least one more session and I don't want much  time to elapse before we reconvene.   Yvette:  Would look at a time when everyone would be availble in March,  preferably the week of 3/6, 3/13 or 3/20.  This may be difficult to schedule  as Daren will be working around a new baby, and others are working around  vacation time.  I anticipate a similar structure to yesterday's, but am very  open to other's ideas.  Please let Yvette know if you some other idea.  I also want to express my appreciation to Yvette for organizing the  afternoon.  She did a great job!!!  Thanks to each of you!! 
farmer-d	 Daren,   I am sorry I completely forgot to provide you with the meters, there should  be a total of eight.  Please let me know when you have it set up.  Thanks  Thu    
farmer-d	 Meter 0984179 Hoff Heller Unit #22 CDP was shut-in at approximately 9:20 AM  today (February 17, 2000).    On Wednesday, February 16, the meter was found flowing 25 lb dew point gas.   The pumper was given 24 hours to correct the problem.  On February 17, the  meter was found flowing 40 lb dew point gas.  If you have any questions please call me at 36449.  Thanks Gary H

farmer-d	 Daren,  Stacey is out of the office today, I hope you can help.  Deal 107937 was  originally set up for 155,000, but the nom was changed to 140,000.  I show  5,000 was purchased from Conoco, where did HPLC get the additional 135,000?   Sitara shows HPLC IM Wellhead.    Joanie Ngo says TXU is saying they bought  155,000.   I am trying to back track to the purchase invoices to see what we  were invoiced.

farmer-d	 Based on the conversation we had  at the meeting last Thursday, I am  implementing the following changes to Humble Gas Pipeline and King Ranch Gas  Plant.  If you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the  items below, please be sure to call me asap.  1. Input HPLC purchase from HPLR Liquids at meter 8793 (HPL/HGPL).  Remove  the 3 Rivers gas from the Interconnect ticket and input on  the Purchase Deal.  2. Input HPLC sale to HPLR Liquids at meters 9643 (KGPL/HPL) and 12  (KGPL/HGPL).  Remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets   at these meters and input on the sales Deals appropriately.  3. Change swing parameters for the King Ranch contracts to swing on Cage  Ranch before swinging on 3 Rivers Gas.  This will hopefully allow   the sale for 3 Rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible.  I will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day, and  have all contracts repathed.  It is my understanding that we are implementing  these changes effective Feb. 1st.  Stella,  This may or may not effect repathing of the HPLC gas at meter 9643,  based on the swing parameters that you have been using.  Thank you.

farmer-d	 Hey guys,  Just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue.  While I agree that  Howard, Robert and George needed to work on this together, I do not think  that Howard should have been the driving force behind this.  Once we left the  meeting, they all convened on the 37th floor and worked from Howard's desk -  with Howard sitting down doing much of the work.  I also think that the below  e-mail should not have come from Howard, but should have originated out of  the Logistics group.  I understand that Howard has prior scheduling  experience, but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially  took on that role in getting this set up correctly.  He too had to sit down  and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly  (?).  In my opinion this is a kudoo for Howard for stepping up, but I am  concerned at the role that he played.  Team effort is important and it's what  we all want between our groups, but I want to ensure that everyone does their  fair share and expectations are appropriately placed.  Let me know what you  both think.

farmer-d	 In order to ensure that all computer-related equipment is being properly  capitalized and not expensed in your RC, I would like to centralize the  purchase of equipment for Energy Operations.  Going forward, if you need to  purchase equipment for a new employee or need to upgrade your existing PC  and/or monitor, please send me an E-mail containing the following information:  Employee Name (indicate if the employee is new) Location Phone Extension Equipment you would like to purchase Existing system number if upgrading your PC  I have set up an RC exclusively to capture purchases of computer-related  equipment.  This will make it easier to properly capitalize these assets.  One more thing I need for each of you to do.  Please review your RC reports  for January 2000 and make sure that there aren't any PC purchases charged to  your RC.  You can find them in Cost Category 601 "Non-Capitalized Hardware  and Software".  If you had any charges in this category for equipment, please  forward a copy of your RC report to me as soon as possible so that I can work  with Brian Heinrich to have the charges reversed from your RC in February.  If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 3-6343.  Thank you in  advance for your help to ensure that your RC does not go over budget for  purchases of equipment that should be properly capitalized.  Lisa Cousino x3-6343

farmer-d	 Kellie-  I researched the statements you sent me and found deal ticket #109925 in  Sitara which shows HPLC transporting on Midcon from Live Oak to Hardy Street  for $.04/mm for the months of August and September.  The statement for November covers gas moving from Katy tailgate to Cogen  Lyondell and is covered by Sitara deal ticket #133257.  The deal ticket shows  a zero rate, however.  Elsa/Daren- do either of you remember this deal?  It  was on November 30th for 5000mm.  Kellie- what is Midcon charging for this  haul?  Thanks. 
farmer-d	 Daren, tell Tonya I called Edie last night about my W-2.  She said that they got a new CPA & he has been told to mail them but hasn't.  She gave me the amount that will show on the form.  It was $1500. I wrote it down at home how much the net was, but I didn't bring it with me.  I had drawn some off paying for Lacy's Tiger Doll stuff.  She said that she would tell him again to get them mailed. Love, Ma ______________________________________________________ Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com

I set up an accounting  arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would  you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID?    The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement  gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it  either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the  deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up  an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number  and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set  up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you  can put the contract at meter 9643.  Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.  Thanks,  Fred 
farmer-d	 FYI,  I was watching the position manager for ENA and noticed some business  transactions on this pipeline.  This pipeline was bought by Duke Energy Field  Services effective 8/1/99.  All HPLC transactions were moved to that pipe at  that time.  The CES transactions that are current on this pipe should be  moved to Duke Energy Field Services.  I believe the pipe was renamed when  they bought it back in June or July.  If you have any questions, or want to verify this information, I would check  with the Global contracts dept.

farmer-d	 Daren, I was right the first time.  You gave me what I need.  Sorry again for the  inconvenience. 
farmer-d	 Over the past several weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of  "killed" or modified EOL transactions.   Please remind each of your  respective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer "clicks" on a  deal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we  can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark  Taylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a  termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We  (Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to  change an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824),  Frank Davis (x37235), or Dale Neuner (39746).   Call me if you have any questions.  Sheri x36557

farmer-d	 Hello,  We are starting to prepare the February data for our model.  Please provide a  completed "Hours" survey for each position within your group.  This survey  will collect the the time your team spent on performing their activities in  the month of February.    At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labeled "Select Your RC".   Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits. Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message "Select  Position from Drop Box!" You can then select the position (i.e., staff,  specialist, etc.) and "OK". The choices for positions are based on  information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed  that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that  corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of  activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity  listed in the column labeled "Hours". If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the  positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.   If you do not, the information will be lost.  We have included January compiled hours per position (if you had two  specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the "Last Month"  column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you  have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send  this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill  out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you  perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible  for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.  Please return these surveys by end of day Friday, March 3rd.  If this is a  problem, please notify immediately.  Thanks, Shari 3-3859 
farmer-d	 This is the final list for February 2000 for counterparty name changes and  mergers.

If this is an issue for  anyone, please call me right away to discuss.   All documentation will be copied and forwarded as usual.   Thanks! MC 
farmer-d	 As you are aware, we are starting to collect data for our February price  model. I've attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be  driving your costs from the activities to the commercial teams.  Please  select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for  the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver survey  with February numbers for your RC by end of day Friday, March 3rd.  If your  group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data,  please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list beginning  next month.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey every  month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone within  your team beginning next month, please let me know.    Please take this opportunity to verify the following: 1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to  perform these activities for each commercial team. 2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified  (please let us know otherwise) 3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example "Allocate 0469" or  "80-20 Split"), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not  changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new  allocation is).  In reference to these surveys, please note: If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams  listed in the survey, please identify them.  We will take your business  support costs (such as feedback, training, etc.) and allocate them evenly  among these teams. The costs for "commercial team specific" activities that you filled time out  for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial  team (e.g. Genco Support will trace 100% of its costs to Genco).    Please let us know if you have any questions on this survey.    Regards, Shari 3-3859

farmer-d	 As a follow-up to Stephen Schwarz's message below regarding training  resources, I wanted to let everyone know that there will not be a charge in  2000 for any Energy Operations employee to attend any training classes that  have been developed by Energy Operations (i.e., Sitara, Unify and  Magellan/LiveLink).  There will be a charge to your RC, however, if an Energy  Operations employee signs up for one of these classes and fails to cancel  within the established guidelines.  I know there was a lot of concern regarding your budget and costs for  training classes after the Corporate Training Department announced that there  would be a change in policy this year.  Your RC will be charged a fee for any  course that your employee signs up and attends through ERNIE.  I just wanted  to clarify the costs associated for any systems training detailed above will  not be charged to your RC even though you and your employees use ERNIE to  register for these classes.  I have instructed the people in the Training  Department who are in charge of billing to follow this policy.  If you  receive a charge in error on your RC report, please let me know immediately  so that I can make the necessary corrections.  If you have any further questions, please call me.  Thanks.

farmer-d	  Daren,  EOG  is having problems with that same well 6296 but this time it's  compressor problems.  They think that it will be for at least a week but you  know how that goes.  They would like to drop the volume again to 4400.  If we  change don't Kim will have an imbalance at this meter (she wanted me to let  you know that).  Meter # 6598 YATES  would like to change the volume from  4206 to 3366, and Vintage who had been over producing last month would like  to increase from 270 to 320 to match the real flow.  I know these are  bothersome changes but I'm trying to get the best numbers for both you and  Vance for the up coming month.  Let me know and I'll be on the go  from the "  THE TOM CAT" 
farmer-d	 I have identified the additional HPLC wellhead purchases and have made  corrections to the interconnect tickets accordingly.  Jackie is still having  difficulty identifying all the wellhead purchase.  We feel there are at least  6 meters flowing a total of appox. 7000 a day that are not showing up on a  HPLC purchase or a HPLR transport.  I believe she has given you this  information and will await instructions or for the purchases to be input  reflecting the proper Enron Entity purchasing these volumes.  We have worked very hard on this issue and I apologize that it has not yet  been entirely corrected.

In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the  deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up  an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number  and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set  up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you  can put the contract at meter 9643.  Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.  Thanks,  Fred        
farmer-d	 Stacy,   Oasis only show a delivery of 330,000 at point 1427.

The additional 10000 is pathed on Mtr 1516. Do I cut  deal 157279 by 10000 to make up to Lower Colorado? If so, could you please  path it at point 1427 so that I will tie back to Oasis.

This was a late  Friday change so in order to get it scheduled in POPS, the gas was scheduled  on the stranger's gas contract.  However, deal ticket #143709 was never  updated to reflect those late changes.  Please let me know if you want me to  update the deal ticket.  Thanks, Susan.         
farmer-d	 Hi,  I figured something must be occupying your time other than answering  non-business e-mail.  You guys must all be getting double salaries for doing 2 jobs each. ----  right? (chuckle).  If Tom really lets you take the time off for the baby and if you really have  the time; lunch would be great. Just give me a call. Only if all the ifs  really allow you the time.  Is Craig ok?? I hope.  I would be glad to help with your sprinkler system. My sharpshooter is older  than you are, but I imagine it is built a little better. My requested wages  for that sort of work would make renting a trencher very cheap for you. I  would be happy to come by and keep an eye on the cold beer. That would be  free of charge.  I'm having a cable modem installed Monday. Supposed to be 50-70 times faster  than what I have. I do way to much jumping around to run off this slow modem.  I can then dump my other phone line. Actually will end up spending less for  more speed. I love technology.  Thanks for the info on the stock option. That is the closing price as of  1/18/00, which is right before the jump. very nice of management. I like to  know the number to see what might be affecting the price.  Well good luck on the extra job and give our best to Tonya ---- Not much  longer to go...........  Ken    - att1.htm

farmer-d	 Daren, EOG  called and said that the well behind 986296 which has been down  for a week from 7100 to 4400 for the last week or so needs to stay at the  4400  for the rest of the month.  I  changed the ticket for that.  This was  per Suzanne Saldivar.  Also Shoreline reduced the meter 6722 from 30 to 24.   also changed that. last Cody went from 7666 to 7600 at meter 6722.  Both  Shoreline and Cody were per customer request. 
farmer-d	 Shoreline has sent in a nom change for the 11th gas day,  to take meter 6722  from 24 to 14.  Please let me know if you want the change. 
farmer-d	 Hi Daren,  Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters  can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so  that Anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me?  98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the deal  is not effective until  February the 11th.      No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the  gathering (96026573) K which is the only      K @ the meter.  98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is  flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/2000  production which is the only K @ the meter.   Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497 
farmer-d	 PLEASE USE THE POSITION MANAGER HOME BUTTON.  When using the SITARA Position Manager,  and you drill down to view details  or change the dates, the Position Manager keeps all your views running in the background.  This feature allows you to use the  BACK and FORWARD buttons to keep your views running. On the downside, if you keep these views running but do not really intend to  go BACK to look at them, the system and your PC are working harder to keep all the old views active and updated.    The HOME button sends you back to your default view - the first view you had  up when you hit apply.  By clicking this button, your Position Manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in.    This is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need.   If you do not use the HOME key, and keep drilling in and changing the dates,  the Position Manager is still keeping all the your views for  the day running in the backgound.       What we have found is by the end of the day, a user that does not clear out  the old views can have well over 30 views open, which is like having 30 Position Managers up on your PC.  When that user closes down, the position  gets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views.  We will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as far  as the SITARA machine is concerned; however, your PC may still be  slow with excessive unneccessary views open.   We could make a change to  limit the number of active views you can have open, but at this time I am not sure that is necessary; regardless, in the mean time, please  remember to use your HOME button.     Other helpful hints -   Did you know you can shrink you tool bar?  Tools options - uncheck show tool  bar text labels -     Did you know you can split your position screen to have pipes on top and  zones and meters below? Tools Options - show drill down second panel -     If you have an OMICRON POSITION porfolio - your MIN/MAX button shows you  ACTUAL - and MIN/MAX for your day swing deals. Same works for NOM FLEX portfolio.

Should Daren or Julie get back w/you, while I'm on vacation, please get back  w/Anita Luong and provide her with the K # given to you (by Daren or Julie)  as well as the dates of 2/1 - 2/29 (even though 3/1/2000 is reflected in my  allocation exception screen) so that she can provide you with an accounting  arrangement to place February's volumes on @ this meter.  It looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3/1/2000.  I guess that the  trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter.

How do you  plan to get this gas to King Ranch since HPLR Liquids does not have a  transport on Humble?  Daren, the intercompany HPLC purchase  is how it is set up currently in MOPS.

farmer-d	 Aimee:  I need a desk to desk deal set up at meter 378 for February 2000.  It is an  ENA sale (delivery) on the 202 contract and an HPL buy (receipt) on the HPL  216 contract.  This is a very high priority because the bridge will close  today.  If possible would you have this completed by Noon today?  Thanks,  Fred 
farmer-d	 Daren and Lauri:  We do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters.  When MIPS receives an  "incomplete" from the parent meter it sends a -0- to POPS.  Yes, this is a  big problem.  Our POPS team (Romeo D'Souza) has identified this problem and  notified MIPS.  However, he was told this was not a priority item.   In the  mean time we are overriding the volumes in POPS with the estimated volumes.  This particular meter was correct last night, the 14th rolled last night from  MIPS and overrode the BAV with a -0- from day 14 forward.  This was corrected this morning and the meter re-allocated.

The more critical part of  this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some  of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have  not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the  extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a  hit when these actual volumes flow through.  I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a  problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered.   Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving  correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.

farmer-d	 Stephanie,  The problem with the January payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly  in sitara.   For January production deal 153864 shows HPLC purchasing gas  from GMT Company Inc, not GMT Inc.  Someone needs to either correct the deal  for 1/00 or put in a new deal, then I can do an accounting arrangement to  make the necessary correction.    It is correct for 2/00 on deal 156292.  I  emailed Daren on this because I see his name in sitara as the contact, but I  am not sure who actually takes care of it.    ---------------------- Forwarded by Sherlyn Schumack/HOU/ECT on 03/22/2000  10:27 AM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Thu Nguyen                           03/20/2000 03:07 PM 	  To: Sherlyn Schumack/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Stephanie Gomes/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Meter # 0989814 - GMT, Inc. - 1/00 production  Sherlyn,   I believe this is your meter........ ---------------------- Forwarded by Thu Nguyen/HOU/ECT on 03/20/2000 03:05 PM  ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Stephanie Gomes                           03/18/2000 09:21 AM 	  To: Thu Nguyen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Meter # 0989814 - GMT, Inc. - 1/00 production  Thu, I'm not sure if this is your meter or not.

farmer-d	 I combined the tickets for the Southern Union plants at Port Arthur and  Galveston for April forward to accurately reflect the contract.  The new  Sitara number is 224490, and the old numbers are: 17832 and109216. This  change will allow for a more accurate estimate in our P&L as well as more  accurate invoicing. I believe that this change will reduce our monthly  variances due to these deals.   If you have any questions or concerns please  feel free to give me a call  Bryan  3-9195

farmer-d	 I have a request from the ENA settlements group.  Williams Energy is billing  the HPL purchase deals on the ENA invoice.  The accountant at Williams says,  that by the request of the HPL trader, the deals are to be billed to ENA.  We  would like to have the Texas deals billed directly to HPL.  If you do not  have a problem with this, can you ask your counterpart at Williams to split  the deals between HPL and ENA?  It would make the payment process much easier.  Thanks, Megan x5-7480

farmer-d	 The MTBE plant had an upset early today and a steam boiler is being taken out  of service.  Production will be cut back to approximately 8 MBD to 9 MBD for  four to five days. 
farmer-d	 The earliest time production of MeOH may begin is now Sunday evening. 
farmer-d	 Good afternoon!  No, this isn't a new tip - just a follow-up on the one I sent this morning. I received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them  along.  Kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm, except for one thing: he's had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the base, so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect. I referred to this briefly at the end of the tip, but here's a quick solution for avoiding the problem.  Before routing the dado in the gauge, first mark a point on the base of your router. (I simply add a piece of masking tape since it's easy to see.) Then when routing the gauge (and later, the panel), always keep this mark against the straightedge. Your dadoes should be right on.  Another email came in from Mike, who suggested making two alignment gauges. Then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you clamp the straightedge fence down. This prevents the "wiggling" that often occurs when one end is clamped before the other. Great tip!  A big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions. It's great to hear that so many people are enjoying the tips.  Talk to you again in a few weeks.

farmer-d	 The MTBE plant will continue operating at lower production rates of  approximately 8 MBD to 9 MBD until April 6 or 7 at the earliest.  It will  possibly be mid-April before full production can be resumed.  This is the  result of the steam boiler problem experienced on Friday, March 24.  When  more information is available, this will be updated.

On a side note, we will bring down our gas  turbine generator on Sunday morning.  This will bring our high pressure gas  requirements down to essentially zero (it will be zero if our Hydrogen Plant stays down)  and the demand will transfer to our low pressure gas.  We will be in this arrangement for approximately 20 days.  Brian

Actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be  3 days max.   This outage time, which is longer than the norm, is due to the  fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same  ditch before tie ins take place.    As an update, the first train is now scheduled to cross late today.  They now  say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are  able to begin replacing our line.     --------------- I have been advised by the Deer Park RR representative, Dean Truitt,  that  the rail cars will begin arriving on 3/15/00.    Per our conversations today, please have someone on Tuesday 3/13 adjust the  regulators at Simpson and at Shell Deer Park so that 280 psig is the maximum  pressure in that pipeline section.     I will maintain contact with Deer Park on the duration of this project and  keep you informed.  It is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction  will be on the order of 2 weeks.    After the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility, Deer  Park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline  replacement  at that location.  This replacement would involve an outage on  this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days.  I would anticipate that  this outage would occur in early April.  Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  Danny

farmer-d	 As you are aware, we are starting to collect data for our March price model.  I've attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be driving your  costs from the activities to the commercial teams.  In the 'Data' tab, please  select the your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver  for the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver  survey with March numbers for your RC by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If  your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed  data, please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list  beginning next month.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey  every month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone  within your team beginning next month, please let me know.    Please take this opportunity to verify the following: 1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to  perform these activities for each commercial team. 2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified  (please let us know otherwise) 3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example "Allocate 0469" or  "80-20 Split"), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not  changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new  allocation is).  In reference to these surveys, please note: If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams  listed in the survey, please identify them.  We will take your business  support costs (such as feedback, training, etc.) and allocate them evenly  among these teams. The costs for "commercial team specific" activities that you filled time out  for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial  team (e.g. Genco Support will trace 100% of its costs to Genco).    Please let us know if you have any questions on this survey.    Regards, Shari 3-3859

farmer-d	 Stella, It is very important  that King Ranch is accurately scheduled in the  system.   Sitara should be updated with any changes so that Daren can properly manage the Texas Desk position.   Hopefully we have moved enough off of your desk to allow  you to concentrate on King Ranch.  Too many  discrepancies have been made and it is very costly to the desk.    Robert can assist if needed.      Thanks,    Pat  
farmer-d	 Daren,  The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan.  2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru  the 31st.

farmer-d	 The above meter is currently doing 13.0 on a 26.0 nom.  Please take a look and see if nom adjustments might be a solution.  Looking @ deal #109670, the terms indicates that HPLC buys 2.5% of Saxet  volumes.  Should I assume that I should take the total flow amount (per day  for this deal ticket) and adjust the expected volumes to reflect a nom that  is 2% of the daily flow versus the "1" that is currently nomed?  H -  E  -  L  -  P!!!  Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497

farmer-d	 FYI....  This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the  ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.  Impact to Logistics - Unify If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge  backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name  will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place. One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production  yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths) This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where  nominations were sent for entire month) can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe  guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing. Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause  an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order  to get a clean quick response. What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take  place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)  I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I  can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to  put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when  these type of changes are needed.  Will keep you posted.  Thanks,  dg        	 	 	From:  Thomas Engel                           04/05/2000 09:44 AM 	  To: Kathryn Cordes/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dana Daigle/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Elizabeth L  Hernandez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, B Scott Palmer/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dianne J Swiber/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peggy  Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT, Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT cc: Sylvia A Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda S Bryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Faye  Ellis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Consemiu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ  Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Martha Stevens/HOU/ECT@ECT, Karie Hastings/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Regina Perkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Imelda Frayre/HOU/ECT@ECT, William E  Kasemervisz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Hunaid Engineer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steven  Gullion/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larrissa Sharma/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Greif/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)   Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with  confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:  If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the  ability for you to invalidate the deal - and  then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:  "Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure  pipeline allows this change."     Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is  feedback - I assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems  (pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new  deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.  Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just  in case it causes problems with their pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask  the UNIFY team.  There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM  Market East - but not from  ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be  the same legal entity.  "Warning - not the same legal entity"  Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals  (Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out). Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items  were locked down for a reason.  If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down  data that was validated - and someone used these deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created  using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check  with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in  UNIFY.      ---------------------- Forwarded by Thomas Engel/HOU/ECT on 04/05/2000 09:47  AM --------------------------- From: Scott Mills on 04/04/2000 07:38 PM To: Kathryn Cordes/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dana Daigle/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Elizabeth L  Hernandez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, B Scott Palmer/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dianne J Swiber/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Steve Jackson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas Engel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sylvia A  Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda S Bryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Faye Ellis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna  Consemiu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)    With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be  able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other  than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).

farmer-d	 Changing counterparty names on Sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact  to any downstream processes.    I hope the following will give more clarification.     Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail!   Thanks, dg  3-9517   Sitara / Unify - Process * Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had  been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify. * Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely  harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues. * Process -  Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.    Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.   The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify. Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change) Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now  highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high  level, not on path) The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path  Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info) Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info) The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all  information is correct) Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.   (all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match  up perfectly) Settlements utilizes information in Unify.   Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which  would create two notification entries If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur. (note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)   Autonoms "Tom's words of warning" -  Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after  deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI  path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already  nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the  pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct  the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to  manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify  (as explained above).

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the  ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.  Impact to Logistics - Unify If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge  backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name  will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place. One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production  yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths) This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where  nominations were sent for entire month) can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe  guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing. Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause  an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order  to get a clean quick response. What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take  place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)  I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I  can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to  put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when  these type of changes are needed.  Will keep you posted.

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is  feedback - I assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems  (pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new  deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.  Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just  in case it causes problems with their pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask  the UNIFY team.  There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM  Market East - but not from  ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be  the same legal entity.  "Warning - not the same legal entity"  Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals  (Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out). Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items  were locked down for a reason.  If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down  data that was validated - and someone used these deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created  using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check  with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in  UNIFY.      ---------------------- Forwarded by Thomas Engel/HOU/ECT on 04/05/2000 09:47  AM --------------------------- From: Scott Mills on 04/04/2000 07:38 PM To: Kathryn Cordes/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dana Daigle/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Elizabeth L  Hernandez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, B Scott Palmer/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dianne J Swiber/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Steve Jackson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas Engel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sylvia A  Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda S Bryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Faye Ellis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna  Consemiu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)    With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be  able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other  than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).

farmer-d	 Thanks for the info!   As Greg mentioned in the staff meeting today, the intent is that this  restructured deal is papered effective 4/1/00.  The impact is potentially  that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate  transport/gathering agreements, etc.  If any rates are changing, then those  need to be changed in our systems also.  There may be other areas of changes  also - I'm not attempting to list them all.  Rather I just want to make  people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations.

farmer-d	 -----Original Message----- From: Celestedeo@aol.com Sent: Tuesday, April 11, 2000 1:21 PM Subject: Special Prayer Request   Hi,  I am coming to you with a very special prayer request.  We have some good friends here in Nashville, Mark and Melanie Burress and their one year old baby Gracie, who have recently received some devastating news.  Mark was diagnosed in December with leukemia.  His is normally a very slow spreading form of the disease but unfortunately his is spreading extremely fast.  He also has a rare DNA type and only about 12 people on the bone marrow donor list (out of 4.5 million) were possible matches and all have since been elimnated.  We held a bone marrow drive in his behalf at church this past weekend and over 1200 people came to donate.  This amazed the people running the drive because they said they normally get a few hundred at the most.  If a donor is not found by June his chances are very, very slim to live to July.  He has chosen to have his bone marrow transplant in Houston at the Anderson hospital so I am asking if there is anyone in Houston who knows of a strong, supportive congregation near the hospital that they may attend (when possible) while they are there, that would be greatly appreciated.  If a donor is located, they say the transplant procedure is very difficult and he won't be able to have any contact with his baby for several months due to his immune system being weakened.  As you can imagine, this would put his wife in a severe state of limbo, having to be primary caregiver to someone who is incapacitated and a baby without the two being able to be together.  It is difficult to watch someone with so much to give and so much to live for to be facing such a hard fight.  Please keep his family in your prayers and I know if there is a miracle with Marks' name on it, God will provide it.  If you could please pass this on to the Chi Sigs/Regina list, every little prayer they get will be appreciated.  Thank you!  Celeste (Sasser) Ortega

farmer-d	 There was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of March.  The HMS technician  did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he  will have to get with them again.  I have notified the tech and he is in the  process of doing this.  The meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open.  Gas Control's  understanding and the field's understanding is that at the time the  Brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place.  If this  is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the  valve.  Robert,    In the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow  volume without a nomination in place please check with Earl and myself so we  can investigate before we get commercial involved.

farmer-d	 Daren - Would there be a problem if I created a desk to desk for meter 378  for  March 2000 going forward?  It would help out with the allocation  process.  The kind of deal I need is the total opposite of deal # 115101.   Please let me know if there is a problem. Volume management would like this  done today.

farmer-d	 Daren , There seems to be two noms that are not in the system that need to be  nomed from the first on.  Ames meter 5077 and senora meter 6686.  both had  thckets that were not extended into april.

farmer-d	 Southern Union for May 2100 83 st 2100 Port Arthur  These are my estimates. The volumes for April at T-ville and Colorado RS are  either spot or April only. Janet does not know about next month yet. So, 5000 total is a safe assumption.

farmer-d	 Deal # 157288 Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal  from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.

It has had a nom of 1.000/day (429.000 total mmbtus) since  1/28/99 and has flowed only 11.692.  Am I correct to say that this meter  needs a lower nom?  Please let me know if I should look out for a lower nom  in May.  Pat seems to think this may be affecting the P/L for April.  We only  have estimates/actuals of zero on 4/1 & 4/2.

Apparently the workorders themselves  were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in MSA.  We have  corrected the workorder set-ups and they should be working now.  As for prior  costs, I think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we  attempted to code to EHURR and EHSET, and then book an entry in April that  would reclass them to the workorders.  We would then be able to see all the  costs associated with the project, as you wanted to do from the beginning,   and code any future costs directly to the workorders.  I will let you know  more when I finalize that this can really be done, I just wanted to keep you  updated on the progress.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks, Brian

The duration of the  problem was due to a type of system behavior we had not experienced before.   The problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinking  that a fresh login might work better.  Additional logins never improve  performance and generally degrade it, but that is another story.  (There was  actually a single user with 21 sessions!)  We had to "bounce" the server  twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance.  The good news is that we found out what caused the problem.  It was not a  particular user or a particular report or process.  It was actually an  intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in  the past, but this particular change had drastic side effects.  We have  contacted Sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the  behavior is a "feature" or a bug.  In the meanwhile, we will do these types  of changes at night during scheduled outages.  I apologize for the frustration, anxiety, and extra work brought on by this  problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again.   If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to give me a  call.  Dave N.

farmer-d	 Shoreline wants to increase the volume at  meter 9830 for the 10th gas day.   This is a new meter so there is not much history to it.  They want to go from  535 to 750.  last month it flowed in the upper 500's  but it didn't come on  till the 21st of the month.

farmer-d	 Just to update you on this project's status:  Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come up  with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas off  of HPL's pipe.  Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc. Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc. Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P Corpus Christi  Gas Marketing, LP  Southern Union Company D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.   Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes  suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing  something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him  and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the  above contracts.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Cheryl Dudley/HOU/ECT on 05/10/2000 07:56  AM ---------------------------   	Cheryl D King 	05/08/2000 04:11 PM 	 Sent by: Cheryl Dudley To: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary M Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: ENA Sales on HPL  I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you  could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for  which she is looking.  She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA &  HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to  accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is  doing off of HPL's pipe.  I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity  on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will  this give me everything that I need?  Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in  Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas  on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --   ?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?  Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some  of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any  ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!  Thanks in advance.

farmer-d	 With pre-bid coming up, how should I handle CES? Who will be responsible for  June info? Also, who on the trade floor will be the Devon contact? Bob  Superty asked me to be the point person initially, so maybe he has another  person in mind (Ed Terry or Kathy Kelly - secondary contacts) that he would  like to handle it besides someone on the Texas desk. This way it could free  our group up from that task. Part of the reason I was handling it was because  I wanted to make sure nothing that affects Texas slips through the cracks,  especially in the beginning. Please advise.  Ami

farmer-d	 The MTBE plant went down about 1 a.m. on Saturday morning, May 20, as a  result of power failure.  Apparently lightning knocked out the power  substation.

farmer-d	 Hey-  both of you guys did a great job on Janet's deal. The pricing was done  correctly. The swing I wasn't aware of, but 5000+- per month is not a big  deal. The problem was that offers didn't get stood on. 
farmer-d	 This is to nom 32,500 MMBTU into Eastrans for 5/24.  5/23 volume was reduced to 7,800 MMBtu with all redeliveries coming from Fuels Cotton Valley.  Duke only - For 5/24, the redeliveries will be 25,000 MMBtu per day at  Carthage into Enron's cartwheel agreement and 7,800 from Fuels Cotton Valley.  Sales at the tailgate will be 4,250  MMBtu/d for 5/24.  For 5/23, the sales will be 7,020 MMBtu/d.  
farmer-d	 Stacey,  Settlements has brought an invoice to zero out a sale of 10,000 mmbtu to El  Paso Merchant Energy for 4/20/00 on PGEV.  There are 2 packages of  5000 deal  numbers 247426 and 247583 on the market side and deal 247676 on the supply  side.  These are HPLC brokered deal on PGEV that are buying and selling the  same 10,000 to El Paso Merchant Energy.  The purchase and sale price is the  same $3.02.  I do not know the intent of these deals so I am hesitant to just  zero out the volume.   Will you let me know if that is okay?

This product will NOT bridge into Sitara and will  have to be put in manually.   The reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple  stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date. Currently,  EnronOnline can only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge  monitor and will have to be manually entered into Sitara & subsequently  cleared out of the monitor.   Since these transactions could flow next day, it is imperative that these  transactions get into Sitara as soon as possible. Please read the FULL  description below. (This product looks like a month long deal but excludes  weekends. The "Wkd" is short for week days.)  We do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be  prepared to react quickly when they do. For the future, we are looking into  the cost/benefit of EnronOnline having the capability of sending multiple  dates for these types of products.  If you have any questions, please call me at 3-5824 Thank you.     ---------------------- Forwarded by Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT on  05/23/2000 02:05 PM --------------------------- Dale Neuner   05/23/2000 10:26 AM  To: David Forster/Corp/Enron@Enron, Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer  deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jason Althaus/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jason  Althaus/Corp/Enron@Enron, Melba Lozano/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: 24 x 5 Products  We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow,  May 24th.   The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas  desk. It will be identified as follows:  US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM  This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in  that the Product  description has an  indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day  that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,  Thursday or Friday.  These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be  diligent to identify these Products based  on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are  entered into Sitara correctly (presumably -  strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days  and/or month-ending days).  We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these  transactions and have asked the appropriate systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider  building bridge capability. In the interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low,  and will ask for higher prioritization of the bridging in the event that volumes increase.  Dale 3-9746

farmer-d	 I updated the June transport usage tickets today through HPL, and will be  finishing these tickets tomorrow.  Rates have been updated to reflect current  matrix rates and all baseload rates that I know of at this time.  I have not  yet received third party transport rates, so if you know of any, please let  me know.  Also, I have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for June, so  your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them.  Rule of thumb  was that if I had to add a month, I refreshed the rate but left volume at  zero.  If the months were already on the ticket, then I refreshed the rate  and left the volume as is.  I would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure  they're reflected in Position Manager correctly.  Please let me know if you  have any questions.  All pipes will be updated by tomorrow morning.  Heidi

Merry and the baby went home this afternoon and he has now  been named. He is Brandon Aaron Byington  Hi there, Darren & Tonya,  Merry and Doc had their new baby at 9:26 AM yesterday. No name yet. They are  still trying to settle on one, so in the mean time, I'm just calling him "New  Child" Byington.  He weighed 7 lbs 2 oz and was 19 1/4" long. Merry, Doc, and "New Child" are  doing fine. Doc was in there during the whole delivery (C section) so he says  he was a bit shakey there a time or two.  Here are some digital camera pics I took when "N.

In the past, I have directed the implementation of  several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the  Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my  observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of  data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to  get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with  this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this  month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for  data quality and timeliness.  The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial  teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the  requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity  driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of  day Friday, June 2.  Please note the following updates: For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the  survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please  provide statistics accordingly If a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email  Jennifer Reside If you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction,  please call or email Jennifer Reside  If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the  surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.  This will  eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like  us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next  month, please let Jennifer know.

farmer-d	 If you guys remeber, I reminded you all last Tuesday, 5/30, in our staff  meeting to be on the look-out for the attached message from James re: 5/00  hours.  The deadline was Friday, 6/2, and unfortunately, very few of you  responded.  I understand how busy each of you are and you have expressed your  concerns on the process burdening you.  However, there are pressures  internally to provide information to Sr. Management on a more timely basis.   We need to do our part.  Please respond ASAP, but no later than Thursday,  6/8.  Please contact Jennifer or Shari if you have any questions or need any  help.  Additionally, for those of you who are involved in Bridgeline, we will be  preparing a bid for our services going forward per a discussion I had with  Trevor yesterday.  Therefore, the May drivers are very critical to that  process also.  So everyone, please get your info in ASAP.

I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself  to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll  in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka  Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of  several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the  Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my  observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of  data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to  get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with  this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this  month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for  data quality and timeliness.  While completing the survey, take this time to review last month's numbers.  Please return these surveys to Shari Mao by end of day Friday, June 2.    Please note the following changes: The Nat Gas RC's will now see deal validation and transportation rate  activities therefore, these surveys will be notably longer but will not  necessarily take more time  If the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on,  PLEASE DO NOT TYPE ANY ACTIVITIES IN THE SURVEY.  Contact Jennifer Reside at  #35971 to discuss how to proceed.  If you have any questions relating to the model or this survey, or are unable  to meet the survey due date, please call Jennifer Reside at #35971 (Shari is  on vacation this week).

We do not have access to their contracts to do  the noms.  CES use to have Transco do it for them and so did we for January  and February, but nothing was nominated for March or April.  I mentioned this to Nelson and Dan Junek back in March, but nothing was  decided.  At one time, Devon did not want to give us access to nominate their PVR because they did not want us to have access to any of their  information.  Could you find out if we are responsible for the PVR and if we  are, they have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts?  Maybe you  will have better luck than I did.

farmer-d	 To clarify the discussion below:  I will not be discussing the promotion  candidates with Sally prior to her PRC meeting on 6/19/00.  As a reminder, our PRC meeting will be held on Tuesday, 6/13 in EB37C1,  beginning @ 12:00 Noon.  Lunch will be served, and Yvette has drinks and  snacks throughout the day.  Our goal will be NOT to have dinner, but if  necessary, we will.  I suggest each of you to make arrangements to stay as  late as needed to ensure we reach a quality work product.  Our agenda:  Review of ground rules and responsibilities of the committee.  Each of you will provide a general business assessment of your team.  HR  challenges should be identified along with needed skill sets, gap analysis  and succession planning.  The template below should be used for the format.   I am not interested in discussing the business goals, but you probably need  to think through these in order to discuss the assessments that we will want  to discuss as a group.  Review and discussion of exempt employees.  Each will be categorized into the  six descriptors used in the feedback process.  I am expecting each of you to  have a listing of accomplishments from your employees along with factual  feedback and observations which will allow you to place your employees into  appropriate categories.  I would like to stress that the data to sustantiate  the performance descriptor should be factual and documented.  The focus of  employee discussions must be on each employee's individual contribution  towards accomplishing our business goals.  We must safeguard our discussions  from "he said, she said" periferal distractors, and focus on the work product.  Promotion candidates discussion.  Once again, the PRC process is a valued process at Enron.  Each of you have  been through it, so you understand the importance of confidentiality.   Additionally, the Committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote.   Please come to the meeting with your "Enron" hat on - not your individual  group hat.  Our people are critical to our business.  Therefore, it is  important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff.  We must identify  our stengths and weaknesses, and work towards strengthening our people to  ensure the very best business service we can provide.  What this means is  that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback  possible.  In some cases, you may be providing a tough message, but it is our  responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands  expectations, where they are on point and where they are NOT on point of  meeting these expectations so that they can have the next six months to build  needed skill sets and/or correct behaviors.  This is your obligation as their  immediate supervisor.   If you have any questions, concerns or issues you  would like to talk about prior to the meeting on Tuesday, please contact me  or Hector.  In advance, I appreciate your time, energy and professionalism in this  process. ---------------------- Forwarded by Brenda F Herod/HOU/ECT on 06/09/2000  10:56 AM ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp.

Our notes indicate that this would be the general rule of  thumb.  I thought the Promotion discussion would be an agenda item of PRC.   We believe that discussion of promotions will also occur at the PRC.    Additionally, I understood the Mid-Year promotion listing would not be as  extensive as year-end, maintaining the year-end as the primary promotion  time. We understood the same.

farmer-d	 With SAP now here there are going to be a few minor changes that we will all  have to make immediately.   First: Everyone will have to make Internet Explorer their Default Browser.  If  you're not sure how to do this give me a call and I will help.  The reason  for this is that our new TimeSheet Program will only run through Internet  Explorer.  Second:  Sometime next week we will have a brown bag lunch where I will walk you  through entering your time in this New System.  It's not time consuming just  different.  Third: Next  Thursday you will be e-mailed an SAP log-on ID and Password.  Please  don't delete or disregard the importance of this e-mail.  You will need it to  key your time.  Fourth: All company and RC #'s are changing.  The company part is easy. It will be 4  digits so if your company number is currently 413 it will now be 0413 or if  it is 012 it will now be 0012. Easy.  RC #'s are now called Cost Centers and  they are changing completely.  Please write these down somewhere you will  need them just like you need to know your RC.  RC 1497 = CC 105633  RC 1638 = CC 105634 RC 2664 = CC 105630 RC 2933 = CC 106292 RC 0688 = CC 105631 RC 1160  = CC 105632 RC 2675 =  CC 105638 RC 2939 = CC 106269 RC 2940 = CC 106290 RC 2663 = CC 105629  The transition shouldn't be too painful for you but it promises to be a  little stressful for your assistants so please bear with us and cooperate.

We have seen very positive results from our initial tests and  would like to proceed with a "stress test" (not to be confused with me  showing up each day at work).  We would like to do 2 tests next week due to  hardware and business restrictions.  The test would be similar to those from late-1998 (ah, those were the  days!).  We will ask all users, as well as I.T. folks, to run as many of  their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1:30pm  on Tuesday and Wednesday. Be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for  your staff!  The Sybase 12.0 environment can be accessed via Start/Programs/Test  Applications/Unify Applications/Unify Gas-Power Stage.  On the Login window,  select server = "ASE 12 Test".  If you usual Production password does not  work, try "houston".  If that does not work, try a neighbor's (Audit says  that fine, its just a test).  Each user should plan to run several sessions  where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for  those not able to participate during this time.  Please have your staff try  to login some time Monday to insure they have access.  The test script during the time period will be: 12:00 - 1:30 Logistics:  pathing, nominating, running some reports 12:20 - 1:30 Volume Management: do your thing 12:40 - 1:30 Settlements/Accounting:  pile in  Please let me know if your area would NOT be able to assist in this very  important test.  The results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should  pursue our migration to this new release in mid-July.  The less bid weeks  with poor system performance the better!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ----------------------- Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion. In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business." A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to come."  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition. Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high growth rates over the last two thousand years. Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A Week," and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts.

Just a helpful list of clothing items, sun skin care  suggestions, etc. list that they may want to pack.  An agenda will be coming  shortly after that.  As you all know each of your customers are responsible  for getting themselves to Florida.  If for some reason you have a  . . . . .  . high maintenance customer who is really pushing the issue of us helping  them find a flight we will help target some flights they can take.  They will  still be responsible for the  fare.  Please don't freely offer this  suggestion only use it as an emergency.  I do have the list of each of your customers who have RSVP'd. if you have any  customers who you are afraid may back out please let me know who they are so  that I can make a "Glad you're coming do you have any questions?" phone call  a few days before departure to ensure they are still coming.

farmer-d	 We need to discuss further.  My concern would be that how do we know what %  HPL should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our  fuel cost ?  Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance?  I think  that Pipeline Operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel  retainage.  But, if we retain fuel on ENA transports, then we need to come up  with a plan to nominate this in Marketing Operations to Houston Pipeline.   Currently, this process is not in place.

farmer-d	 Application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts  doesn't have to be done by zone or compressor, in fact I am sure there will  be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to  the pipelines total usage.  Usually, short.  I just do not think the market  will let me lay off ALL of this risk.  It would be really nice if we could  get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts  but I am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue.  Fuel should not  cause imbalances on the transportation contract.  A pipeline could be long  fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject  or hold in linepack the excess.  It seems that we would look at fuel on a  total basis.

farmer-d	 I will be taking a sabbatical beginning any moment.  I have no control over  the exact time; it may have already happened.  I plan to visit the mountains  and the ocean.  They miss me. I miss them.    Unfortunately, Enron requires employees to use vacation time instead of Inner  Self time, so I will have to return someday.  Looks like July 5th.  I'm kind  of bummed about it, but maybe by then I will have transcended to a new  plateau of understanding.  In my absence, contact Milind Patil, x39247 for Unify performance issues.

farmer-d	 There have been so many CILCO issues until I'm not sure which one you are  referencing.  If it relates to the CILCO sale that has created the large  receivable balance, then we are waiting on a response from Daren.  I met with  Daren and Kenny and we all agree that the sale between ENA-TX and CILCO is  invalid and that the sale has to be with the storage book (your group will  not have to do anything with this sale).  The problem lies in the associated  transport with that sale.  This is the piece that we need Daren's help on.  I  will touch base with Daren and see if we can get this resolved this week.  If  this is not what you are referring to, please let me know.  Thanks!       	Enron North America Corp.

Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and= =20 Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid= ed=20 to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.  On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for= =20 calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  = It is=20 expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,= =20 effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib= le=20 on that date (please see note below).

farmer-d	 Introducing your first SAP Paycheck!  This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of=20 Corporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is=20 reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below.  What=01,s Different? ? Your =01+home=01, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay adv= ice.=20 This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial module= s=20 of SAP.  ? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P=01, represent earning t= ypes=20 reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time f= or=20 the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay=20 advice as =01+PVacation=01,.  ? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instea= d=20 of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions wil= l=20 remain itemized in the deduction section.  ? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-= date=20 totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the=20 year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This= =20 change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your= =20 pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year= =20 will reflect your earnings by company).  ? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick= =20 day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the= =20 related dollar amount will be included in the =01+Salary=01, earnings type.= =20  ? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll= =20 contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555    Payroll FAQ=01,s  My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stan= d for? There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For= =20 some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to=20 print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions an= d=20 prints them on one line =01) titled =01&other deductions=018.  The detail o= f all=20 deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intrane= t=20 at eHRonline.enron.com.  What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean? These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at=20 hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.  Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck? Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected = in=20 the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the=20 July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay ad= vice=20 as =01+POvertime=01,.  What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)? For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit = is=20 applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to=20 another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amou= nt=20 withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FIC= A=20 will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.  What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock= =20 options? There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This= =20 can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form=20 requesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , selec= t=20 Enron Payroll  from the side index). 
farmer-d	 We are going to add a new drop down flag to STORAGE in SITARA to  differentiate the difference between physical and synthetic storage - as each  are treated differently for inventory accounting purposes.   A change will also  be made to Global Contracts and UNIFY, and is intended to assist with OA  variances on STORAGE.  On the next release (mid August) we will add a drop down on the STORAGE deal  type which will be a required field. Someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be  a required field - physical facility or synthetic.  (We can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be  converted - as well as results for Global conversion)  Global Contracts uses the flags from SITARA to set up new contracts - so  SITARA will add the flag on the deal.  The flag will be stored in Global Contracts - which will feed the flag to  UNIFY.  Once the existing deals are converted in SITARA, Global Contracts can add the  appropriate flag to their system. Once this is complete and UNIFY is ready, UNIFY can begin to feed in the  information from Global Contracts, and we will then  be able to differentiate the two in the accounting system.  In the interim time, you may want to identify your synthetic vs. physical  storage deals.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Team,  As I mentioned in our HPL staff meeting we are investigating the merits of  entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will  position HPL to effectively compete in the Texas intrastate market.  Our  primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and  achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate  pipelines. I would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the  optimal course of action for HPL and for Enron.   The skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our  Upstream Origination business in N. America, as well as to the ongoing  operation of HPL.  Our origination strategy is to leverage our business  operations, field operations, engineering, producer services, and marketing  skills to capture value from transportation, gathering, storage and commodity  opportunities on the gas/power grids.   We need our current employees to  accomplish this objective across N. America.  We have proven our ability to add value to Enron by developing the  Powder/Wind River pipelines, installing electric compressors, contracting for  processing capacity, and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the  Gulf Coast.  Our recent efforts to provide services such as business  operations, measurement, trading/marketing, and accounting services to third  party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity.  It is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our  competitive position in the market place that we DO NOT discuss HPL related  matters with third parties.  Please come see me if you have any specific  questions or concerns.  Also please refer any third party inquiries regarding  HPL to Tim Determing.  Regards, Brian

farmer-d	 Introduction  In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have  upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we  hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your  products.  This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days.  Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade.  Summary of New Features  Multiple Children - A "Child" product can be the "Parent" of another Child  (multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed  against a single Parent.  Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and  hit the "+" or "-" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount  in Product Properties until you logout.  Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on  the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your "shift" key.  Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis  relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: "Basis  Link - Parent" and now would say "Stand Alone, Parent").   Detailed Feature Descriptions   Multiple Children  The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together  in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product  B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C.  Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a  chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a  customer attempts a transaction, the database must "lock" each and every  product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The  database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the  locks. "Vertical" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are  much slower to process than "Flat" chains (One parent with many children).  Large vertical chains should be avoided.   Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the  same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent  Product B. At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link  to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated  Basis link and a regular Basis Link.   Static Product Bar Prices  The new version of EnronOnline provides for "sticky" Product Bar price and  volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not  reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you  have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or  offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "+" or "-" buttons.   One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it  reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if  the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price  movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the  website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder  for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update  moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering  an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price  movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary,  improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure  rate.  You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field  for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products  which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu.   Sorting/Selecting  The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting  functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type,  Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple  sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then  Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first  by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in  alphabetical order).  If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort  criteria, plus you can select "Sort by Web Order", which allows you to see  your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the  website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a  number of products in addition to the ones you are managing).  When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left  mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while  making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not  necessarily adjacent to one another.   Parent Products and F/X Products  One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its  treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the  type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of  the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version  does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for  more than one type of link on each parent product.  Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now  identified with a stylised "fx" in the Product list. This is to enable easy  identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the  parent, rather than managed individually.    Assistance  As always, if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality,  please contact the 24 hour Help Desk (Houston: 713 853 4357, London: +44 (0)  20 7783 7783, Australia: +61 2 9229 2300).   General Feedback  If you have any comments on the new functionality, or suggestions for further  functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had  previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this  release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard  to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your  requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager.

The total volume was still correct.  I just found out today, from Stacie,  that a buy on EOL needs to be on the header and come from a PGEV Hub or Title  Tracking Agreement.   I had previously been under the impression that  whatever pipeline the customer wanted, buy or sell, was fine with us.   However, keeping the purchases on Hub Agmts. will save Enron  $.0025/transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier.  Mary 
farmer-d	 Darren:  I zeroed the path on deal 284599, and left 4,500 pathed on 339604 at meter  4132, and pathed 5,000 for both deals 341801 & 341808 at meter 67 for 7/24  only.  I also notified Betsy Boring/Southern about the situation and  explained to her that any deal they make on EOL cannot be changed in any way,  however we would move the gas for the 24th only because we ok'd the change  before we realized it was an EOL deal.

I am a little  concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that  these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.   (Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It  would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.  Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running  again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and  schedulers on call.  Let me know what you think.  D

If you are  planning to spend the night, you do not need to respond to that option.  It  is listed only for those who do not plan to spend the night.     We are preparing name tags for all the employees invited to the HPL  Anniversary Celebration.  Please email me with the name you would like to  appear on your nametag, such as nicknames, etc.   If we do not hear from you  by Wednesday, August 2, we will use the name as it appears in the list we  acquired from HR.

farmer-d	  Deal 138049 is committed reserve long term gas totaling 1,350mm per day  which is a good deal.    However, deal #:  348446 is a  duplicate deal which was overstated and  should be zeroed out {bad deal}.    This is Vance response to an inquiry made by Bob.    Daren, do you want me to zero out  deal #: 348446 ?                 
farmer-d	 FYI -   It apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12/99 -  04/02/00, were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase.   Therefore, Vance explained to me that the volume of 1,517 Dth for the period  should have been allocated to the Strangers agreement, just as it was.   Any  deliveries were unauthorized (UDOG) and the gas then belongs to HPL.  Please  give Vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue.  Thank you all for your patience and assistance.  I appreciate it!  Mary Jane

farmer-d	 We are in the midst of enhancing the Operations Pricing Model (fka  Transaction Costing Model) and as a result the following applies:   - Do not need the hours surveys completed for July or August  - Need the activity driver surveys completed for July and August   Attached is the activity driver survey for the month of July.   Please fill  out the attached activity driver survey with July numbers for your RC and  return to Shari Mao by end of day Friday, August 11.  During the enhancment period (July and August) we will be standardizing and  consolidating activities across all commodities and operational functions.   This will result in a shorter survey and easier time assignment to activities  for your teams.  The shorter and easier surveying process will begin with the  September survey.  Please call either me or Shari Mao at 39641 or 33859, respectively for any  clarification.  Thanks for your patience and help,  James Scribner

farmer-d	  Conoco has nominated 5.0/d at this meter.  Conoco transport can be allocated  the entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow  exceed 5.0mm because they are the only party doing business at the meter.    HPL may also be able to extract a sell for this overage which is why  I  wanted you to be aware of the daily activity thus far.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Robert E Lloyd/HOU/ECT on 08/21/2000  01:57 PM --------------------------- From: Lee L Papayoti on 08/21/2000 01:44 PM To: Robert E Lloyd/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sherlyn Schumack/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anita Luong/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daren J  Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gary A Hanks/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pat Clynes/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Re: Meter #: 1266 ; August 2000 / Allocation Exception    why are these volumes flowing?

farmer-d	 Should these not be converted to ENA - IM Texas ???  Some time ago - we were  told this desk was dead and the existing deals would end.  This desk is not  included in any Texas desk portfolios.  The ECT desks are supposed to be inactive - however - these deals keep  rolling - and  someone created some new ones?   If the desk is active - should we change it  to ENA - IM Waha -  as ECT is no more ???

Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where  10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was  invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error  report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is  not valid for the deal?  When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day  that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).    Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated  to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be  added to the deal.

Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where  10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was  invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error  report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is  not valid for the deal?  When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day  that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).    Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated  to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be  added to the deal.

It would be incorrect to add  any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was  allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in  MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.  D ---------------------- Forwarded by Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT on 08/23/2000  12:54 PM ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp.

Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where  10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was  invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error  report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is  not valid for the deal?  When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day  that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).    Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated  to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be  added to the deal.     
farmer-d	 Robert, You can communicate by lotus notes, phone, memo or other means.  The point  that I am making is to communicate all and any industrial information to Daren, Gary Hanks, volume management,  and myself.  There may be times to also involve Lee and Gary as well as others.  This was just to assist you.

The  customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned  turnaround.  It is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation  resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown.

farmer-d	 Daren, there were several points on your list that were previously created  and the remainder have been created, with the exception explained below.  Donna and I researched your list and identified the ones that were on system  (which she would create) and the ones that were off system (which I would  create).  Standard Pooling Stations and West Texas (Line X) Pooling Stations had no  meters, so they are not set up.    The Hunt Fairway Plant (17-8477-01) was previously created as (178477), I  need to know if the (01) needs to be added.  We need to verify HPL - Texoma (17-0973-13), it is set up as (17097613).  Is  this the same point???  Please let Donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red.   Thanks, Faye

farmer-d	 Daren - can you get a deal set up for meter 1459 for 8/00?  The last deal  number associated with this meter is 331917 for July 00. Counterparty - GSF  Energy, LLC. Let me know if you have any questions.  AL 
farmer-d	 10,000 should be allocated to Adonis #51862 on the 5th only.  Nothing should  be allocated or confirmed for Adonis on the 16th.  Additionally, it looks  like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from Mitchell (Track ID 3167) on the  16th.  This should be -0- also.  By taking the conf/allocation for Adonis  (Track ID 6155) and Mitchell (Track ID 3167) to zero on the 16th, the meter  balance remains the same and the bridge errors will be cleared.

Let me know what you find in MOPS.  D ---------------------- Forwarded by Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT on 08/23/2000  12:54 PM ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp.

Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where  10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was  invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error  report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is  not valid for the deal?  When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day  that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).    Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated  to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be  added to the deal.

farmer-d	 Ed - can you help?  I need to know the term of our existing transport expense  deal with Reliant Entex to serve the referenced customer.  We must have an  existing contract that we can look up.  Our existing deal to sell to Mobil  expires October 1.  I am trying to make a two year sales offer beginning  October 1.  If the transport expires before then, then we'll need to call  Entex about a transport rate.  Who is the correct dealmaker to call Entex on  this matter??  I'd be happy to do it, but I'd be stepping on somebody else's  turf.  If the existing rate is indeed 5 cents plus 2.02% fuel, that seems kind of  high.  It's a short haul -  according to our field folk, we give the gas to  Entex at the La Porte City Gate, and it goes to the Mobil plant at Pasadena,  about 10 miles away at the most.  Any and all help appreciated.  Lee         	Enron North America Corp.

The system is  scheduled to open for feedback in 35 days.   Please forward all mid-year 2000  evaluations to Janet De La Paz at EB3658a.

Tell them the information they forward to you  will better help you in representing them.    The focus of the PRC this year will remain on development of the employee and  will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to  everyone else in their peer group.   Update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key  highlights of their performance or lack thereof  now with your direct reports  so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your  direct report.   It is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session  with your direct report if he/she already knows what the key areas of needed  development are.   An ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which  employees with performance issues (can't do or won't do) choose to exit the  group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given.   I will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available.   Let me know if you have any questions.  hgm

farmer-d	 Duke will be paid 9/22 for  May 2000 through July 2000.  We should have the  August 2000 invoice by the end of next week. Megan Parker is handling this  deal going forward and has contacted Duke to request an invoice for August.   Megan was not receiving invoices, and since it is our policy to withhold  payment unless we are invoiced, payment was not made on this until now.

farmer-d	 Daren--  I know you're busy with bid week, so here are a couple questions & comments  for you:  September I need to know if a ticket has been set up for September for the market side  of the Williams & Apache gas.  We still only the supply is in MOPS.  If it  just needs points added to it, just let me know the deal ticket #.  August 31st This was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on  Lonestar  1023 & 1460.  Currently, they do not have the supply points needed  for the Williams & Apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to  imbalance...so I will get them added so this gas can be pathed.    July 31 - Aug 7 These days were pathed as buy/sells from Tenaska IV to Tenaska Marketing  Ventures.  I worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment (July &  Aug business), and had them do a manual entry for Aug 31st.   Please let me know what you think when you get a chance.   Thanks, Mark x33396

All the above is in Sitara 415267  Thanks  Lee

Please review the letters  and get back to me on the following items:  Person to send the letters to at the respective companies Fax #'s to fax it to on Friday Name and adress of ENA person to direct inquiries to Name and phone number of person to direct questions re: the notification  letter People at Tenaska to copy and their address and fax #'s Comments on substance of the letter (please review carefully my reference to  what ENA is acting as agent for--it is specific as to noms, scheduling and  billing, not a general agency for all things under the contract--is that  correct?)   If you don't mind, please forward any email response to Bob Walker and leave  me a voicemail. I will be out of the office Friday, but checking voicemail  and coordianting with Bob to get these out.    Also, once we send these letters out, we should be prepared for each of these  entities to ask to see the agency agreement. They may, in fact, not be  comfortable dealing with ENA with just this letter.

farmer-d	 Here is this upcoming week's discussion  material!? ? Bobby  - NEON Measuring Success Lesson 3.doc 
farmer-d	 Imbalances:  I would like us to continue to pursue Channel/ El Paso/ Tenngasco for our  payback.  They got our cashout number last week, where do they stand.   Again,  I think Robert is an ally and I do not want to irritate him but  things will not get any better in the future.  We need to resolve this  imbalance.  Can we net some  of these contracts? I like Mary Poorman's report; however I have questions:  How can we miss black marlin so completely?  do we agree with this imbalance?  Can we net all the Chevron and Dynegi contracts together for payback to  Keith once we get the AR issue solved?  Where do we stand on the Columbia Energy resolution?  Where do we stand on the NGPL reconcilliation?  Duke Energy 206 is still a problem.  Do we need all these Amoco contracts they have 8, that seems like a large  number to me, can we net some of them?  Are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the Entex  contract?  Is there a way to keep Tejas in line at Southern Union this winter?  That  meter will really swing then and I do not know how much line pack they have  the  right to use.  Can we net the Corpus Christi gas marketing and all the Tejas/ Coral/Gulf  Energy/Shell imbalances down?  How is the reconcillitation going?  Can we smash the Entex and the Reliant contracts together so we can get rid  of some of these contracts?  They have 9, that seems like a lot to me.  Gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this  contract, it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some   where we are owed?  Is this Lone Star 213 imbalance real, if so how do we resolve?  Where did the Exxon imbalance come from?  Do we need 5 Texaco transportation contracts, can we get rid of some?  Can we combine the Vastar and the Southern imbalances?  What is the Webb/Duval do, can we get rid of it, combine this with Midcon,  how old is this imbalnce?  Mick update the compressor fuel on the P/L but the new numbers do not seem to  translate up to the profit calculation?  Can we do something about this? I thought the imbalance report I got this Wed was pretty sad.  Some of the  columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information.  Can  we resolve this? I am concerned about our capacity positons in the future, we are going to  have to work on a better way to check our positions. I had a meeting with Tom Shelton and our representative to the RRC, James  Mann, the RRC is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to  compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with  the RRC several years ago.  Lauri will have a copy of the priority list.  We  need to compile this list and get Tom and James comfortable with the  process.  The last thing we need is the RRC hammering on us, when can we get  this list?  I think we should be able to get something out of the contract  system.  Jackie Morgan is who I would approach.

It includes a place for your FTE's, hours by position & activity  and the activity definitions for your cost center.  Please let me know if you  have any questions.  Thanks, Suzanne     
farmer-d	 Daren, There are five HPLC purchase deals for 09/99 from Ocean Energy Inc.   They were Craig Falbaum's deals.  A person who is no longer in my group  suspended payment for these deals.  Gary suggested that I contact you and see  if you have any insight as to why the deals might have been suspended, or  know anything that might help.  Thanks. 
farmer-d	 Currently,  prior month deals are inactivated in Sitara for portfolio  purposes on the 10th of the month.     For system efficiencies we would like to inactivate September deals this  weekend if possible.   This will have no affect on volume feedback.   A system enhancement is being worked on so that we would not have to try to  inactivate earlier than normal for next month.  Please contact me if this timing would cause you any problems.  Thank you  Russ x37386

farmer-d	 We did take into account the price adjustments you made.  The actual purchase  cashout for 8/00 was $118,103.67.  Your pricing took care of most of the  cashout, but there was still a balance.  The over delivery pricing per MMBtu  in the contract is the difference between HSC Spot - 0.05 and HSC Index, so  GD - 0.10 didn't quite cover the entire cashout.  I have attached the calc  sheet in case you need it.    Megan

farmer-d	 I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters  LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My  former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these  south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed  a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract  area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so  she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but  she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for  the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to  these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for  paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

farmer-d	 Daren: I am having trouble with 8/00.  The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at  Fuels Cotton.  We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange  deal 157288.  You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had  occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing.  Since there was a  spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951.  Duke says that  day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at  GD - 0.10.  The exchange deal is currently price at index - 0.05.  Please let  me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be.   The second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8/00.  Duke is telling  me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are  suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange.  This  is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5th and 6th and pipeline  shows all of the gas on the 7th.  This is a daily swing meter which  electronically feeds into settlements.  We don't normally change these  meters.  If you intended for us to prorate this gas, I will need your OK. The  emails below are from Marta at Duke notifying us of the change.

I either talked or left a message with someone in the  settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the  trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard  back from anyone.   This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this  year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can  change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets)  today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.

farmer-d	 Tina, Koch never returned my calls. Based on the contractual information, we may be  putting ourselves in a risk area by 'assigning' the deals without proper  documentation. The documentation that was supplied did not refence any ENA  agreements, nor any specific meter numbers. If the purchase was indeed a  meter/well sale; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired  and the effective date. Since we are apparently the supplier, the risk is not  as substaintial as if we were the purchaser. However, without documentation  we are basically relying on the relationship btw Koch & Duke.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I  wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the  settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the  trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard  back from anyone.   This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this  year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can  change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets)  today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You  will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct  contract in place for the deal.

My  former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these  south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed  a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract  area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so  she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but  she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for  the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to  these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for  paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

farmer-d	 Daren---  I need some help with meter 5892 for September 00 due to a feedback error.   Deal 133196 (purchase from Duke on gathering contract) is erroring out due to  it's expiration date of 8/31/00......however it still showed up in POPS (w/o  a nom) on 9/1.  Volume management allocated volume to it according to the  allocation statement.  Should this deal be extended?  I noticed it is not out  there for October either.  I have the feedback error sheet & allocation if  you want to see them.  Let me know,  Mark x33396   p.s. Fred Boas said you used to handle this and you were very wise in the art  of allocation......so I am expecting big results Grasshopper! 
farmer-d	 Tenaska IV has been operating without a "gas agency agreement" since that  portion of the Transition Agreement expired on August 31.

farmer-d	 Fred,  Now that Daren has the purchase in, I have added August to the Deal Ticket   386540 which is the Desk to Desk at the meter (4584 on Humble P/L, pathed as  a Buy/Sell), and to Deal Ticket 386269 which is the Transport Usage ticket  (from 4584 to meter 12 at the plant inlet, pathed on Humble contract 401).   Please set up the appropriate track id's.  Since this is OffSystem, that  should take care of the August issue.  Mary

farmer-d	 Fred:  I have run this issue by Clem Cernosek for further research, and expect to  have his answer this afternoon.  In the meantime, it is my understanding that  this well is behind the Big Cowboy system.  At this time, we have deal ticket  380710, purchase from CCGM, L.P. on HPLC/HPLC.   This deal should probably be  on Gulf Energy/BigCowboy.  The producer, as I understand it, is Acock  Production, however, I may be mis-informed.  Any insight which any of you can  shed on this deal would be very welcome, I would like to capture this  accurately and definitively as early on as possible, so as to prevent any  future issues.  Thank you all for your patience and assistance,  Mary   
farmer-d	 Aimee:  The volumes that we determined to be written off at this meter need to go  into MOPS.  Please get a copy of a formal letter that Clem has prepared for  other write-off's and send to Daren Farmer for approval .  Get Daren to put  the proper deal tickets in MOPS and then let me know how to path this gas.  I  will then set up accounting arrangements and get these volumes in the  System.  the months in question are November and December of 1999, February  2000, and June 2000.  Do you think that we can get this accomplished by October 31, 2000?  If not,  please let me know a date when you think that we can get this resolved.  Thanks,  Fred 
farmer-d	 Vance,  Thank you for the information.  That explains the deal.  What we need now, to  correctly book these volumes and clear any current issues in Volume  Management and/or settlements which would date back to the inception of the  deal.  This will also ensure that your book is correct for this deal.  I  think that Bob Cotten is the one to correct/add the deal, and then Tom Acton  and myself will need to make requests of Volume Mgmt. to kick-off the  re-booking process.  Thank you for your time,  Mary  ext. 35251

farmer-d	 Mary,  HPLC currently has a gas purchase agreement (global #96014987) in place with  Calpine that extends through 5/31/2001.  Sitara deal no. 133259 correctly has  this contract attached to it.  Effective 11/1/1998 the contract was amended  releasing Gouger wells no. 5 & 6.  These wells were apparently the only  producing wells behind this point.  Evidence being no measured volumes in  MIPS.  There are however other non producing wells behind this point.  Is  your Sept & Oct UA4 issue the direct result of volumes being scheduled at  meter no. 4229?  If so, for November, the nom at this point will be taken to  1mmbtu/d until the wells behind this point began to produce.  As far as meter 6835 (Roos #1 C/P) is concerned, HPLC also has a contract  (#96003771) in place with Cokinos Nat Gas that is currently in an "evergreen"  status.  The aforementioned wells were released from the Calpine contract;  however, they were not added behind meter 6835.  Therefore, I do not agree  that the deal (133259) should be edited to change the meter.  Hopefully this information is useful!  vlt x3-6353     Mary Poorman@ENRON 10/23/2000 02:06 PM To: Katherine Benedict/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vance L  Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pat Clynes/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc:   Subject: Meter 984229 - Roos Common Point - Trade Zone 18  I am not sure who should handle this, so, I shared the "wealth".

farmer-d	 Per our various discussions, I am sending an email to reiterate the  disposition of volumes at Meter 9862, the Lehman Spinaker pay meter.  At this  time, the General Land Office is transporting their share of production  (21.8945%  interest) and HPL is purchasing the remaining 78.1055%.    The GLO has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848, effective September  1, 2000.  During this time, some test gas flowed.  I have had the HPL  purchase back-dated to coincide with the transport nomination, and have had  both deals moved to 9862.  The meter should probably be designated a  Callout/Swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after  the production month by Volume Management.  For October production forward, I am going to re-rank/confirm the pay meter  to ensure that the GLO receives a volume which should be close to their  percentage after actuals close for the month.  This should alleviate any  large balance swings on their agreement.  Anita:  For September, I need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket  379424; HPL gathering agmt. at meter 9862.  Please unallocate the transport  and purchase at 9848.  The meter is a daily swing right now.  Let me know  when you are ready and I will change the allocation methodology.  I apologize for the length of this email, I want to make sure that we are all  on the same page, to the extent that we need to be, prior to this deal  getting too far down the road.  Please do not hesitate to call me if you have  any questions, comments, concerns, etc.  I am at extension 35251.  Thank you all for your time and patience,  Mary 
farmer-d	 Here's material for this upcoming  week. ? Bobby  - NEON Roaring 3.doc 
farmer-d	 I checked the meter for September, there are measured volumes of 36,085 Dth  for the month.  The meter had a purchase from MJG at the beginning of the  month.  It looks like it was zeroed after the fact.  We are going to need to  pay someone for  this production....I think we may need to extend the deal  until the point at which the meter was actually shut-in.  I do not agree with  allocating this gas to Strangers, it is not a true line gain/loss, or a  direct result of any pipe/well work.  Please advise so that Anita and I can clean this up as promptly as possible.  Mary  x 35251 
farmer-d	 Mary,  HPLC meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in December,  1999.   Typically, before HPL physically pulls a meter, production has ceased  at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released.  In the case of  the Roos common point, the producing wells were released and attached to  meter 0989740 in 11/98 and the remaining wells are non-producing.   Resultingly, the only viable option for resolution is option 2.  We should  take the deal to zero by "unwinding" it.   vlt x3-6353      Mary Poorman@ENRON 10/24/2000 12:40 PM To: Vance L Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Katherine Benedict/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daren J  Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pat Clynes/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robert Cotten/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Meter 984229 - Roos Common Point - Trade Zone 18    Vance:  Per our conversation, we have two possible options to resolve this deal,  depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not.  Producing:  If that is the case, the purchase from Calpine, and any contracts  hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level.   Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads  were allocated and paid and reallocate to your Calpine deal.  This will  probably have to go back to HPLC's ownership of HPLR's gathering assets.  Non-producing:  Should we determine that the Common Point and any wells  behind it have been shut-in, or P&A'd, we will need to reallocate this deal  to zero, and unwind any hedges against it (or, move the hedges to another  deal, if possible.  Since the deal is older, we probably sold lower priced  contracts against the production and a buy-back today would possibly result  in a financial loss).    In either case, the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow  at meter 4229, which I am currently looking into.  I will email you as soon  as I ascertain that date.  In lieu of the past couple of days, we may need to look at all of the deals  which were impacted by HPLC's aquisition of HPLR's gathering to ensure that  they are being captured properly, both at a book level and at a state filing  level.  Please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish  this.  Thank you again for all of your hard work in this area,    Mary

farmer-d	 Having discussed the matter with Brian Riley, HPL has no intention of  contacting Coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received  in September at at Meter 4179.

However, I don't feel  that we can confiscate their production.  We need to either pay them for the  gas, or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter.   Given the decrease in prices from September to current and prompt month, I  would guess that they want to be paid.  We won't know that until we call  them.  I don't know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to  explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was  shut-in.    Please let me know if I can do anything further to assist.  Mary

farmer-d	 I need HPL Sales and Purchases, back dated to 8/99 between HPL and TECO to  book any processing revenue or losses.  Apparently this is in addition to the  current deal in place and is priced at at different rate.  Please let me know  when these tickets are in place so that I can get track id's and finalize  this issue.  Thank you,  Mary 
farmer-d	 This deal is to book the Teco PVR revenue.  It is my understanding that Teco  just sends us a check, I haven't received an answer as to whether there is a  predermined price associated with this deal or if Teco just lets us know what  we are giving.  I can continue to chase this deal down if you need.

The Fuels Cotton Valley gas will not be priced per the Transaction Agreement for 11/15/00 - 11/30/00.  This gas will be sold to HPL at $5.60/MMBtu in a separate gas purchase agreement. 
farmer-d	 Ladies and Gents:  On Sat Oct 21, HPL meter # 1428 had a malfunction, and started flowing at a  very high rate, way over the nominated rate of 18,000/d  (Gas Control will  confirm this).  Since Sat-Sun-Mon are all one gas day from a Gas Daily perspective, I told  Gas Control to try to balance on Sun after the meter was fixed, by cutting  back to a lower flow rate.  So we will need to do a special allocation for the three days October 21 -  23, Saturday through Monday.  The three day total for the meter is 59,067  MMBtu.  Beaumont Methanol nominated 54,000 MMBtu (i.e. 18,000/d for 3  days).   We should allocate a total of 54,000 MMBtu to Beaumont Methanol for  the three days, and the 5,067 MMBtu excess will be purchased by Brandywine -  under Sitara # 484934 priced at Gas Daily HSC midpoint.

Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31.  "The end zones were confusing," says Slocum.  "I'm sure that some of the touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.  We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored thirty-five points.  There's no way we lost this one.  A&M demands a recount."  Oklahoma officials are calling this "outrageous".  "They agreed to the size, shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off," replies OU coach Bob Stoops.  "If they had a problem with them, they should have said so before we started.  You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points many times."  A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  "We are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of the game," says Slocum.  OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones were used.  "They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost," says Stoops.  Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing signs such as, "A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"  Students' thoughts echoed their signs.  "All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a winner," says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.  "We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner."  ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner, despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point.  At about 2:30 pm, with the game still too close to call, ABC had to back off its prediction.  College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call.  "We felt that with a number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were certain A&M would carry this game.  We may have been premature in our prediction."

farmer-d	 Imbalance update:  I spoke with Mike Bilberry and confirmed that this deal  really is Energy In/Energy Out.  We should not be impacted in any way by a  reallocation to correct PVR percentages or a C5 correction at the plant.    HPL/ENA should rereceive the same volume, Dth for Dth at the residue or at a  redelivery point such as Lobo/Agua.  I have left a message for my counterpart  at Duke and am requesting that they deliver to us, somewhere, an additional  20,125 Dth/Day for the month of December to balance us out.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I will advise  everyone upon their agreement to payback so that our respective positions  reflect the additional supply.  Mary

farmer-d	 This is a follow up to the conversation you had with Pat yesterday and to  reiterate retro contract assignments.  We have decided to go back to the old  process of handling contract assignments mid-month.  This means that if we  receive an assignment from legal after the 10th workday, that assignment will  become effective for current month the following month.  For example, if I  receive a notice from whomever that XYZ has been assigned to ABC on 11/15/00  for an legal effective date of 4/00, I will create a new deal from 4/00  forward.  On the new deal the currect month will be zeroed out under the  expected volumes.  Bob would not start nominating this new deal until 12/00,  leaving 4/00 - 11/00 to be moved by volume mangement.  If this is not a clear understanding from all parties, please let me know.  Rita:  If this becomes burdensome on your group, please let me know and we  will readdress this issue.  Thanks!!  Julie

farmer-d	 Daren- Deal # 421859 Sales Deal # 421847 Purchase  Settlements is showing both a sales and purchase for Texas General Land  Office and they are stating that they should not be billed or paid for  anything.  Are these deals suppose to be a washout and netted together?    If so, the volumes are not matching: the sales on HPL are 7,440 mmbtus on  deal #421859 and the purchase on MidTX is 6,629 mmbtus.  Let me know what type of deal this was intended to be.   FYI I was told that Tom Acton was handling this deal, but I believe he will be  out until after Thanksgiving. 
farmer-d	 Anita,   After speaking with Gary Lamphier, Big Thicket's allocation for  Pecos'/Roberson's portion will be done differently.  Historically, their  portion of the allocation was reduced for shrinkage.  Effective with October  00's allocation, shrink will no longer be deducted.  The full amount of  Pecos/Roberson's gas received at meter 6753 and delivered out at meter 8714  (Vastar) will be kept whole.  I spoke with your contact Harold McGee at Big  Thicket and he spoke with Pecos/Roberson regarding this and everyone is  agreement.  Your allocation process will be done the same, however the  Pecos/Roberson number on the allocation statement will no longer have  shrinkage deducted.  I have gone over the numbers for October with Harold and  he has stated the 23,174 is the amount that will be allocated to  Pecos/Roberson, 946 will go to Jay, and 9114 will be for Enron (this portion  has always been kept whole).  Can you please make sure that this is done.  If  there are any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

farmer-d	 Mary,  This is all the information that I have when Ami first looked at all the CES  information.  It does not mention a processing agreement, but that does not  mean that there isn't one.      Daren - do you know anything about a processing agreement for the Devon gas  at the Gulf Plains plant as it relates to the CES acquisition?

farmer-d	 Rita,   Since this is the case, I think we need to change the way we are booking this  deal.  Currently, the CES-Devon purchase is on 8348, which is a dummy inlet  to the plant.  Rather, we should probably just have the ENA purch at the  tailgate, 986363, with a D2D ticket that transfers ownership to HPL, if  necessary.  Please let me know what you think.  Mary

I spoke with the field guy today (Bobby Husky) and he stated that the well  would not be ready to turn on until 3 weeks from now.  He said that an amine  plant is being installed.  Therefore, we are waiting on them.  This is just  an FYI to everyone.    This will still be booked for December 2000.  Please  forward this email to anyone that I might have left out.  Thank you!

Because of the accrual, I cannot draft this today.  I  will try it on Monday.  What about the demand fee for the payable to Tenaska  IV.  Do you think that is a good idea?  I explained it to Kris Hanson and she  agreed that it was the best way to book this payable.  We would need a new  demand purchase ticket for Tenaska IV on the Cleburne desk in the amount of  $2,803,586.41 with no volume and no commodity.  This is more than we owe  Tenaska IV, but I will net it with the Tenaska IV sale and the $0.04 demand  fee to pay a net amount of $1,551,050.76.  I have attached my spreadsheet  which details our payment.  We will have to adjust this number once we get  the actual volumes.  I would like to pay Tenaska IV next week, so please let  me what you think.    Thanks, Megan

farmer-d	 Gerald/Eric-  I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract  012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various  Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to  Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport  contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether  the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then,  is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are  considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered  to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?  I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the  correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be  if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas  into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I  would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the  Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough  leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?  Thanks for your help.

Since Spinnaker was paid Gas Daily pricing for the month, there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when  the volumes are re-sent over on the actual day of flow.  In my calculations (using Gas Daily less $.21 as the price) we  are going to owe Spinnaker an additional $ 220,398.57.  One issue that needs to be addressed is this:  should the additional money go  directly to Spinnaker since they are allocating out October 2000 production payments to Ranger and Houston Exploration?    Attached is a spreadsheet showing where I came up with the extra money owed:    Thank you all!!  Christy 39050  PS This does not address the issue between the onshore and offshore meter,  this is just addressing the redistribution of volumes for the month of October.

farmer-d	 I am working on clearing an old TXU Lone Star/Gas Distribution balance from  8/99 and 9/99.  We originally billed TXU on nominated quantities and they  have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments.  These are brokered deals where  we sold to TXU and purchased from ExxonMobil and Highland.  TXU has provided  meter support since the deals were on Lone Star pipeline, however, I am  unsure how to have Volume Management reallocate.    For example, we originally sold 10,000 mmbtu on 8/3/99 to TXU and purchased  1,200 mmbtu from Highland Energy and 8,800 mmbtu from ExxonMobil.  TXU shows  the total amount of gas on 8/3/99 was 9,240 mmbtu.  How should the purchase  piece be allocated between ExxonMobil and Highland since this was a brokered  deal?  August 1999:  Sale TXU Electric & Gas  deals# 104975, 104256, 104738 Lone Star Gas Co. deal# 101985 Purchase ExxonMobil Corp. deal#101522 Highland Energy Co. deal#101530  September 1999:  Sale TXU Electric & Gas deal#109046 Purchase ExxonMobil Corp. deals#101522, 108564 Highland Energy Co. deals#101530, 108146   Please let me know if I need to speak with someone else about this.

The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is  45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a  problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up  with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1  only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I  think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the  purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73  booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to  net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James  is calling me every day asking for an update.

farmer-d	 Darren,  The demand fee is probably the best solution.  We can use it to create a  recieivable/payable with Tenaska, depending on which way the calculation goes  each month.  How are PMA's to be handled once the fee been calculated and the  deal put in the system?  Attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the GL for Cleburne as of  today.  Some of this info will change by the end of the month.  As you can  see, there are some discrepancies between Megan's calculations and what is on  the general ledger.  UA4 is also on my schedule.  Unless the buys/sells are  volumetrically balanced, we book an entry to balance the desk.  This will  change the calculation of what is due from/to Tenaska.  Should we be  recording a UA4 entry for Cleburne?  Is it addressed in the agreement with  Tenaska?

However, for October 2000, the plant was down the  majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing  money to Tenaska IV.  I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the  calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached  schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay  this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do  this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in  the future.  Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.  Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.   Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we  reimburse Tenaska IV.

The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is  45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a  problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up  with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1  only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I  think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the  purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73  booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to  net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James  is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be  able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can  see the numbers.       Megan

farmer-d	 Rita, Please help me with this. I have some questions regarding Enerfin. Why are we re-allocating prior month volumes at Enerfin after we matched your  original numbers back in October? Can't this be fixed in the actualization  process?   The numbers for October between ENA-TETCO and HPL vary a good bit.  Are we  your only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ENA had  no transactions with HPL?  Can we simply put zero paths in UNIFY and extend  our existing deals in Sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize  these small volumes to handle this?  We go round and round at this point  changing volumes two, three or more times. Call me if you have questions..

TETCO shows that the volumes that HPL was allocated on October 6th and  October 19th, were 9 dths and 44 dths, respectively.  Those volumes were  pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in  place.  This is the same problem that we have had over and over with them.   Also, we just found out on Tuesday, that the OBA did not go into effect until  December 1, 2000.  We were originally told that they were putting the OBA in  effect retroactively to November of 1999.  In fact, I thought that HPL had  made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the OBA, do you  remember that?  HPL told us that Ray Calles at TETCO is the one who decided  that the OBA would not be effective until December of 2000.  Nobody even  informed us of this change, I stumbled upon it when researching a November  issue for Alfonso Trabulsi and Brenda Fletcher.  In addition to all of this,  I received another email, which I will copy below, asking me to go in for the  month of October and adjust all of my estimated volumes in Unify to match  what HPL shows that we were allocated.  I had been going in all month long  and matching to their numbers, and we were clean for the deadline at the end  of the month.  I ran the allocation report from TETCO for the month of  October, and some of HPL's numbers were very different from TETCO's,  including the two days that I mentioned above.  I sent Jackie Young an email  back showing her TETCO's numbers and I haven't received a response.  I will  copy that email below as well, just to catch you up on what's been going on.

I copied your numbers below and  copied TETCO's volumes below that (with the disrepancies in red).  I was  wondering if you could double check the 3rd, 4th, 11th, 12th, 25th, and 27th  to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than  Enron North America at that meter.  It looks like maybe the volumes that you  show are the total flow at that meter, but I think that only part of the gas  was actually allocated to us.  I don't mind putting the allocated volumes in  path manager, but I'd like to make sure that on the above days, I am only  putting in the amount that Enron was allocated.     Also, on the 6th and the 19th TETCO shows exactly half of what you show,  which I thought was kind of strange.  I am going to have to get TETCO's  permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes  you have requested, before I can put anything in Sitara or Unify.  My manager  is out of the office and will be back tomorrow, but I would like for him to  double check the deal that we will have to create in Sitara for those two  days, since we are dealing with a prior month issue.

farmer-d	 I received a call from the plant, apparently, they shorted us 60 Dth on the  3rd of November.  However, someone opened the valve on the 20th and they  flowed 69 Dth into the pipe without a nomination.  The plant is asking if we  will phone Tennessee and accept allocation of this volume.  I realize that it  is really not alot of net difference volumetrically, but, the market has been  volatile and prices have risen significantly since the Nov. 3rd.  I also  don't know what the market situation is like on TGPL, would we be creating an  imbalance on a contract, is there a market to allocate to, are there any  potential penalties?   I would like to resolve this today, if at all possible.  Please advise.  Mary

farmer-d	 Teco Tap       87.500 / HPL Gas Daily  
farmer-d	 Daren, per review of the Gas agreements between Tenaska IV and  Williams/Apache and our understanding of the Agency agreement, I had a few  items I  wanted to discuss with you (in lieu of our meeting today that was  cancelled):  1. Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should  have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285)  and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary -  230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at  2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.  2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged  $2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91   price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at  2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.  I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for  2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment  if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and  increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at  .0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.  In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price  is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache  invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at  other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If  Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a  margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant  should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.  Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and  October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from  Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot  prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our  meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of  $.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas  delivery points if my scenario above is correct).  So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their  November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price  differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of  $484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of  Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.    Month   Plant Gas Price Amount   November  267,300  2.91 $777,843    November adjustment    $(167,062.50)      October adjustment    $(184,138.99)   Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000   Sept. Agency Fee 98,813  .04 $3,592.52        Total $484,234.03  I discussed these issues with Mike Mazowita, Rick Hill & Jody Pierce before  reaching this conclusion.  Should you have any different ideas or thoughts  that I am not covering, please call me at 3-7280 and we can discuss.  Thanks.  James 
farmer-d	 I think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up  for Williams and Apache.  On Williams deal 384237, the demand charge needs to  be removed from Sept. 2000.  The demand charge should not have started until  October 2000.   Because we did not know at the time what was happening with  this deal, the demand fee was inadvertently paid to Williams for Sept. and we  need to recoup our money.  On Apache deal 384247, James thinks we need to  remove the demand charge completely.  He says it is not a part of the deal  and Apache is not billing us for it.  We also need to talk about the pricing  on both of these deals.  Williams and Apache are billing us less than what we  have in Sitara.  To be able to keep this desk at zero, Jim Pond does not want  me to use pay the lesser of  for the purchases, so we need to address the  price differences.   You said you had some contract briefs that supported our  prices.  Please fax a copy to me at 713-646-8420 and I will compare them to  what James has.  Just a heads up...We are beginning to work on November 2000, so we will need  a demand fee entered (hopefully next week).

farmer-d	 Change in their safety net gas:  effective 3pm today - increase it from 9,000/d to 14,000/d, so total flow at  HPL meter would be 24,000/d  effective 9am tomorrow 12/20/00, decrease safety-net gas down to 6,000/d, so  total flow at HPL meter would be 16,000/d

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that  this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.

We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various  Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to  Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport  contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether  the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then,  is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are  considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered  to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?  I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the  correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be  if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas  into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I  would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the  Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough  leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?  Thanks for your help.

farmer-d	 Just wanted to thank everybody who works with Mobil Beaumont Refinery.  Our former three year deal with them expired September 30.  Last week, we  (finally) executed a new contract that keeps HPL as their largest natural gas  supplier through September 30, 2002.  Also, when their volumes go up in early  2001, they will once again be HPL's single largest industrial customer.  Everybody's hard work in keeping this customer happy has paid off.

farmer-d	 Daren:  On 5/1/2000 recorded flow of 9 Mmbtus from HPL's pipeline.   Deal #222051 was  at this meter during April 2000, but the deal expired on 4/30/2000.

farmer-d	 All of the outside sales for 11/00 have been paid.  We now need to forward  the cash to Tenaska IV.  The demand charge for deal 529856 should be  $341,250.47.  I have attached my spreadsheet.  The number is based on noms,  so when we receive the actuals I will send you a revised number.    Megan

farmer-d	 I'm assuming yes, but I don't really have anything to do with this one.  Any  insight Gary or Daren?     Mary M Smith 01/02/2001 01:41 PM To: Lauri A Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Dow trspt.  The Dow K# 012-24525-202 was terminated 12/31/00, therefore, a new K# was  setup (96054723).  My question is, does the rate of .025 remain the same for  Oasis Katy to Dow Stratton?  Let me know.  Thanks, Mary   
farmer-d	 Daren - meter 1517 has a nom of 0/day for Jan.  It flowed about 5.400 on day  1. This is a valid flow.  Could you please extend the deal from Dec. (deal #  506192) or create a new one?  Thanks.  AL 
farmer-d	 Daren:  On 6/16/99, HPL recorded flow of 10 Mmbtus from HPL's pipeline.   The Gas  Measurement Dept. verified the accuracy of this flow.  No Deals were place  for the month prior or the month after.  Currently, this volume is being  recorded to HPL's Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics needs approval to  write-off this volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.

farmer-d	 Yes, it will work.  Thanks.  We still need to look at the Apache and Williams  deals.  There are pricing and demand fee issues.  I can forward you the  emails if you need them.  Megan 
farmer-d	 FYI -   I spoke with Patsy, per Daren's request, regarding a swap with Midcon Texas.   Patsy agreed to lend us the gas we need at the meter, rather that swap with  us.  The net effect, after they pay back what HPL parked on them, according  to Patsy, is a lend of 12,276 MMBtu's.  MTP is going to confirm an addition  16,903 total to HPL.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Mary

farmer-d	 I am having trouble with the transport deal for the Tenaska IV contracts on  Lone Star.  We have deal 452491 in Sitara for meter 20014804 at a $0.01  transport rate.  We received the statement from TXU Lone Star and it does not  agree with our deal.  They are billing for meter 25000200 at $0.10 and meter  20014903 at $0.02.  These meters relate to the Tenaska IV sale deal 384258  and the Tenaska Marketing deal 459898, respectively.  Should our deal match  what TXU is billing or is there another deal that I am missing?  I haven't  worked with transport very much, so I could be confused.  I think we have  this problem with Oct 2000, also, but I have not reviewed it yet.  I am going  to look at it this afternoon.  Tenaska IV has already reimbursed us for the  TXU transport, so we will need to pay this next week.    Also, now that we have the actuals for Nov 2000, we need to update the demand  fees to reflect the correct volumes.  Barring any changes, I have listed the  adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet.  The Unify adjustments will be  over by about $20.00 from the spreadsheet.  I thought it would be better have  the Cleburne desk at zero, than to leave a balance.  1. Deal 529856 - Change 11/1 demand fee from $341,250.47 to $493,365.74  (Difference $152,115.27) 2. Deal 529856 - Change 11/2 demand fee from $167,062.50 to $159,721.55  (Difference $7,340.95) 3. Deal 514353 - Change Agency fee volume from 45,000/day to 45,016/day  (Difference $19.72)    Thanks, Megan

farmer-d	 Lauri,  HPL's Gas Control could not provide any information.  I called Bob Withers  with KCS and he was in agreement to reduce the nom from 894 to 345/ day.  The  changes will be effective 1/11/01 as follows:  Meter #  Deal #  9797   439825 3543   439837  Bob      Lauri A Allen 01/09/2001 03:53 PM To: Robert Cotten/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Michael Olsen/NA/Enron@Enron, Edward Terry/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jill T  Zivley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Poorman/NA/Enron@Enron  Subject: KCS Buy/Sell  In light of December's allocation of actual volumes at KCS #9797, it looks as  though we need to reduce the nom at both this meter and at Tejas Riverside,  #3543, where the "sell" portion of this buy/sell occurs for the remainder of  January.  December actual receipts at #9797 were 15,889mm or an average of  513mm/day.  The January nomination is 864mm/day.  I think it needs to be  reduced to approx 345mm/day effective 1/11 or there may be a large diffence  between what we buy at the wellhead and what is delivered back to KCS at  Tejas Riverside.  Any info you could get from gas control or KCS about actual  flow current month would help nail this nomination down.  Thanks.

farmer-d	 This is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the Texoma -  Beaumont interconnect (replace some valves, I believe).  We had discussed doing this at a time when Mobil Beaumont Refinery would have  low gas takes.  That window of opportunity will be in early to mid February.  Mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month.   Some of these units are endothermic, some are exothermic, so in some cases  their gas load goes up when they take certain units down.  But based on the  schedule of ups and downs that I've been given, it looks like their gas load  will be at a low point between February 1 and February 12, at somewhere  around 50,000/d.  Last we talked about HPL continuing to deliver 20,000/d  through the low pressure meter, and delivering the rest through Centana.  Is  this still the plan??  We met with Mobil last year in July to talk to them about what we need to  do:  that it would take less than a day, and that during that time, HPL would  deliver some of our gas to them through the Centana meter.  But that meeting  was a long time ago, and we might need to meet again - you know how  conservative  One thing of concern:  in the past two months, we have effected some of our  MidCon delivery obligation by delivering 30,000/d gas in kind to Mobil  Beaumont.  So we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our  maintenance.  Once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we'll handle  gas flows while we do our work, I'd like to be the one that initially tells  Mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting.  It's going to take a lot  of coordination because I can guarantee you that Mobil's maintenance schedule  will change!  Lee 3.5923

farmer-d	 To all:   The proposed sale of HPL to American Electric Power (AEP) has been signed and  the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming  months.  Over the next few days, I will be forwarding more details about the  transition process.  These details will outline the employment opportunities  and transfer process to AEP.   AEP is eager to complete these arrangements,  as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it.  During the transition period, it is important that we keep the pipe line  operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy  needs of our customers.  Regards, Brian

farmer-d	 Please follow the instructions below.  Why:  A suggestion was made (by Carlos) to centralize transport nominations  we receive by email.  We now have an email account set up:  HPL.Scheduling@enron.com.  The group is to let our customers know this is  where all nominations need to be sent.  This way, if people are out (or no  longer with us), someone will be able to receive the nomination change.  I  have also created folders for each shipper.  As each nomination is addressed,  the file is to be moved to the folder for later reference.  If the file is  still in the "inbox", it has not been addressed.  Any comments to this, I would greatly appreaciate feedback.   ---------------------- Forwarded by Edward Terry/HOU/ECT on 01/12/2001 03:27  PM ---------------------------     	 	 	From:  Enron Messaging Security @ ENRON                           01/09/2001  09:07 AM 	  To: HPL Scheduling Team cc:   Subject: Link to the HPL Scheduling Mailbox  <=<=Double-click on the link and the mail box will be added to your Lotus  Notes Workspace.

farmer-d	 There is a new version of Stack Manager which is being released this evening,  for use on Monday morning.  Changes  1) "Inactivate Suspended Children" - New menu item available by  right-clicking on a Parent Product. It will change all Child Products of the  highlighted parent from "Suspended" to "Inactive". Note that this will be  applied only to the product which you highlight. It will also show available  when highlighting Products which are not Parents, but it will have no effect.  2) The transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those  transactions completed on the calendar day (problem has affected Australia  and Singapore).  3) A Constant Spread which is changed from the front page of the Stack  Manager will stay as changed for that Product. The spread will persist even  if transactions occur.   Background  Suspended Child Products continue to have their prices updated as the price  of the Parent changes. Inactive Child Products do not have their prices  updated. The price update process slows down EnronOnline processing and Stack  Manager response, so it is advantageous to ensure all non-active Products are  in an Inactive state.   If you have any questions on the above, please contact the EnronOnline call  center at:  North America: 713 853 4357 (HELP) Asia and Australia: +61 2 9229 2300 Europe and Other Regions: +44 (0) 20 7783 7783   Dave

farmer-d	 Thanks so much.  Let's talk - I'll be back in the office on Thursday.  Have  fun and good luck with the house hunt and sale! 
farmer-d	 After getting your imput, I think this is the best:  We will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be  differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need  to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to  peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a  bonus (may need to finda another role within or outside Enron which is a  better fit).  Message to someone new to Enron in that category should be  different.  Glad they are here: believe that as they learn the organization  and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution: doing  the right thing to learn business, but that contributions to date are not  significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus.  Let me know what you think.  thanks  bob

farmer-d	 Here is an idea for this week.? Next week Brad  Cox is planning on starting a  discussion series based on the Experiencing God  study, that he will modify  for teenagers to be used in NEON.? It will  probably consist mainly of  questions similar to what you're getting this  week.? At this point in the  semester your kids hopefully feel comfortable  with each other to go ahead  and spring right into some Biblically relevant  discussions.? Make sure,  though, that you do what is necessary for your  kids to connect with each  other and with you as adults and to make visitors feel  at ease.? Spend time  visiting together as a group, and then individually  with the kids after NEON  is officially over with cokes and cookies.?  Remember that that the "before  and after" is probably the most important aspect  of NEON.  - Different beliefs.doc

farmer-d	 Beginning on January 14th at meter 988022 (United Salt), the BAV feed into  Pops shows excessive flow (over 200M/Day beginning the 15th).  O'Neal brought  this to my attention this evening.  This issue will blow out our UA4 number,  and probably our P & L.  I phoned Lee in Gas Control to make sure a tech was  sent out to check calibration and scada feed.  I would like to have better  estimates from the 14th through the 19th asap so that we can make corrections  to all pertinent numbers.  Thank you,  Mary

We expect  the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best  sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve  Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the  next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows  stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next  couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and  have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited  basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this  production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning  equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close  watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for  liquids fallout.

farmer-d	 Donald,  Back in October we had the gas received by HPL at the above meter moved to= =20 Strangers Gas pending a call from Coastal to renegotiate a contract for Sep= t=20 2000 gas.  Since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger=01,s gas it=  has=20 been placed on an MJG deal which was the only valid deal available for Sept= =20 2000. I assume Coastal has not contacted Brian as of yet.  Is it possible to have=  a=20 deal created for Coastal with a price of zero?  I know that we definitely d= o=20 not want to pay MJG for this gas, but as long as the volume is sitting on= =20 their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the= =20 payment out.

This  gas is to be transported by HPL to the inlet (meter 980415) and may or may  not be repurchased at the tailgate.  At this time, this gas is scheduled on  the Strangers IT agmt., we are waiting for Brian Riley to return to the  office so that we can determine if this will need to be placed on a separate  transport agreement to the plant inlet, or added to the old agreement.

PG&E did not fully process the  gas stream at their Indian Springs plant on December 12 and 13 and took the  reduced shrinkage, 19.000 MMBtu/d, and sold it to HPL at Gas Daily -$0.04.   PG&E did not have the right to do that, so they are going to allocate that  volume to Comstock, from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month  index.  At the same time PG&E will create an imbalance, for which they will  pay HPL the same amount HPL paid them for the gas for those two days.  This  should wash the sale at Gas Daily and leave HPL buying the gas at the  beginning of the month IFHSC ( the price in the Comstock purchase contract)  and selling it at the Gas Daily price for 12/12 and 12/13.

farmer-d	 I just have to brag on myself as my game seldom affords me the opportunity. Sunday after church, Tom Knox and I played 18 holes at Mimosa.  The weather was perfect.  While my game stunk overall (118), I did manage par on one par 3 and two par 5's.  The best was at 14 --- a 545 yard par 5.  My drive was 280 yards (the ground was flat!).  I was on the green three feet from the pin in 3, and then two-putted.  Those three pars however will keep me going back.  Remember, I had a witness!  Thanks for listening to me brag.  And no, don't expect me to replicate these feats on our next outing.  Hope all are doing well.  We're remembering Rachel and Jake in our prayers each day.  David

While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees  F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the  wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect  the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best  sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve  Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the  next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows  stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next  couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and  have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited  basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this  production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning  equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close  watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for  liquids fallout.

While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees  F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the  wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect  the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best  sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve  Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the  next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows  stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next  couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and  have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited  basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this  production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning  equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close  watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for  liquids fallout.

farmer-d	 FYI  Daren---On the 12th, there is a sale to Aquila on the Header system, for  10,000........I think we were supplying it with AEC.  For whatever reason, I  had the AEC 10.0 @ #11230 into Midcon...which isnt right because there was no  market for it, and Midcon wasnt looking for it, but the Aquila deal was at  #700 on WGR (Aquila).  So I went ahead and changed the AEC ticket to match up  with the Aquila deal. Let me know if you think it is incorrect.  Thanks, Mark

We are being asked, as a requirement, to not display the EOL id on statements  that are identified as "Broker EOL trade" deals originating from EOL.  We  have two options to accomodate this requirement:  Option 1 is to have the modify the bridge code to not bridge over the EOL  deal id if the deal is a "Broker EOL trade"  deal.  One of the drawbacks of  this option is that you won't be able to referenence the EOL id on the Path  Manager for these related deals.  All other deals will have the EOL deal id,  if applicable.  The EOL id would not show up on the statements because it  wouldn't be populated.  Option 2 is to modify several areas of code in the Settlements area which may  be more time consuming.  The obvious code change would be in the statement  generation area as well as other report type information.    Option 2 allows you the greatest flexibility while Option 1 may be quicker to  implement.    Please pass this along to others in your group and get feedback.  Please  share your thoughts.... I've attached an email explaining the Broker EOL trades.  This is not to be  confused with Broker deals done at a given point with not transportation.   These will continue to come across as you'd normally expect.  Any questions, please ask...  Thanks!

farmer-d	 Daren:  Sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue, I am with EES now.   Karen Lindley allocates this point but I feel the need to help her because  this issue came to light while I was in transition.  Exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on  a monthly basis.  December 2000 The total flow at the meter was 646 MMBtu.  I copied Esther Garcia on this  e-mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement  error.  Esther will need to respond to Karen on the matter of the possible  measurement error.  Furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8,928  MMBtu confirmed at this point and only 646 MMBtu flowed.  I would ask Mark  where he got his confirmed volumes from.  As a temporary fix I reallocated  the meter and gave the total flow to Alpine Resources.  They will be short  paid in their minds until Ester and Karen can get the possible measurement  error issue resolved.  I would also suggest that Mark and Karen get together  to review the scheduling of this point so that Karen can call Exxon to  reconcile their allocation with what we have (the additional Alpine deal) at  this point.  Charlene can redraft her invoice on Monday 2/26/01 that will  show the 646 MMBtu going to Alpine.  January 2001 Again scheduling has 9,193 confirmed at this meter when on 3,241 MMBtu  flowed.  I temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that  flowed went to Alpine.  They remain 10 MMBtu short paid but Charlene can  redraft her invoice and pay them something until Mark (validity of other  deals at this point) and Karen (Exxon's allocation of this point) can get  this issue resolved.  There is also the issue with the Exxon transport at this point that was  scheduled at 1,500 MMBtu per month for the months in question.  This  transport affects the allocation at the King Ranch tailgate on the Exxon 024  contract.  I copied Howard Camp who will be training the contractor that will  take my place in Volume Management so that he can stay on top of the  resolution of this issue.

farmer-d	 Saturday, March 3, the redeliveries into HPL from Fuels Cotton Valley for the Eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 MMBtu/dy.  This change should continue through March 5th or 6th.  The reason for the change is an operational emergency.  DEFS typically delivers approximately 12200 MMBtu/dy into TXU Lone Star.  This delivery will not be able to occur because the Alford B compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance. This compressor will be out of commission for the month of March.  The Busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 MMBtu/dy of Fuels Cotton Valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 MMBtu/dy of TXU Lone Star redelivery gas.  A different redelivery point with TXU Lone Star is being established and should be available by March 5th or 6th.  At this point in time, we will take the HPL Fuels Cotton Valley redelivery gas to zero and balance the redeliveries between the two points.  Therefore, DEFS will not change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for Eastrans.  After the new TXU Lone Star redelivery point is put into place and the points are volume balanced, it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 MMBtu/dy from Fuels Cotton Valley and 22700 MMBtu/dy into PG&E (which is what is in place effective 3/1/01) for Eastrans.

farmer-d	 California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve= ral=20 months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We= =20 want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=  =20 Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation= =20 and our position on California energy issues.  What happened in California  The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp= ly=20 and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.

This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.  In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related= =20 factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations= =20 forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for= =20 power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market= =20 when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo= ng=20 term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I= n=20 California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20 equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th= e=20 most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20 while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat= t=20 was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.  Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain= ed=20 in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20 competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa= le=20 prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20 regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.  In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat= ion. =20 Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new= =20 generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile= =20 spot prices.  At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned= =20 the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w= hich,=20 if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.  Enron=01,s Role  Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f= ix=20 the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20 politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:  ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the= =20 state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the= =20 same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20 market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar= e=20 interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc= ts=20 for our customers. ? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from= =20 the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We= =20 protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.  You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20 power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on= =20 the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=  of our=20 customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:  ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20 market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct= ly=20 from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20 allowing EES to access lower utility rates. ?

Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom= ers=20 with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more= =20 demand for our products and services.  The Solution  The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary= , the=20 state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark= et=20 and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.  Increasing Supply  California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing= =20 short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les= s=20 than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl= y=20 must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20 generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the= =20 regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20 displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can= =20 have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20 facilities.  Reducing Demand  Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. = =20 They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail= =20 market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman= d=20 at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market= .  Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market  In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20 volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer= =20 term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han= ds=20 of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market= . =20 Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the= ir=20 price risk.  Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions  The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20 greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to= =20 arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov= er=20 their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and= =20 distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is= =20 needed.  Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that= ,=20 while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters= =20 worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work= ed;=20 and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages= ,=20 which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20 ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether = it=20 is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall= ey=20 or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20 shortage worse.  The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20 California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that= =20 the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20 constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in= =20 California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20 generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road= s=20 and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

California should fully open its retail market.  Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market  In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market.  Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk.  Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State's Institutions  The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed.  Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that, while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don't work; have never worked; and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages, which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Valley or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse.  The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in, constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, roads and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.  As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media, it's important for you to know this:  We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state.

Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.  Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called "Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is $0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.

farmer-d	 Please respond to Here is the NEON lesson for March 28th!    - Experiencing God Week 4.doc  
farmer-d	 I have re-checked Sitara & verified that the above deal was a Term, Firm  deal.  This resulted in a GTC Purchase Firm contract being set-up in the  Global Contracts System.  The term of the GTC was set as the term of the deal  (4/1/00 thru 3/31/01) with no evergreen, meaning that the contract will  expire at the end of this month.  To the best of my knowledge, all GTC Purchase Firms have the same language &  they do not have evergreen.  They expire at the end of the primary term.  So, unless Exxon negotiated a deal with different, special language to allow  for evergreen & included something about a "10 day notification" to  terminate, there isn't any reason to "terminate" this contract.  If this is the case, please advise.  Otherwise, I don't think we need to do  anything.  The contract will expire at the end of this month on its own.       Elsa Villarreal 03/15/2001 02:42 PM To: Amelia Alland/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cheryl Dudley/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Exxon Company, USA Global # 96035668/Sitara # 212225  Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow March 16, 2001 on  the above referenced deal.  Houston Pipe Line Company has not renegotiated a  price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis.  It is my  understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the  delivery period  .  If you need any additional information or have any questions, please  contact me at 35656.  Thanks.  EMV  
farmer-d	 Just want to make sure volumes are allocated to two different tickets  correctly for March:  Sitara - 572910 - gets 50,000 MMBtu TOTAL for the month .... after 50,000 on  this ticket, all remaining volumes go to ...  Sitara 643510 - the swing ticket  THANKS  Lee 
farmer-d	 The attached spreadsheet reflects adjustments to wellhead meters effective  3/16/01.  The nominations were changed to volumes in the "To"  column.  Bob

farmer-d	 Hi, Just wanted to let you know that Lacy's sugar levels are staying up  pretty well.  She was down to 51 this morning, but she took a shot last night  & I guess she didn't eat enough ice cream.  She was mad at me cause I didn't  give her more than I did.  But it's so hard to know exactly how to handle it  'cause she's been going to bed a little high & getting up a little high.  But  anyway, she's doing better & I guess she'll always be mad & think I'm  mistreating her.  I stay stressed out every day not knowing if she got low  after I left & passed out & no one would know it.  I'm going to try to get a  cell phone & have her call me when she gets there--I think--I don't  know--she'll be mad about that too.  But the other night, she didn't eat  right after she took her shot, then didn't eat anything fast acting & got in  the truck to go over to Phillip's to get research info from his computer, got  low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs.  So that's what scares me.  She knew  to eat righ! t after she took that shot & didn't. But she was high before she took it & I  guess she didn't think about it getting low. I don't know what will happen to  her when she leaves home.  But anyway, I wanted to let you know that we're going to Dallas to look for  the prom dress & shoes, don't know if we will stay all night or not. I  haven't talked to Shane & Shelley.  I wanted to stay & go to Saturn Rd. to  church & go to the singles class.  But I don't know what Shane & Shelley have  planned.  So we'll be back either Sat. night or Sun. Lacy has to be back to  work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once.  So, wish us  luck.  Any donations will be appreciated!  I hear they're more than I was  expecting. But anyway, I don't intend to go overboard.  Maybe there will be  some sales. Hope my grandsons are doing ok.  I bet they were glad that their Daddy got  back home Sunday. Hug them for me & tell Cole that Mimi can't wait to see his  bunkbeds. Love ya'll

farmer-d	 Friday 3/23 - Received a page from Silver in Gas Control at 8:00 pm regarding  the Gulf Plains Plant.  They were cut into another pipeline (Tennessee), and  wanted to overdeliver to us by 10M for the night.  Larry Zammit paged 8:05  pm, reiterated same.  We agreed to take the additional volume for the  remainder of the evening only.  Saturday 3/24 - 7:30 am, received page from Lee in Gas Control regarding the  Gulf Plains Plant, apparently they felt that they may need to overdeliver for  Saturday's gas day as well.  Phoned Larry Zammit and spoke with him regarding  the situation at the plant, he indicated that there may have been a  miscommunication or misunderstanding at the plant.  Larry phoned the plant  and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver  to,  or swing on, HPL.   2:00 pm - Phoned Lee in Gas Control to see how the pipeline was doing.  He  indicated that we were pretty tight, but would probably make it without  utilizing any OBA's.  Sunday - So. Union requested 15M beginning at 11:00 am. The pipeline was  tight again, but Gas Control was okay.

farmer-d	 Effective 4/1/01, the deliveries and redeliveries will be 0 MMBtu/dy.  The Transaction Agreement will not be utilized. 
farmer-d	 We will soon be migrating to Windows 2000 and Outlook.  The Texas Desk is scheduled for Tuesday, April 10th.  I was told to pass along the following information to my group:  1.  You will be receiving emails from the migration team ("GEM") - please be sure to only open this from your own desktop, and not remotely.  This is very important.  These messages will be explaining the migration process and what you need to do to insure a successful migration.  2.  Due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE migration.  With Outlook, you will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  Outlook will issue a warning once you reach 75 MB to let you know that you are near your Mailbox Limit.  Once you reach 100 MB, you will be prevented from sending email, but you will still be able to receive internal and external messages  You will then need to reduce the size of your mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, etc. before you will be able to send an email again.  3.  From the day of migration, only 30 days of old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of migration will be migrated.  4.  Everyone will have a read only view of Notes until the transition is completed.  You will be able to copy/paste.  Thanks, Laura

farmer-d	 Hi Bubba!  Lacy got her eye exam yesterday.  He said that she is very near sighted, but  the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all.  That was a relief. She's been  having headaches, so I was concerned. They probably have been from her blood  sugars being out of control.  She is doing so much better now.  I have  stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much  better. She's acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I  guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was  wrong with her.  She doesn't say the cruel things to me that she used to.  I  knew something had to be wrong with her.  I thought surely I had not raised a  child with such a mean spirit.  Anyway things are a lot better.  Tell Cole that Mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as Lacy's.  Let  him call to tell me about it.  I hope he gets his teary eye "fixed". Lacy's eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes.   He couldn't believe her teeth are so perfect without braces. And she is so  tanned, you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she  smiles.  She has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next  week.  We'll talk later about when we are coming to your house.I'm going to  Longview to a singles retreat Sat.in case you call & I'm not there.  Will be  home Sat. night. Love ya, Maw

farmer-d	 Tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional Big  Cowboy production is coming from.  Apparently, HPL cut a deal to purchase  this gas at "HPL meters" at Rocher and Big Cowboy #2, so the gas had been  pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe.  All along, these volumes  have been flowing into the GEPL/Big Cowboy system and on to King Ranch.  Tom  and I spoke with Clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and  determined that a Transport Usage ticket needed to be put into place, as IM  Wellhead, to transfer the volumes from HPL to GEPL and into the plant.    We unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the HPL purchase to the TU  tickets and moved the gas on our transport on GEPL to the plant, effective  April 1.  This resolves our overproduction issues for April and forward.  Please let me know if you have any further questions, comments, or  information to add.   Mary

farmer-d	 Daren,  According to Vance's response to Lauri's email, the nominations should be  revised upwards approximately 650/d on the gathering contract(s) at this  meter.  There is currently nominations of 1,353/d (1,153 gathering and 200  transport).  The flow should be around 2,000/d.  Is it alright to include the  increase of 650/d with the other revisions to be made after trading on Friday?

Consequently, for March, HPLC should be purhasing volumes from two wells at  meter 5310.  Effective April, HPLC amended the same contract releasing the  L.G. Talbert #2 lease in the committed reserves agreement; Mike Morris is the  gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000mmbtu/d.  For April I nom  1132/d; Bob, we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental  production at this point.

There have been no changes in the producer services noms at this  point, however.  This point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow  I have access to shows noms of 1332mm with BAV of 3497mm on March 18th.   Bob/Vance- could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should  be?  Copano says they're not getting the gas in April either, but they do not  know how long HPLC is purchasing the incremental gas from Royal.  Please let  me know what the resolution is.  Thanks.

We are in the process of drafting procedures which will have to become a formal protocol for AEP.  These are:  Request for New/maintenance of counterparties.  Once Web page is developed, procedures will be completed.  Request for new portfolios (books) after close.  Drafting procedures.  Request for new employee security.  Request to change curve mapping in ERMS/CPS.  Drafting procedures.  Also, it appears the IT service agreement may have to be amended to cover the  Web pages used to push operational data to customers (If AEP wants to continue the service) and the Tariff filing system we just put into production.  Also, we will need to resolve how we handle counterparties that Enron credit has request we suspend trading when AEP wants to continue trading.

farmer-d	 Jill,  I have had several discussions with Daren Farmer and below are a few questions remaining.  Ann Mag - Which plant does this gas come into or out of?  Daren Farmer indicated that NGPL/Trunkline is connected to La Gloria (Agua Dulce) and Tenn/Coral/Shannel are connected to the Gulf Plains plant (Agua Dulce minus).  Do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery?  If so Daren said we would prefer the Gulf Plains Plant. Oakhill - Are all three at the Carthage hub?  If so, then the Texas desk will give a quote, probably HSC minus, otherwise the East and Central desk will need to quote the volume into TETCO and Koch Mid, respectively. Vaquillas Ranch KM - What plant processes this gas? White Heron - Where is this?  Could not find it on the map and Daren was not familiar with this field. Sheridan Field - Daren assumed this was the Shell Sheridan Plant, but he wanted to verify with you. Hungerford North - Where is this? Bear Den - Where is this? Moore's Station - Where is this? Dan Hughes - HPL is quoting this volume (as well as several other field connected to HPL) and they need a meter number for this field.   We have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of Friday being "Good Friday" and basically all of the 32nd floor being out, myself included.  So, let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions.  The properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up, or will be tomorrow morning.  Call with any questions  Eric  Work		713-345-7754 Cell		713-412-7754  PS - Just a reminder, we are getting the volumes quoted at our preferred liquid point and it will be EEX's responsibility/burden to get the gas to that point.

Thanks- katherine ---------------------- Forwarded by Katherine Herrera/Corp/Enron on 03/06/2001 03:24 PM ---------------------------     	Enron North America Corp.  From:  Bryce Baxter @ ECT                           03/05/2001 06:33 PM	 		   To:	George Weissman/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:	Donnie Myers/NA/Enron@ENRON, Katherine Herrera/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Baumbach/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject:	GLO/EGM Gas/Crude Swap  George - I've done some T-accounts (the bean counter in me) and I think the following is the best way to handle this going forward: 	 Change the existing deals, 547201 and 591307, to a zero price.  This will eliminate the A/R balance on HPL's books for GLO, but will keep the volume nom'd to GLO and will not impact UA4. Enter a ticket on HPL for a sale to ENA for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets.  This should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $974,144 for 1/01 and $766,304 for 2/01. Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book purchases the demand from HPL.  The amounts would be the same as in #2 above. Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book sells demand to EGM for the value of the crude oil for the prior month.  For 1/01, the sale would be for $886,638.60 (the 12/00 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).  For 2/01, the sale would be for $839,008.29 (the 1/01 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).  This will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward: The price on the sale from HPL to GLO will need to be zeroed out monthly. The demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out. The demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to EGM.  Once this is done, the A/R balance for GLO will be cleared, the margin will be on the ENA Wellhead book, and the intercompany transactions will move the money from EGM to HPL.  This needs to be done monthly prior to flash, which will prevent any OA variances.  The index for the gas value is available shortly after the 1st of the month, and since the volume is firm, there shouldn't be a problem calculating the value.  We should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ENA to EGM.  If you have any questions or see a better way to do this, please let me know.  Thanks.            <Embedded StdOleLink>

farmer-d	 Saxet is flowing about 5200ish. 
farmer-d	 Janet and Daren, Attached is a gas supply proposal I receive from Duke Energy for delivery to the mission interconnect on TETCO.  They also provided me a quote on Tenn, but it was way off base.  This deal in combination with swing from NET may be a good start for the month of May.  The deal provides swing flexibility and would allow us to get our feet wet and see how NET operates the Mission system when they are not providing all of the delivered gas.  Let me know what you think.  I have had discussions with Elpaso/PG&E, Elpaso Merchant, Coral, and Reliant.  At this point, the Duke/TETCO option is the best that I have seen.  I look forward to comparing notes and having further discussion next week.

farmer-d	 Daren, Is there any Industrial meters in particular I need to watch the imbalances since we are close to the end of the month?  Thanks - Julie   
farmer-d	 Bob,  Questions based on the information in the Facilitation by Location Report:  1.  Meter 9643 HGPL/HPL - Stratton, Tejones Operating Corporation, sitara 266970:  Should this purchase be at meter 9638, FREEMAN PROD-MAXINE FIELD in Trade Zone 18?  2.  I presume we are not counting BOTH Meter 9848 NORTH PADRE ISLAND BLK8 and Meter 9862 LEHMAN/SPINNAKER ONSHORE.  Isn't this the same gas?  3. Meter 3536 SEAHAWK/A-S (MAT PLT 520), EOG Resources, sitara 725391:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?  4.  Meter 6884 PGTT JUNCTION 16" LEASE, Comstock Oil & Gas, Inc. and Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Onshore L.P., sitara 125899 and 132975:  Comstock's volume should exceed Kerr-McGee's volume, and together the two volumes should be approximately 73,000/d.  Currently, Comstock's volume is only 8,600/d and Kerr-McGee's volume is 25,000/d.   We look about 38,000/d short.  5.  Meter 639 HANNAH NASH, Coral Energy Resources, L.P., sitara 659998:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?  I'm looking at about 10 other old deals that I think should be in for May, but aren't.  In addition, I'm adding in the new deals that will flow in May.  I'll be done by noon.  George

farmer-d	  Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin S#745589.  And there are three deal out there for CSGT #639612, #639615, #745589.  The problem is that none of these deals have actuals.  It looks as though they have not been nom'd.  Daren are these deals real or what?  Why have they not been nom'd?  Could they be under another Dow company?  Tess, I'm leaving the office for a little bit today.  But I'll be back this afternoon.

Per Dow Hydrocarbon's Accountant, Marilu Trochta's e-mail below, (with attachment), there are volume and price discrepancies with what  ENA billed them and what she reflects in her system. ENA Invoice # 24636SA invoiced Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc, on CSGT @ B368-Brazos, per deal number SA639615, @ 685 per day (3/1/01 - 3/31/01) @ HSC GDP D.A. - $0.07/mmbtu.

I realize that the volumes ENA billed on the Brazos are estimates or noms. Problem: I need to confirm the March 2001, sale @ Brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale @ Blue Dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price).  Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, Sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler(s) are?

farmer-d	 Daren,  When I look back in CPR for the delivery periods of 10/00 - 12/00 on CPR Pipeline Exchange, I do not see anything being flashed as an imbalance, i.e. the buys and sales always equal in CPR.  However, we are booking an imbalance every month on the parking and lending contract.  Should there be something in CPR for these volumes?  Let me know because it is causing an OA variance for us.

farmer-d	 Mary,  As in my email below to Daren, we are seeing some OA variances between flas= h to actual on the PLE contracts on PGEV for 10/00-12/00.  I have verified = with Thu Nguyen of what the statements from PGEV show and that is also what=  we have booked in Unify and recorded to the G/L as an imbalance.  However,=  when looking in CPR (under CPR Pipeline Exchange), there was not anything = flashed for those months, thus our OA variance.  I seem to remember that St= acy once said that although we may run an imbalance at the end of a month o= n occassion, in those few times that we do, 1)it should be relatively small=  and 2) in the following days of the next month, we should have worked the = imbalance down to zero thus having no imbalance at the end of the month.  I= n a voice mail from Daren today, he seemed to think the same thing was happ= ening or even that by the end of each month, we were balanced to zero.  Can=  you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had = an imbalance and if we should have, why there would have not been anything = flashed.  If we should not have had an imbalance, then we'll need your help=  to figure out what went wrong in that PGEV shows an imbalance on their sta= tements.  Let me know what you think.........

farmer-d	 Thu,  We have an ongoing issue every month between what we nominate from GEPL into HGPL and on to King Ranch (flows into HGPL at meter 8284) and what is in the system as purchase gas upstream of the meter.  The volume has been anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000/Day over the nomination for at least the past six months.  Would you please fax the meter statements from GEPL for February so that I can try to determine which meters are flowing over what is nominated and verify that we have deals in the system for each offsystem meter.  Should you require a more specific listing, I have Tom's schematic of the area.  Thank you for your time.  Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Mary

Attached is a file that summarized our discussions.  The items marked in yellow are ones Jill is requesting your services, mainly to see if we can get transport and keep our bid competitive.  Please review and we can talk sometime tomorrow as I have meetings all afternoon today.  If you have a chance to start working this today and have some questions, just call Jill, Jennifer or Santiago.  Thanks,  Eric

Problem: I need to confirm the March 2001, sale @ Brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale @ Blue Dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price).  Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, Sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler(s) are?

farmer-d	 I would think that the first contract should go the AEP.  ENA won't be selling to Equistar off of Channel for at least three months.  ENA will have to get a transport agreement with HPL or Channel.  On the second contract:  Is HPL making the sale or ENA?  Is it a sale that is going to AEP.  I know we are serving a small Entex point off of Oasis.  Is that for convenience, can HPL sever the point some other way?  Someone let me hear what you think.  thanks  bob    -----Original Message----- From: 	Wynne, Rita   Sent:	Friday, April 27, 2001 8:17 AM To:	Hall, Bob M Cc:	Dudley, Cheryl; Graves, Melissa Subject:	HPL Transport Contracts  I spoke with Daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of:  1.

However, we have been transporting the gas under ENA.  This is primarily for spot and base deals.  We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.  The only term deal we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).  This deal is under ENA with it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previously Teco/PGEV).  The sale and transport will go with HPL.  The sale to Entex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be served off of Oasis.  So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this deal.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.  Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.  Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.  We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.  Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

farmer-d	  Good God ---- where do you find time for all of that. You  should write a book when the kids go off to college. By then you should have  many many stories.   By the way what is your new address? I may want to come by  some evening with a lawn chair and a 6 pack. Watching you work sounds better  than anything on TV.   You will make a good trader. Good relationships and flexible  pricing are all you need. Oh, and a few zillion other intangibles you will  run into. It beats the hell out of most other things though.

farmer-d	 Daren,  We are not receiving timely information from the Hub regarding our Park and=  Lend Agreement.  I have not received an update since Tues or Wed of last w= eek.   Mike has been phoning them furiously for information and has been to= ld that they don't have it, or it will be ready later.  Per GISB, final sch= eduled numbers on EPNG, NNG, and TW are reported at 9:00 am the following d= ay (ie. Sunday final will be out at 9 AM on Mon.).  Prior to the transition=  from PG&E, we received our balance by 9:15 or 9:30 AM.  I realize that the=  transition has been difficult, they are never a cake walk, however, this t= ype of information is crucial.  Further, they have not provided any final n= umbers for the month of April, we should at least be able to receive a "bes= t available" number, and the Interstate Pipes, due to GISB, have final sche= duled numbers available on the first of the month.  I submit that ENA shoul= d not be held liable for payment of the $0.03/day rate, as we have not rece= ived the information we need to balance the agreement.  If EPGT plans to ad= minister fees, then balance information should be communicated on a timely = basis.  We may want to check the terms of the agreement, and/or negotiate a=  reduced rate for the month of May.  Thank you,  Mary 
farmer-d	 Darren, per our earlier conversation, here are the facts related to the opportunity to service a plant in the Freeport area off of Dow.  The potential customer (Don Owen) has supplied this plant for the past 15 years, buying supply from Dow. Dow does not want to be a supplier in the future, but of course, will transport. Dow will quote only a 2 year transport ($0.06 from Katy to the plant), but the customer wants a minimum of 5 years. Other bids he is getting at Index + .03/.04 less whatever transport. The swing load is approx. 1300-1350 MMBtu/d,  but fairly steady he says.  Let me know if you have any interest or if I should pass this along to someone else. Thanks.  PS The customer will give more info if we are interested, but wanted to see if we have interest first (and also if we had long term capacity on Dow) 
farmer-d	 Hey--Just thought I'd let you know that Lacy went to school this morning-pale & not feeling well--stomach still hurts, but she went ahead.  She's stressing me out big time.  She acted like she couldn't hardly move, but I came back in the house & she was talking fine on the telephone.  But I ask her questions about how she feels & she is just about dead.  I don't know about her.  But she looked pale.  Blood sugar was a little low this morning.  I woke her up at 2 & had her check it & it was good. So I got a little more rest.  I don't think she even woke up enough to remember it.  I don't think the little job is good for her if she's gonna catch everything they have.  She's so careless about washing hands after handling all those nasty little kids & then bites her nails.  Not good!  Anyway, I'm stressed big time over her & over her driving the car. And missing so much school.  I wasn't going to take her to the dr. yesterday because she was better so I figured it was a virus, b! ut she had to have a note from a doctor or she's gonna have to make up school on Saturday & they've threatened to fine me. So I had to pay $30 for them to tell me that she had a virus & missed a day of work.  Oh, well, life is fun.  Anyway, I need to quit gettin down over such trivial things cause there's so many with worse problems to face. I am thankful that the burdens are so light.  But you can still pray for us.  And encourage Lacy to work at Splash Town! Ha! Remind me to tell you about the terroristic  threat at High School.  Another high stress time!  Can't wait until this weekend to see all my cousins & ya'll.  Kiss my grandsons for me.  Love ya

farmer-d	 We invoiced Mirant Americas for deal 705989 and they do not see the deal in their system.  It was for 5,000/day from 4/1 - 4/2 at 5.10 on PG&E Texas.  Can you tell me who you did this deal with at Mirant?  Megan 
farmer-d	 Yes, the dollar amount is what we need to recoup from Williams.  I will take the credit with our payment to Williams on the 25th.  Tenaska  will send us their wire to us on the 24th.  I will make sure we receive the wire from Tenaska before I send the wire to Williams.  I will also let James know about the volume for the agency fee.

There are two tabs, one tab contains the days May 16-18, 2000 and the other tab contains the days May 14-18, 2001.  Each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question.  The days most directly comparable are May 17, 2001 (Thursday) and May 18, 2000 (Thursday), although the two days preceding May 18, 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding May 17, 2001.  The peak on 5/17/2001, 44,923 MW, is 2.78% higher than the peak on 5/18/2000, 43,709 MW.  With similarly warm days before 5/17/2001 as there were before 5/18/2000, the peak would obviously have been even higher.  This would put the year-over-year growth in excess of 3%.  I believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year-over-year from an earlier analysis, somewhere in the range of 3.5% to 4%.    Let me know if you have any questions or comments.    
farmer-d	 Daren,  The intercompany/interdesk reflects an error for the above referenced day.  A transport usage ticket was put into the system for 3,000 Dth (Duke Carthage to Texoma), however, we do not have any supply on EPGT from Duke for this deal.

farmer-d	  Hi,   The number is 281-370-7838.   I did not think of it, but without the pipe one has to balance  ones own, doesn't one. Of course the major problem was the people with HPL, not  the counter-parties. Who's doing that for you guys?   Jen came home for the Memorial Day weekend so we just bummed  around. Saw Pearl Harbor, watched a few DVD's, and ate way to much.   When you get time let us know about your "bad luck". I hope  Jake wasn't helping you too much.   I have been occupying much to much time with our new sound  system. We finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of Yamaha  stuff coupled to an equally large stack of Klipsch speakers. Awesome is the only  word to apply. I'm sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door. (It's  a young couple with a baby) (Not near as nice as the other young couple I  know). Rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good.  :)   Stock market still sucks, but as long as it pays for groceries  and taxes we'll be OK.   I'm off to get Linda's gas guzzlin, environment ruining, SUV  washed and buffed. Then I must re-stock my CD-R's and load up on some more  music. You can see how well I'm utilizing my time in doing productive  things.   Later, Ken   P. S. I thought WAHA was where all the pillaging of California  was taking place.

farmer-d	 Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths that I need to finish it:  January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have                       11,129 dth on the interconnect.  February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should                        have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.  July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth                  on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly                  need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118 
farmer-d	 Gloria, the difference between the two pipes for July 2000 is the actuals came in lower than what was nominated and scheduled on MOPS.

farmer-d	 Daren, Sitara has two different prices for May 31,2001 causing a problem. According to Lee Papayoti, the price for the swing volumes should beHSC_FLW+1High.GDP.D.A.

farmer-d	 Whether you're investing for your kids' education or your retirement, the new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach. The $1.35-trillion tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas, from investing for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes.  Many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years. But to help you take advantage of all possible provisions, we should start planning soon. Some of the ways you may benefit include:  Lower income tax rates. The gradual reduction of tax rates has already begun. In fact, the new withholding schedule went into effect on July 1. And, you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new 10% bottom rate retroactive to January 1, 2001. As tax rates fall over the next few years, your disposable income will likely rise - offering an opportunity to invest more toward your various goals.  Education-funding incentives. Parents who want to help their children attend college may now find their financial task easier. The tax relief act will improve education savings tools such as:  ? Education IRAs - The accounts' contribution limit will rise from $500 to $2,000 in 2002. What's more, money in these accounts can now be used for elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education expenses.  ? State sponsored 529 college savings plans - Also beginning in 2002, distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax free. Currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the beneficiary's rate upon withdrawal. 529s are particularly attractive due to their generous contribution limits.  ? Deductions for education expenses - The act increases eligibility for student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher education expenses.  ? The Child Tax Credit - Though not tied specifically to education expenses, this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college. Previously $500 per qualifying child under 17, the credit increases to $600 in 2001-2004, $700 in 2005-2008, $800 in 2009 and $1,000 in 2010 and thereafter.  Higher retirement plan contribution limits. The tax act will allow people with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and IRAs - possibly helping them retire sooner and more comfortably. Your options may include:  ? Traditional and Roth IRAs - Annual contribution limits for both of these types of IRAs will gradually rise from $2,000 this year to $5,000 in 2008. After that, the limits will be indexed to inflation in $500 increments.  ? 401(k)s and 403(b)s - Working individuals also may be able to invest more in their employer retirement plan. The limit on elective deferrals will gradually rise from $10,500 this year to $15,000 in 2006, and this doesn't include the catch-up contribution provision for people 50 years and older.  And much more. There are other provisions in the new tax law that may benefit you and your family. When we meet, we'll identify the ones that apply to you and help you make the most of them.  As you can see, the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number of areas. But because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be flexible enough to react to year-by-year changes.  Such planning is where American Express Financial Advisors excels. I'm backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation, investments, estate and retirement planning, and more to help you make the most of your finances.  Let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing you. Byron    "Make all you can, save all you can, give all you can."  				               JOHN WESLEY  Byron W.

farmer-d	 I looked at the service records and, for Oct 2000 through April 2001, we have paid $381,263.04 to TXU for transport.  We have another $159,745.14 in draft status.  The two amounts total $541,008.18.  I'm not sure why we have items in draft status.  Antoinette Beale handles the transport payments and I think she is out today.  I know she was having trouble with the volumes coming over.  I have left her a message to call me when she gets back so we can finalize those payments.  The May 2001 estimates total $57,249.44 in the system.  Let me know if you need any more information.

farmer-d	 Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook.  Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example: Username: jdoe4 Password: ******** Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape. Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use. Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.  If you have any questions, please call:  Resolution Center at x31411 or 	ETS Solutions Center at x54745

I just have a couple of paths that I need to finish it:  January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have                       11,129 dth on the interconnect.  February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should                        have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.  July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth                  on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly                  need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

farmer-d	 I need the following........  Assume we are in the new building and we have technical problems that force us out of the building either due to IT connection issues or problems with the building itself (AC, power, etc.). If we do have to leave the plan is to have the 30th floor completely available in this building as a backup for both the gas and power side. Obviously space is limited so what we will do is only bring the people that need to be in the building to get noms out and send the others home to handle business remotely. One approach is to take the EDI pipes and have them go to the 30th floor to ensure they have the support and quicker system then if they did their noms from home. Using this approach, and considering the space constraint please give me the number of desks you will need on the 30th floor. I'm open to suggestions so if you have a different approach or some good ideas feel free to share them. I need this by Friday 7/27 no later than noon.

farmer-d	 Daren,  I contend that a person should be given their birthday as a paid holiday. However, I know that the likelihood of your being off work during bid week is extremely slim.  I hope that you have a great day anyway and a great weekend with your precious family.  We'll give you a call this evening or over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting (and so Sally can sing to you).  We are so looking forward to seeing you, Tonya, Cole and Jake next weekend. We're disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to come a few days early.  We will certainly enjoy our visit with them.  Thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to Tonya that you are.  It gives Sally and me such joy seeing Tonya highly honored and loved by you.  You are a wonderful father too and it's so apparent the bond of love that you enjoy with your sons.  They watch your every move and hang on your every word.  We're so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader of your family, for being such an outstanding provider for their every need, and for putting up with the "outlaws".  In addition to our friendship, I love you as my own son.  Again, happy birthday.   David

We plan to run over  there in September for a few days. Maybe do Disneyworld.   Jeni is supposed to get us tickets to the  Nebraska game in Waco this year. That should be fun.

farmer-d	 Jay,  For June, I need a couple of things changed in Sitara:  Deal 819592 - the commodity price needs to be 3.6318 Deal 819594 - the commodity price needs to be WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A+.02  And for July............ It looks like we're missing some volume............ Deal 895651 - baseload deal - should have 55,000 per day allocated. AND in Sitara this deal should be priced at $3.0505. Deal 895691 - swing deal - currently has 234,000 in the scheduled column and it should be 441,000 based on the spreadsheet I sent. Did you have some conflicting volumes? I'm resending what the volumes should be. AND the pricing for this should be at WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A+.02.     I think that should do if for now. I'll wait to see how these changes come across.

farmer-d	 Darren: I'm not sure if you can help me with this, but I don't know who else to ask.  For April and May, we have gas pathed on deal 133304 to Conoco at the GEPL Big Cowboy point.  Conoco is saying that we did not buy that gas from them.  They have accounted for all of the HPL Big Cowboy gas and think we have over paid by about $1.5 mil each month for the GEPL gas.  Do you know why we added the GEPL meter to the deal in April?  Could we have bought this gas from someone else?  I have the meter statements from Tejas, but they do not say who the supply company was.  Megan 
farmer-d	   Thoughts on Texas A&M... Fox Sports Show Host Jim Rome  1)   They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and old army,and red ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat UT, and blah blah blah. Shut up. You start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite UT. 2)   Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school (University of Texas) that would teach agriculture and mechanics. Aggies love to say their school is older, from where they get that I don't  now......the fact is, the State intended A&M to be a branch of UT. They are like the afterbirth fromthe original creation.  Like Danny Devito in "Twins". 3)   So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good. All the while, nobody at UT denies that A&M is a good school, yet they won't shut up. So they write a fight song......about?....Texas, and how they want to beat them. They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It is the world's largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested in everything A&M does. 4)   The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at A&M. There are some nice people there. However...there is the Corp.  East Texas' answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys, there is the Corp. Now, forget the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades enroll if they agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Gestapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in 1995. Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed against them, and swept under the rug over the years, they just this past month have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy.  Not only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khaki-clad-shaven-headed-dorks, I am sure each of you have your own stories. The point is: We all respect West Point, Annapolis, The Air Force Academy; however, nobody respects the Corp. I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world. Just because you dress like the Army, and try and act like the Army, does not make you the Army. People at A&M don't even respect these clowns. It is not cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat up civilians, move to Israel. 5)   It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national television and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be against the law. I know that in College Station, students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked down upon. Especially if you are doing it on my TV. That is why we have moved the game from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game, some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's Thanksgiving dinner. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board. Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter. Screw that, forget make-up, it is too late for that, just give them a veil. 6)   "t.u." is not funny. It is NOT insulting. It is dumb. Just imagine if folks from Texas kept talking about M&A and giggling. That would not be funny. In fact, it would be retarded. That's why UT fans don't do it. Please learn. 7)   You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of sheep, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall down.Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV. Quit whooping in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yell. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're running for Governor. When you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the form asks for your phone #, H & W, quit putting 258-3999, Height 6'3", Weight 185.  Just, collectively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to East Texas, tour every small town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade education why they cheer for A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base. This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid. 8)   Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder, they might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability.  The point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. Quit getting geeked up about marching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college? 9)   Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe. Oh wait...I understand now. 10)  Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly. 11)  Finally, College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that it is a great college town. It is a town and there is a college there.That should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get any better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending "Dukes of Hazard" episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to Austin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and open minded population base. Austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool.  As my friend Stephen Johnson once said: "If the world were ever to get an enema, College Station is where you would connect the hose." If you go to school at A&M, please don't be an Aggie. God Bless the Great State of Texas.  Brian Puls Software Engineer Lockheed Martin-Enterprise Solutions 281 218-2740  
farmer-d	  One year rate for this one will be $.35/mm for volumes greater than 300mm/day.  Price for volumes 300mm/day or less will be $.45/mm plus a $350 per month metering fee.  This rate would cover transport to a competitive Ship Channel market such as Equistar Channelview.  Transport rates for a 6 month term are not significantly different- $.33/mm for volumes greater than 300mm/day and $.42/mm plus the metering fee for volumes 300mm/day or less.  These rates assume a September 1, 2001 start.  These rates good until Friday, August 31, 2001 only!!!  Get 'em while they're hot!! 
farmer-d	  I have felt a renewed heart for God, a fresh spirit.   I have been in the word lately and Doug and I have to committed to prayer time  together each morning.  It has brought a more positive attitude, much joy,  and thankfulness on my part.  And, yes, satan has already tried to steal  that joy.  But he will not prevail, I will not let Him.  So in those  times when I feel that any bit of joy is seeping away, I begin to pray.  I  found this prayer to be refreshing and worded well.  Please read it,  it may just jumpstart your day and you'll be filled with joy.  Have a  great day!  Amber Please  take a moment to relax your mind and humble your heart to focus on  Christ. Allow God, to be the only person on your mind while you read  this prayer. If we can take the time to read long jokes, stories,  etc., we should give the same respect to this prayer. Friends that pray  together, stay together. Let's pray...  Father  God, I thank You for this day. I thank You for my being able to see  and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God  and an understanding God. You have done so much for me and You keep on  blessing me. Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or  thought that was not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your  forgiveness. Please keep me safe from all danger and harm. Help me to  start this day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make  the best of each and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear from  You. Please broaden my mind that I can accept all things. Let me not  whine and whimper over things I have no control over. Let me continue to  see sin through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil. And when I sin,  let me repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing, and receive the  forgiveness of God. And when this world closes in on me, let  me remember Jesus' example - to slip away and find a quiet place to  pray. It's the best response when I'm pushed beyond my limits. I know  that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to use me to  do Your will.?Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to  others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak. Keep me uplifted  that I may have words of encouragement for others. I pray for those that  are lost and can't find their way.  I pray for those that are  misjudged and misunderstood. I pray for those who don't know You  intimately. I pray for those that will delete this without sharing it  with others. I pray for those that don't believe. But I thank you that I  believe. I believe that God changes people and God changes things. I  pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each and every  family member in their households. I pray for peace, love and joy in  their homes that they are out of debt and all their needs are  met. I pray that every eye that reads this knows there is no  problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is  in Your hands for You to fight. I pray that these words  be received into the hearts of every eye that sees them and every  mouth that confesses them willingly. This is my prayer. In  Jesus' Name, Amen. If you prayed this prayer, change the number  in the subject box before forwarding the message so people can  SEE how many people have done so. > > > >  >>> > God Bless!!!!!!!!!!!

farmer-d	 Changes are in blue.  Last month there was some confusion from several schedulers I spoke to about when changes could be made to (August) after the cut off:  As noted in the table, after Friday, August 31st at 6PM there can be no changes (i.e. re-nominate, re-track, re-balance, bridge back to Sitara etc.) made to August production until Wednesday morning, September 5th.    At 6PM Friday (or before if you are ready) I will be by to pick up the reports and exceptions dialogue.  thx RP

farmer-d	 Darren: ENA was invoiced by Coral Energy for two deals on Tejas for June 2001 that I do not see in the system.  The first deal was on 6/1 for 5,400 at $3.87.  The second deal was on 6/13 for 22,000 at $4.25.  Do you know anything about these deals?  I think we would show it on ExxonKaty, but I can't find anything in path manager on ExxonKaty or Tejas.

farmer-d	 As requested, this is the summary of what we have discussed regarding KAF deal.  Scenario 1: HPL nominates 6,200 MMBTU/Day, Apr'02 - May'02, ( 409,000 MMBTU total) of their south Texas production into the Kathleen Anne Field in Wilson County, TX.  And Enron replaces this same volume in the location of their choice.  Scenario 2: Scenario 1 plus ENA sells HPL 500,000 MMBTU of storage service with an injection rate of approximately 15,000 MMBTU/Day and a withdraw rate of 37,500 MMBTU/Day to help them serve the swing on the Tuffco contract.  Notes: The field is not yet connected to HPL, but will be.  Thanks for your help.  George Huan Gas Structuring

farmer-d	 Daren, I wanted to check with you on the current status of the of TXU Pipeline imbalance for Tenaska IV.  I noticed on the July statement I just received that the imbalance was at 125,374 MMBTU.  I am not sure if you have been told, but Enron recently entered into a sale agreement with El Paso to sale our interests in this plant by the end of September.  Talking with Rick Hill, he did not want to have a large imbalance liability with the pipeline at the end of September.  Do you think this imbalance will be significantly resolved by the end of the month?  You can call me at 3-7280 if you have any questions.  Thanks.  James 
farmer-d	 James, thanks for following up on this.  FYI to all, the agreement we have with El Paso has a fairly tight confidentiality provision that goes to internal (as well as external) communication of the transaction:  "No party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers, employees, representatives, consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information, all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information." The language stems from a problem we had when East Coast Power was sold late last year, but probably works to our advantage in this case.  Suffice to say that this group needs to be plugged in on what's coming down the pipe.  However, we need to limit discussion of the transaction to the maximum extent possible.

farmer-d	 Tom, Eric, Daren and Gary, Attached below is a file that I have put together detailing out a proposal for gas to CoServ (natural gas distribution unit of Denton County Electric Cooperative).  In this file there is a description of the transaction, proposed structure, and volumes and term based on the two proposed structures.    The second file is the actual one page proposal sent by CoServ.    This proposal is due Wednesday and I need to get offers for index and fixed price term intrastate gas for baseload volumes delivered at the Katy, Waha, and Carthage Lonestar connections.  I also need to get an offer for swing intrastate gas at the exact same locations.   Shout at me if you have questions or if we need to discuss this further. Thanks, JD

farmer-d	 As individuals involved in the day-to-day oversight and management of PPEP's Cleburne facility, it's important that you are familiar with and follow the covenants set out under the purchase agreement signed with Mesquite Investors, LLC (an El Paso affiliate) on September 7.  Those covenants are contained in Section 5.4 of the purchase agreement, which is attached for your reference.  The covenants are fairly self-explanatory.  However, if you have any questions concerning their interpretation or implementation, please contact Joe Henry at (713) 345-1549 or me at (713) 853-6027.  Thanks,  RH

farmer-d	  The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday. To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund. Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.  How to Help ?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on "Disaster Relief"  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666.   ?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.    ?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100.   ?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of "National Prayer and Remembrance," and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information:   o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/>  o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/> o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.   o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information.    ?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.    ?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.    ?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.  For Counseling Assistance ?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391.   ?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.  This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

farmer-d	 Hi Daren, Bryan Hull gave me your name.  A customer was interested in trading Intrastate Gas and Bryan had informed me that our Exxon-Katy location is intrastate.  I was wondering if you would be interested in changing the long description on EOL for this location to include the phrase intrastate gas so that any customers that are interested would be able to see that.

OPENING PRAYER -- KANSAS STATE SENATE Thought you might enjoy this interesting prayer given in KANSAS at the opening session of their Senate. It seems prayer still upsets some people.  When Minister Joe Wright was asked to open the new session of the KANSAS SENATE, everyone was expecting the usual generalities, but this is what they heard:  " Heavenly Father, we come before you today to ask your forgiveness and to seek your direction and guidance.  We know Your Word says, "Woe to those who call evil good", but that is exactly what we have done.  We have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed our values.  We confess that.  We have ridiculed the absolute truth of Your Word and called it Pluralism.  We have exploited the poor and called it the lottery,  We have rewarded laziness and called it welfare,  We have killed our unborn and called it choice,  We have shot abortionists and called it justifiable,  We have neglected to discipline our children and called it building self-esteem,  We have abused power and called it politics,  We have coveted our neighbor's possessions and called it ambition,  We have polluted the air with profanity and pornography and called it freedom of statement,  We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our forefathers and called it enlightenment.  Search us, Oh, God, and know our hearts today; cleanse us from every sin and set us free.  Guide and bless these men and women who have been sent to direct us to the center of Your will and to openly ask these things in the name of Your Son, the living Savior, Jesus Christ.  " Amen.!! "  The response was immediate. A number of legislators walked out during the prayer in protest.  In 6 short weeks, Central Christian Church, where Rev. Wright is pastor, logged more than 5,000 phone calls with only 47 of those calls responding negatively.  The church is now receiving international requests for copies of this prayer from India, Africa, and Korea. Commentator Paul Harvey aired this prayer on his radio program, " The Rest of the Story ", and received a larger response to this program than any other he has ever aired. With the Lord's help, may this prayer sweep over our nation and wholeheartedly become our desire so that we again can be called, " one nation under God. " If possible, please pass this prayer on to your friends.  Think about this: If you forward this prayer to everyone on your email list in less than 30 days it would be heard by the world.  __________________________________________________ Terrorist Attacks on U.S. - How can you help?

farmer-d	 Darren,  I joined Brian Redmond on his visit a few weeks ago to Sid Richardson.  During that visit SR indicated that they have firm Lone Star transport that they want to sell (only details I know at this time is that it is 45MM/D point to point on a true firm basis).  I believe we could use this transport to back stop the Falcon transaction (parking gas in their facility Oct/Nov 01 - Jan 04).  I spoke with the folks at SR today and indicated that we want to know more details about the sale to see if we could garner interest internally.  They gave me the name of a person in their shop who would be right person to talk to about the details.  I understand you would be the right person to a). bounce this idea off of and b). if there is an interest on this transport I presume you would be the best person to get the details on this transport from SR.    The name of the person to talk to at SR is Scott Walker (817.810.9385).  I'd like to touch base with about this.  Thanks Miguel E.

farmer-d	 Darren: I am working with Jim Pond to clean up the UA4 that has been booked to Cleburne since the beginning of the deal.  We are starting with November 2000.  Gas accounting has booked 21,309 MMBtu as UA4 for November, which is related to deal 502861 on the Texas desk.  It looks like we took some of the gas we purchased from Williams (deal 384237) on the Cleburne desk and moved it to ENA's transport contract with deal 502861.  The print screen below shows the deal from Zone transport to ENA-Texas.  I think we need a deal from Cleburne to Zone Transport to complete to deal path and clean up the UA4.  Can you review the deals for November and let me know what you think?  Jim says there is UA4 every month of this deal and this may be the reason.  I will have to check each month.

To fill a Top of Stack order in Stack Manager, Right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of Stack Manager and select fill. ?	The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides.  ?	The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume. ?	Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.  Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)  You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.  Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)  Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions - ?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it. ?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.  Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.  Savita ( X 31787)

farmer-d	 NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  Breaking News : posted Sep 26, 4:16 PM Proposed Rule Extends Marketing Affiliate Regulations to All Affiliates  Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners Wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers, including both natural gas pipelines and power lines, to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate.  Previously, the rules simply required creation of a firewall, including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel, between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates. The proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate, gas or electric, including financial affiliates.  The Commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates, which still in many cases have bundled operations. One option would enforce complete separation, while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load. Staff and Commissioners Wood, William Massey and Nora Brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel, so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non-affiliated competitors did not have access to.  Commissioner Linda Breathitt, however, argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load. Breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities, she was concerned about the timing. "I see no compelling reason at this time; there have been no complaints and no evidence." She said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction. "I agree with concept philosophically, but I think there will be other opportunities later on, after we do a little more bridge-building with state commissions."  Wood said he understood "the political issue here with respect to federal-state relations, but I think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated." Staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems, waivers could be granted. Staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel. "If I am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load, I can go into the control room and get all the information I want," one staffer responded.  Wood proposed, and the commissioners ratified, a proposed rule with no exceptions, but which makes clear that in the final rule the Commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required. Commenting parties should provide cost/benefit analysis on both sides of the question. State commissions are also invited to comment. Wood had suggested the Commission extend the separation to all sales employees, "but make it clear that if we don't hear from people that they really want this separation, we ain't going to do it."

farmer-d	 	There is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we've all witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks, but when you look at the following numbers and realize how much worse it could've been, I guess there are a lot of people who were saved. . .     			Subject: The odds are against them  			By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise and reports of the 			destruction from the terrorist attacks on the US. These were deplorable 			acts 			that we will never forget. But now is a time to look at the other side of 			the 			numbers coming out of New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. The sad 			but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream media has not reported yet 			  - the SURVIVAL rates and some positive news about the attacks.  			*** The Buildings ***  			* The World Trade Center - 			The twin towers of the World Trade Center were places of employment for 			some 			50,000 people. With the missing list of just over 5,000 people, that means 			90% of the people targeted survived the attack. A 90% on a test is an 'A'.  			* The Pentagon - 			Some 23,000 people were the target of a third plane aimed at the Pentagon. 			The latest count shows that only 123 lost their lives. That is an amazing 			99.5% survival rate. in addition, the plane seems to have come in too low, 			too early to affect a large portion of the building. On top of that, the 			section that was hit was the first of five sections to undergo renovations 			that would help protect the Pentagon from terrorist attacks. It had 			recently 			completed straightening and blastproofing, saving untold lives. This attack 			was sad, but a statistical failure.  			*** The Planes ***  			* American Airlines Flight 77 			This Boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of the Pentagon could have 			carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard. Luckily 78% of the seats 			were empty.  			* American Airlines Flight 11 			This Boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people aboard, but only carried 			92. 			Thankfully 74% of the seats were unfilled.  			* United Airlines Flight 175 			Another Boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people only had 65 people on 			board. Fortunately it was 81% empty.  			* United Airlines Flight 93 			This Boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting stories yet. The smallest 			flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out of a possible 289 had 			84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood up to the attackers and 			thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a national landmark, saving 			untold numbers of lives in the process.  			*** In Summary *** 			Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly targeted by these inept 			cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's a higher survival rate 			than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney transplants and liver transplants 			- all common, survivable illnesses.  			The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon was hit at it's 			strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people in the World Trade 			Center buildings escaped, and a handful of passengers gave the ultimate 			sacrifice to save even more lives.  			Pass this information on to those in fear and the media. Don't fear these 			terrorists. The odds are against them.

We can setup a confidentiality agreement if you want, that would probably allow us to discuss storage options in the area more freely.  Since you are out today I'll see if I can't get Rick Moncrief to send over a form of Agreement we have used, they all look pretty similar.  As far as deal structure I'm pretty open on how we setup, but am definitely interested in equity partnership/JV.  As this is our core area of assets we wish to continue to be actively involved in deals that we believe add value. I believe there is significant potential to create a trading platform utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity SRES's system supply could create at an expanded Waha Hub.

I talked with Dave Nommensen, and according to=  him, what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate = paths out there which is why they put this code in place???  From a schedul= ing perspective, my understanding of what your main concern is to just main= tain your position and be able to change it.  If you were overpathed, you'd=  see it in the Path Manager either way. [Pinion, Richard]    To restate the=  question for clarity, in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply, mar= ket and a service, adds any up/downstream contract information and/or Duns = or DRN override and then saves it.  Unify looks for an old path with those = exact variables and if it finds it re-uses it and if it does not find an ex= act match creates a new path and path id.  I had been told that to do away = with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since = any path once nominated on could not be deleted.  Has this changed???  At o= ne time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity=  number match for nominations.  Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that ne= eded the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they wer= e used.  I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs = this to occur.  Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number = cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected= .  Therefore, if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify, I = don't think that this constant old path look up is needed.   [Kinsey, Lisa]=    Get rid of this. =20  2)  The scheduling position window:  does anyone use this?  If not, we'll r= emove the code logic that populates this window.  I have never seen a sched= uler use this.  Please verify. [Pinion, Richard]   Originally such a window=  was in use by everyone in the legacy system "Autonoms" so it was duplicate= d in Unify by request.  It is not used in Unify now because of the other so= phisticated tools Unify provides which obviate it's use.

If they do need this information, we=  could provide it, but if not, I'd prefer to remove the functionality. [Pin= ion, Richard]    This function is still very much in use by those with poin= t based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing = nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pat= hed through the same contract imbalance pool.  Keep it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Ye= s.  We use this functionality a lot when pathing pools.=09=20  4)  When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths, what's the aver= age number of paths they create at one time?  What about updates?  I know t= hat ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packa= ges of gas that they are limited in size to.  Does the system seem faster w= hen you update one record at a time or chunks of records?  My real question=  is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and=  Inserts.  By update, I mean, going to the path list and changing an upstre= am / downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be cr= eated. [Pinion, Richard]    This one to many or many to one pathing goes on=  every day on every pipeline.  There is no 'average'.  They typically updat= e a path with up/downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time how= ever.  I hope this answers your question.  I see no change to this process = at this time  [Kinsey, Lisa]  On some pipes this function is used more than=  others.  When it is used we try and do as many paths as possible.  At this=  time I do not see a need to change this process. =09=20  5)  On brokered paths, do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Se= rvice?  In other words, when updating Brokered arrangements, we don't incor= porate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangm= ent link and hence sending it to be renominated?  Why do we do this for ser= vice?  Is it because we have to renominate it?  I assume that's what it's f= or since we don't send brokered paths to the pipe.  Anyway, with the Nomlog= ic implmentation (two way interface), we were planning on having it behave = the same way as service.  We need this verified. [Pinion, Richard]    We do= n't perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominat= ed to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pi= peline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path.

farmer-d	 Since Lisa used fuchsia, I'll use lavender..  On # 1 I would eliminate that processing. In addition, can we delete/hide/n= ot access old paths that haven't been used in gas production in lets say a = year or so. Would this help performance?  This would also force the schedul= ers to path/think about the way they are pathing their transactions and not=  rely on old paths that may no longer be accurate!! We've seen old bad, zer= o paths be re-used accidentally. On # 2, The scheduling position window IS the weakest link.....GOODBYE! On # 3, Contract Reference I know is used alot in the supply and market lis= t. Nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comme= nts. Do we need it in the inventory list?  Probably not as much as the supp= ly and market list but I still believe it's necessary for pools and imbalan= ce accounts.=20 On # 4, We use this functionality alot on CGAS, TENN, TRCO and SAB...When w= e path one to many or many to one in "chunks," it does seem to go faster th= an one path at a time. On # 5,  Brokered paths could really just be slammed in there. No need for = the extra processing that occurs for service contracts .

farmer-d	  Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.   We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.   If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.   Thank you for your support.   Enron Global Technology       -----Original Message-----  From: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration  Sent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM  To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON  Cc:  Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses    Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.  Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.  To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.  IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.  We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.  Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.   Enron Messaging Administration 
farmer-d	 Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.  The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below:   ?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur. ?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume. ?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.  Please see example below:  Parent's Settings: Minimum: 	5000 Increment:  1000  Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged 1      - 2499							0 2500 - 5499							5000 5500 - 6499							6000

Below is a screen print of what April 2001 looks like.  When you had previously attempted to set this meter up, I believe it wouldn't let you because of one (or both?) of the contracts being canceled or expired.  I have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact Global Counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract(s) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system.  As I am unfamiliar with this process and the Global Counterparty personnel, I do not have a contact for you.  Hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past.  Since this is a call-out meter, I can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for May 2001.  In case you need to enter them, the volume should be as follows:  Contract 012-41500-05-002 	HPL 		Injection     16,149 Contract 012-88494-05-001 	TX Genl Land 	Withdrawal 16,149   I have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of October if at all possible, therefore, your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated.

farmer-d	  If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.  We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.    We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.    Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.    As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance.   For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins. 
farmer-d	   NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : October 26, 2001 Enbridge Buys Koch's East Texas Midstream Assets for $231M  Enbridge Energy Partners LP is buying gas gathering, treating, processing and transmission assets in East Texas from Koch Midstream Services for $230.5 million. The package includes all of the East Texas System, which gathers 400 MMcf/d for delivery into the Carthage Hub.  Enbridge Energy Company President Dan C. Tutcher said the assets are a "natural fit" with Enbridge's existing Texas assets and will significantly expand the company's "geographic footprint" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix. "We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership's distributable cash flow, and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the East Texas System.''  Enbridge Partners will acquire 1,880 miles of various diameter gathering lines, 37 compressor stations, four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 MMcf/d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 MMcf/d. The transaction is anticipated to close in December.  The intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase, transportation and resale of natural gas. Additionally, when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive, the option exists to extract NGLs from purchased gas, thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue, the company noted. The partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy.  It forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400-420 MMcf/d in 2002. Based on this estimate, the acquisition would contribute incremental EBITDA of between $26 million and $32 million for the year, while distributable cash flow would increase by between $0.10 and $0.15 per unit, with further improvements anticipated in 2003. The forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50% debt and 50% equity, in line with Enbridge Partners target long-term capital structure.  Enbridge Partners also reported third quarter net income of $6.6 million, or $0.13 per common unit, compared with net income of $14.2 million, or $0.42 per unit, for the third quarter in 2000. The decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $5.4 million. The adjustment was the result of what Enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process, as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications.  Third quarter deliveries were 1,208 million b/d compared to 1,272 MMb/d for the same period in the prior year. The partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year, to average between 1.30 and 1.33 MMb/d. However, its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil, which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude. For 2002, growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full-year average deliveries to between 1.35 and 1.43 MMb/d.  "The partnership's forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes, which have languished for the past several quarters, will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002," said Tutcher. "The major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in Western Canada. We also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy, which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income. The partnership's primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders. To that end, we are confident that the acquisition of the East Texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002.''

farmer-d	 Daren,  Sherlyn Schumack suggested that I contact you with this matter.  I am working on some old HPL issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up, #208101, but this deal was subsequently killed (no reason found).  This deal was copied from #205533 which was good through 2/29/00.  Please set up a valid deal for March 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby HPL is buying gas from ENA on Tejas at the same points.  This deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to Reliant Energy.  Please note that Reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made.

Historically, HPLC has always purchased the gas at this meter from Four Square, but it doesn't look like a deal was ever entered for May.  The April deal number was 695469.  Did HPLC purchase this gas in May?   Megan 
farmer-d	 Sorry bout the first comment, did not totally understand... We will handle this via the OA process, where I'm working with the OA group that will allow us a bucket of income or loss and we will run this through Tom's P&L... This will be a pass through for Tom's book... O    -----Original Message----- From: 	Farmer, Daren J.   Sent:	Wednesday, October  31, 2001 2:43 PM To:	Winfree, O'Neal D.

Cc:	Bryan, Gary; Pond, Jim; Helton, Susan; East, Laynie; Roberts, Linda Subject:	RE: TGLO Status  Megan  As I mentioned to you yesterday, it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to TX GLO do not have Linda Robert's origination fee deducted.  Do we need to execute a PMA with TXGLO to deduct those volumes from the next delievery?  Also isn't there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to TXGLO?  Is that being captured in Unify or is it being manually entered by Gas Accounting?  Darren Do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct?  Susan/Laynie What busines unit are these cost centers rolling up to (11814 & 27117?)   << File: TGLO GL Account Detail.xls >>      -----Original Message----- From: 	Parker, Megan   Sent:	Tuesday, October 30, 2001 9:06 AM To:	Boyt, Eric Cc:	Newman, Frank G.; Coffey Jr., Jim Subject:	TGLO Status  Eric: I reviewed the gas deals on Franks' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in Sitara.  As soon as I have the October gas numbers, I will forward them to you.  Attached is a spreadsheet of the TGLO deals booked to the GL to help you with our current settlement position.  It is divided by debit/credit entries.  When the sales are booked, a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account (40004000 third party; 40005000 intercompany) for the profit center.    Below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to EGM.  I have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book Aug and Sept crude.  I will wait for the go ahead from Frank before I final them to the GL.    Let me know if you have any questions.

I just want your opinion on something.  One of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a  senior analyst or third year analyst.  It is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase.  In no way do I want to imply greed, or that I will only stay for money, but if in your opinion I may be deserving of this, then maybe we could run it by Bob or the program, or whoever is in control of that.

farmer-d	  Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The information provides further details about:  	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge; 	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications; 	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties;  	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and 	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.  This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.    Restatement of Earnings  Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:  Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:  	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997 	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998 	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999  	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000 	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001  	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001 	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.    The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.  The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.  You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.  We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments. 
farmer-d	  Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.  Deal Terms  --	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing. --	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas. --   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. --   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.  Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.  Management of Newly Formed Company  Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.  I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.  Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.  The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.  As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.  I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.  I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.  And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.   Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.  In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

farmer-d	  As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.  Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.  I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.  Thank you. 
farmer-d	 Matt / Ben:  I am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up Unify response and retrieve times.    Based on my interviews of various desks including AEP and Calgary and our recent discussions, we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month (requirements contracts on wellhead gas).  Following is a recap of what is PROPOSED to be done regarding zero path termination.  1.  All paths that are zero on the last day of a month  (exception noted in #2 below)  will terminate on that day and WILL NO LONGER roll into the following month. 	This path termination out function will run every night.  Any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month's paths UNLESS a volume  	is on that path in the future month.  2.  Zero Paths marked as "always send nominations" WILL CONTINUE to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option.  It appears that HPL 	(736 paths) and NIGAS (1136 paths) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to.  A special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the 	scheduler when you are ready.  3.  Zero paths which roll from month to month using the "Volume Management - Do Not Send" function will CEASE to do so.  This was agree to by Patti in regards to  	paths for OBA tracking.  ALL: Please respond via e-mail with any comments.  Richard  x37339

farmer-d	      Mike:    I am down to the last few error messages on the EPGT Quick Response and also looking into the external pool for WH034 in Unify.  About 70% of the line items have been cleaned up.    I need the following information from you as soon as possible.       1.  The downstream contract number for Aquila Marketing and a "scheduled quantity report" for the Pooling contract WH034, this is the report you would obtain from the pipeline at the end of each cycle to determine cuts etc. or you can give me the user id and password    and I can go pull it myself.    The EPGT's IT group is trying to research the correct DUNS # for Aquila Dallas Marketing.  If this issue is not resolved, I am planning on setting up a meeting with EL Paso on November 26th at 1:30 at their offices and I would like for you to go with me. We will meet with their IT and Business Group for about an hour or so.   Your prompt attention to this will be greatly appreciated.            Thank you.         Shane Lakho

farmer-d	 Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.    ?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.  ?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.    To move funds: On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu. On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts." This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.  To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Included in the payment to AEP is a deduction for the sale of the Centana storage gas.  We are selling them 1,236,286 MMBTU @ $2.375 for a total of $2,936,179.25.  The sale is for September, 2001 production.  We will need a deal put in Sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics.  However, there is only 1,195,754 MMBTU on report 006 in Unify (for contracts 96018371, 96014189, and 96019236).  How do we account for this volumetic difference?  Connie will be truing up the GL to match the current Unify volume.  The GL was short approx. 18,000 MMBTU because a beginning balance was not booked.    This needs to happen before the upcoming close.  Thanks for you help in this matter.  Please let me know of any concerns.

My home address is:  4501 Shetland   Houston  77027 As for the cancellation of the corporate phones, that is not scheduled to take place yet, and may not right away. If they just want to do a rate plan change, then they can do it via email (have them email me) or they can indicate it on their contract that they fill out to change liability. The main thing to do is to fill out the contract to change liability, which also obligates them for one year. As for the balances accrued up to date, they are not responsible for those.  Enron is.

farmer-d	  Ho ho ho, we're around to that most  wonderful time of the year---NEON leaders retreat time!   I know that  this time of year is extremely  hectic, and that it's tough to think about anything past the holidays, but life  does go on past the week of December 25 through January 1, and that's what I'd  like you to think about for a minute.   On the calender that I handed out at the beginning  of the fall semester, the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of January  5-6.  But because of a youth ministers conference that Brad and Dustin are  connected with that week, we're going to change the date to the following  weekend, January 12-13.  Now comes the part you need to think  about.   I think we all agree that it's important for us to  get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far  into the spring semester, but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult  for us to get away without kids, etc.  So, Brad came up with a potential  alternative for how we can get together on that weekend, and then you can let me  know which you prefer.   The first option would be to have a  retreat similar to what we've done the past several years.  This year  we could go to the Heartland Country Inn (www.heartlandcountryinn.com )  outside of Brenham.  It's a nice place, where we'd have a 13-bedroom  and a 5-bedroom house side by side.  It's in the country, real relaxing,  but also close to Brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from  here.  We can golf, shop in the antique and craft stores in Brenham, eat  dinner together at the ranch, and spend time with each other.  We'd meet on  Saturday, and then return on Sunday morning, just like what we've done in the  past.   The second option would be to stay here in  Houston, have dinner together at a nice restaurant, and then have dessert  and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that Saturday  evening.  This might be easier, but the trade off would be that we wouldn't  have as much time together.  I'll let you decide.   Email me back with what would be your preference,  and of course if you're available on that weekend.  The democratic process  will prevail--majority vote will rule!  Let me hear from you as soon as  possible, preferably by the end of the weekend.  And if the vote doesn't go  your way, no complaining allowed (like I tend to do!)   Have a great weekend, great golf, great fishing,  great shopping, or whatever makes you happy!   Bobby

farmer-d	  To:		All Enron Employees  From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr. 		EVP, Finance & Treasurer  Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement   Post-Petition Expenses  Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.  Pre-Petition Expenses  We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.  We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.  Thank you for your patience.

farmer-d	 Wanted to share the latest communication on NETCO. This is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward. I will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below.   For a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the NETCO team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown. I know you took a preliminary look at this but I want you all to rethink and give me a "final or startup" list. The list you gave me on the contracts required for NETCO on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed. I believe we need to take a look at some of the Intrastates and key LDC's and get that info on the list. Seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6. I'll try and get some details today. Don't know if we will be allocated spots on 6. IT systems layout and structure is already being planned/discussed. Most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture.  In addition any other items for a re-start that you can think of please forward to me.   Of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once/if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase. Let's be optimistic and hope they are interested in the NETCO structure that has been laid out. Regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready.  Thanks - Bob  The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.  The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-  (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	 	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.   	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	 (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen  	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. 	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence 	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. 
farmer-d	 Listed below are some guidelines for gathering the necessary information for NETCO contract setup so we can get as much done as possible prior to our start date. I suggest each manager start making the phone calls and if necessary get others at the desk to help out. Again, the goal is to get hard copies of the contracts in our hands for review so we can fill out all of the necessary information ahead of time. Take good notes on the questions that come up when speaking with the pipes. We can get legal involved as needed when major issues surface.   Please let me know if you have any further questions, tks - Bob  -----Original Message----- From: 	Calcagno, Suzanne   Sent:	Wednesday, January 02, 2002 4:33 PM To:	Superty, Robert Subject:	FW:         Hi All-  Attached above is the master list of contracts we'll need for Day 1 of NEWCO.  As the footnotes indicate, we'll also need new business party ID's/passwords, an EBB agreement for all pipes and a TPA for each EDI pipe (Tammy & I will be working on TPA's and EBB's).  The timing indicated assumes that we have a clear NEWCO structure, that the NEWCO credit status has been identified, and that a DUNS number has been established.  The two week estimate is built on working through the pipelines' credit process as an entirely new entity and on turning the contracts through Legal on each end, so it may be shorter for some of the simpler agreements but in any event we should estimate at least 3-5 days even for pooling agreements.  For the LDC's and intrastates, we'll need to specifically identify what each requires.  As we discussed, we need to call each pipeline and identify the following information:  Pipeline contact name and number (I know some of you sent me this b/f--but pls make sure that it's the legal/regulatory contact, not your business counterpart) Credit requirements for a NEW entity with an "A" credit rating (they may just refer you to the tariff, if so, pls. ask them for a specific site so we can do the research) Get a sense of the reaction of the pipe/LDC regarding credit for the new entity--we can set up a discussion between our legal and theirs so we can resolve those issues and move forward to contracting. in the event that any of them raise the issue of paying any of the old Enron bills, just reiterate that we're setting up a completely new entity and give them Bob's, mine, or Jeff Hodge's name to discuss the estate issues. If there are different requirements for different service levels (ie, pooling vs. IT vs. FT), pls ask them to specify so that we can get the easier agreements in place first and get business started on the pipe. We need to get a hard copy of the contract for each service level--pls. ask the pipe/LDC to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it.  Once we have those together, I'll run the traps with Legal.  It would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier, then work on the second.  I will be out of the office Thursday & Friday, but please call me on my cell phone at 713-516-2574 with any questions.  Thanks, Suzanne

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES      NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) expects at least two bidders to come in Monday with offers to jump-start the energy company's trading operations.  "We expect bids today. Probably two or more," said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer who represents Enron in its bankruptcy proceedings in New York.  Bienenstock declined to identify possible bidders.  But a person familiar with the matter said that Citigroup (C), one of Enron's main creditors, would likely be among those bidding for Enron's trading assets.  Bids are due by 4 p.m. EST Monday.

farmer-d	 NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  Breaking News : posted Jan 9, 2:28 PM Dynegy Not Opposed to Enron Auction; Senate Subcommittee to Issue 51 Subpoenas  Nearly 20 of bankrupt Enron Corp.'s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company's trading assets this week, but one-time merger partner and creditor Dynegy Corp. will not be one of them, a spokesman said Wednesday. However, whether the auction proceeds as planned, Enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued Friday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for Enron's trading business, once the most profitable unit of the company. The motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale. Included in the auction are assets from its EnronOnline operation, which Enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash-rich company.  Under Enron's proposal, a 51% joint venture partner would form a new company with Enron to be called New Energy Trading Co., or NETCO. Enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things, in exchange for a 49% stake. As of late Monday, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and BP had made bids for some of the assets.  Among those opposing the auction, now set for Thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as Friday, is the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, which said, "Absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale, the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate, appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries." Kansas City, MO-based Aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used. Aquila wants the auction's proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of Enron receive the money.  However, Dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction, said company spokesman Steve Stengel, who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it. "Dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of Enron's trading business," he told NGI. Stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of Northern Natural Gas Co. from Enron to Dynegy is still set to close by the end of January.  Still to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The subpoenas will be served on Enron, its accounting firm Andersen and 49 individual officers, employees and members of the board of directors. The subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice.  "The subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members, the role of the auditors, and the role of special-purpose entities," a subcommittee spokesman told Reuters. These are some of the same types of things being investigated by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, the Senate Commerce Committee and the House and Senate Energy committees. The spokesman said the subpoenas would allow Enron and the others "several weeks" to respond.

We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.  2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.

farmer-d	 OK, since we don't appear to be able to hook up by phone...  With respect to (1), if ENA can't effectively manage the plant's positions, who can you recommend that could under the same terms?  As you recall, the equity owners do have a buyer interested in the asset, so the arrangement would probably be short-term at best.  I think the bank that has collateral rights to the asset will be concerned with the payable.  With respect to (2), did your discussions with Legal lead to any conclusions with respect to compensating the project?  What is the amount of the claim the project has back to ENA?  I agree that the project should make payments directly to the suppliers and Lone Star.  I'm around, give me a call if you get a chance.  RH   -----Original Message----- From: 	Farmer, Daren J.
