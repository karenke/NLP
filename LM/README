I have extracted the text content from the TRAINING files of the four data set and use python NLTK to get the tokens and 
generate the Bigrams in the folder ./data/bigrams
They are in the format: <bigrams> : occurrence, and the start and ending of the sentence is marked as "START xxxx" "xxx END".

her problems : 3
drawings END : 1
his unusual : 1
disc should : 1
various dramas : 1
whatsoever it : 1
priest jon : 1
miller meant : 1
she complains : 1
final transformation : 1
START appearing : 1
a vindicated : 1


BTW, I have removed some punctuation such as "" , . ? ! .etc
Not sure whether there is still some bugs in the bigrams since it's so big data that I cannot check it all. 


I only use ReadFile.java in src and read.py in data folder.
