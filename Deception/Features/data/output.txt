0,0,Swissotelchicago – I could go food here. Their steak cooked way I like I good dining experience every night. Some waitresses talked much; friendly stories people country. I really enjoyed restaurant steps room; pretty much interested me. I didn’t fly way Chicago food. Maybe I missed something; seemed like everything else off. The concierge told I could walk Grand Park minutes; took almost half hour. I see really cool birds seagulls way; I didn’t know he’d say closer is? And walls really thin. I could hear giggling wall opposite bed night long. And reason; weren’t outlets near bed; I leave phone across room near sink outlet charge night. It made using alarm next day little annoying… I’m sure company recommended place; maybe I got bad room?
0,1,For Top Class Treatment Choose Hotel Allegro. In years buisness travel vacationing; I never happy service hotel I Hotel Allegro. I searched many hotel websites looking perfect hotel spend honeymoon; Hotel Allegro seemed like right choice. Soon I walked elaborate lobby area; like I big shot Wallstreet; service excellent best part; allow animals. They treated little dog Johnny like royalty. They everything could ever need hotel; room spa service workout center. They even made sure I drinks amentites ready Monday night Bears game. If I give rate 1 - 10. Id give 10 many times over. I highly recommend Hotel Allegro Chicago Illinois I back again.
0,0,There great difference Hyatt Regency Hotel; normal hotel. The thing I like hotel smoke section non smoking section really close other. I get really uncomfortable I crowded area; people smoking lungs out. Even though hotel really glamourous; nice bar; nice restaurant; great music; still good stay don't like people smoking beside you.
1,1,We went Chicago see exhibit Art Institute selected Fairmont close. Although lobby still renovated; experience hotel uniformly positive. The room nicely sized newly remodeled immaculate. The glitch involved getting room coffee replenished. The maid that; bedtime first night; still didn't coffee. We called front desk immediately delivered fresh supply. The restaurant little underwhelming; many places go within blocks; probably wouldn't eaten did. After stayed close dozen different Chicago hotels; may hotel return whenever return.
0,0,I booked reservations The Talbott Hotel hopes finding luxury excellent service. What I actually got far less that. When I first arrived check in; woman desk impolite looked rather bored. It took 5 minutes even find reservation computer system! And I won't go detail messed room keys give second set! When I finally got room; first thing I noticed smelled stale. The air room literally smelled like room; without fresh air; years. I soon discovered bathroom toilet leak; well; every time flushed toilet; water would trickle base onto floor. Talk concerning. I reported desk; fellow answered promised someone would right away fix it. No one showed next day; early morning; I might add. Later; I called room service asked bottle wine. It took half hour deliver room! And wasn't even chilled time showed up; either; lukewarm. Overall; experience pleasant; I don't recommend booking hotel.
0,0,Although InterContinental Chicago Hotel located "The Magnificent Mile;" entire experience guests anything ....believe me; "magnificence" ends hotel entrance! From check-in check-out; impressions ranged lackluster horrific. First; error reservation; got room; found neither phone internet connection worked; I trudged registration desk--where I wait line least twenty minutes--to ask help. The first night spent nearly totally sleepless due TV noise coming next room; weren't sure whether due excessively inconsiderate neighbors thin walls. Then; dog tired next morning--even though hung "Do Not Disturb" sign door handle--in barged maid bright-eyed bushy tailed scrubber hand. Following rude awakening; I jarred blood-curdling shriek wife; who; upon entering bathroom take shower; greeted incredibly large roach! Breakfast--actually meals partook hotel--were served cold somewhat tasteless. We routinely ignored concierge; always seems personal call whenever needed him. Trying leave hotel equally difficult checking in. Of course; gross error bill caused us delayed effort depart. Getting InterContinental Chicago was; believe me; best part experience guests there.
0,1,Last week I stayed Hilton Chicago 4 days 3 nights I pleased experience. As soon I approached front desk; I knew right away staff friendly courteous. They given list local attractions Museum Science Industry; Broadcast Museum; Ford Center For The Performing Arts Willis Tower. I stayed junior suite included king size bed; 27 inch television; non-allergenic feather pillows variety amenities. The indoor pool rather large well gym includes countless treadmills even jogging track. Eating area problem Hilton Chicago home Kitty O'Sheas restaurant offering authentic Irish fare. In conclusion; I wonderful time staying I wait plan return trip Hilton Chicago.
1,0,The Good - excellent location; neighborhood pretty quiet; close shops; restaurants; waterfront; close train/subway station; etc The Bad - Very old decor; isn't big deal; tv smaller PC monitor. We supposed king bed (anniversary trip) given two double beds told would switched - never happened. The shower/tub stopped bad I showered husband waited one hour tub drain could shower. Who wants shower someone else's dirty water even wife. The indifferent - room decent size; bed linens okay; staff mediocre marginally rude
0,1,We amazed hotel. The first great part location. Its close great shopping city offer. The view terrace suite night breathtaking looking Chicago. They even florist; I bought wife rose. The menus; lobby; everything fantastic. The room clean arrived every time came back day. I didn't use fitness center looked nice; I however visit bar....and return Chicago; I again.
0,0,I disappointed stay The James. I strict gluten free diet told hotel restaurant could accomodate needs. Each time I sat meal; I would explain dietary needs waiter. Most times; I ended send plate back gluten item included. My wife sleep apnea made reservations; I made sure ask room available outlet near bed could plug CPAP machine. I assured problem. However; arrived hotel; request room change outlet near bed. We wait lobby sometime room moved yet finished benig cleaned. Overall; entirely horrific stay; I expected hotel supposed caliber. Next time I visit Chicago; I staying another hotel.
0,1,Hilton Chicago - I would say Hilton Chicago one best hotel Iâ€™ve ever stayed. When I first entered hotel; I amazed luxurious decoration lobby welcoming staff help check in. The receptionist thoughtful put room 10th floor I could enjoy splendid view Michigan Lake. When I walked room; I really impressed size layout room. I spent evening watching sports enjoying sunset lake. How beat that! The location hotel also perfect since lots nice restaurants bars within walking distance itâ€™s nice take walk around area dinner. In all; I loved Hilton Chicago would recommend anyone plan spend great night Chicago!
1,1,I large; roomy; clean 2 bed room large bathroom; big minibar snack assortment tucked away nicely corner hall noise. Customer Service absolutely incredible; doorman front desk; gentleman delivered toothpaste room I requested it. Sure; get little outside noise; big city; unusual! I really enjoyed stay strongly recommend it.
0,0,I recently displeasure staying Conrad Chicago. Although hotel came recommendations various online websites; experience anything pleasent. First all; tell check time 3pm. Well I arrived hotel 3:30pm checked discover room ready. After waiting nearly hour room ready; I decided go settle in. The carpets room smelled old musty. Additionally; bathroom cleanest states numerous noticeable chips; scratches; dents furniture. Although bed comfortable; I couldn't get musty smell coming carpet. It difficult get air conditioning set comfortable temperature I good nights sleep. All all; experience worst I've ever had; far anything worth writing home about.
0,0,Hotel located 1/2 mile train station quite hike you're traveling luggage and/or kids. They seem cash guests arrive private car charging exorbitant parking/valet fees. Rooms feature either double king sized beds; queen beds all. If want little extra leg room bed; price jump double- king-sized stiff. Rooms kind view pay healthy surcharge; too.
1,1,I recently stayed Fairmont Chicago found fantastic hotel. Staff always courteous helpful - front desk staff check-in wait staff Aria restaurant; maid cleaned room. The rooms recently updated; large flat-screen TV's; beautiful linens; exceptional toiletries room. My room even view Monroe St. harbor. It truly first-rate hotel. Location south river east Michigan Ave -- normally stay north river seems little way (if that's possible downtown Chicago); however location significantly lowers street noise. The hotel excellent access Millennium Park; Aon center (there connecting concourse); 4 blocks shopping North Michigan Ave. I ate dinner Aria fantastic! Room service breakfast quite good well. Overall; I'd stay minute I business loop; leisure plans Millennium Grant Parks.
1,0,Great; awesome service. Seriously; people amazing. That; nice bartender serves last call (at least; that's I told - I course don't drink) save place one star. But seriously blah; small; non-luxury rooms beds really uncomfortable - card rate $725/night; even major city; rooms better awesome. I've waaaay better rooms NYC $350/night. (Good thing I corporate rate.) And room especially big; despite reviews say. But here's main problem. Even 10th floor; guy blowing whistle summon cabs downstairs woke 6; 6:15; 6:30; 6:45; 6:50; 6:55; and...and; well; I finally got said screw it; let's greet day. Maybe everyone else already up; somehow I doubt it. Am safely ensconced Four Seasons.
0,0,I really expecting lot quality chain like Sheraton; recent stay downtown location Chicago somewhat disappointment. It started check in; I specifically requested room single king-size bed; told front desk uncertain terms (OK; rather rudely!) banker's convention going on; I happy double-bed room left. It I could get lousy drink voucher inconvenience! The room OK; nothing special though. The cleaning staff must've through; faint aroma old washrags still air. The internet jack wasn't working. It took two hours maintenance guy come fix it; apologies given. For price; I really expected way customer service Sheraton. I guess they're really better anyone else days!
1,1,I love free breakfast dinners weeknights. The hotel clean nice rooms The pool needs updating(but kids don't care) My friend I took granddaughters grandma grandaughter outing hotel perfect
0,0,Sheraton Chicago - Do let decor lobby fool you; rooms Sheraton match up. I stayed two nights; I ask two room changes: first room faulty shower; second seemed process cleaning I entered. I also big fan unnecessary extra furniture room: uncomfortable chair arranged one barely see television blasted face air conditioning. On top that; $199 night rate include free internet; something I feel commonplace nowadays. The restaurants downstairs alright; one definitely get better even lower price outside; especially downtown Chicago. While Sheraton may pretty good reputation across country; Sheraton Chicago meet expectations; I would recommend staying elsewhere.
0,1,THIS HOTEL IS FANTASTIC. I stayed way Chicago towards Arizona; could believe great quality hotel. I'd thought I Vegas suite. Really polite staff; great housekeeping; amazing prices. On way out; I telling manager much I'd loved hotel; even offered extra night there! You safely say trip delayed roughly 24 hours.
1,0,I stayed hotel week I looking forward stay top class hotel. I shocked disapointed stay; Here gripes - Room broken phone broken lightbulb - Breakfast service slow impolite - Hotel rationed shampoo (one bottle two people sharing refill bottle less half full). - We also shared bar soap. I disappointed hotel; I paid premium hotel got disappointing stay.
1,0,If love Brick Walls Alleyways; view you. I asked room facing river; I get room facing Brick Wall. That really pissed off. From great reviews; I expecting better. Before I came here; I stayed Hyatt NYC; awesome. There nothing hotel blew away. The wine hour ok. I hoping would something better food; I guess that's it's wine hour. I ordered room service one night. There wasn't really anywhere eat it; I eat bed watch tv. This first time coming Chicago; I think last. Just thoroughly disappointed.
0,0,talbotthotel - Stayed Talbott last trip Chicago; thought I'd try loving Whitehall street. Unfortunately; I didn't like Talbott much better. The rooms seemed little dark taste; bathrooms tad small. While hotel close main areas Chicago; resulted lot traffic noise room (nothing like late-night honking in-room movie). The hotel amenities reasonable quality frankly worth price.
0,0,Hello; I recently stayed Affinia hotel Chicago; unhappy I learned additional charges upon arrival. When I made reservations phone mention internet parking fees. When I arrive I'm told fee valet park $49 per day; plus another $10 internet. This plain ridiculous; remember stay future. There's many fine hotels don't charge fees.
0,1,Omni Hotel Chicago - I stayed Omni hotel I Chicago business trip. I checked online pleased know keys waiting front desk. The room spacious nice comfortable bed; large bathroom hot shower. The view room great even though I could hear little noise outside; disturb sleep. Room service staff friendly extremely helpful. The Wi-Fi bandwidth good helped access work computer without hassles disconnections. The hotel close I worked also Magnificent Mile several shopping attractions theatres.
1,0,This hotel worth it. From moment walked hotel lobby check out; staff rude contemptuous. Rooms serviceable; certainly live pompous self-descriptions website. The bathroom porthole sliding door odd inconvenient. The 'fitness centre' tiny poor. We would come again.
0,1,Swissotel Chicago - I booked classic king room interview Chicago. The room pretty large price. The modern stype decoration gave great mood interview.
0,1,Great hotel beautiful scenery! The staff wonderful rooms comfortable spacious. They even docking station iPod!
1,1,We stayed great reviews; it's true. We highly impressed high quality everything; everyone; location. Walking distance much Chicago offer. Gibson's steakhouse Hancock building name couple. This hotel really top ten even top five hotels Chicago. It also three stars. I mean three stars hilton garden inn marriott courtyard; place far exceeds chain hotels like those. Depending room get; price $250 would good deal. Between 250 - 300 could still worth it.
1,1,Stayed Junior Suite beautiful spacious. It largest flat screen tv I ever seen hotel (great excuse catch movies) The breakfast buffet great served hotels huge atrium nice. The service top notch. Stayed lower floor East tower great waits elevator always empty. The Shed aquarium complete waste time money Field musium amazing. Chicago remains tied London favourite city.
1,1,I stayed Swissotel business trip first week Aug 2007. I arrived late first night got shoved hospitality room first night. However; made strong talk assigned corner room 28th floor. EXCELLENT view city; river Lake Michigan. In fact; I would say corner room Swissotel better view hotel vicinity. The room huge; everything clean bathroom nice. The hotel convieniently located Magnificient Mile Millenium Park. Would much recommend hotel; would suggest trying every method possible get corner room higher floor.
0,1,We stayed Millennium Knickerbocker last week really wonderful. First off; staff excellent. All needs addressed quickly smile. The hotel really perfect launching pad us take everything Chicago offer. All shopping Michigan Avenue steps room. We decided go Shedd Aquarium package. We started day really wonderful breakfast hotel thoroughly enjoyed "all access pass" aquarium (very cool!). After long days sightseeing (and quick stop wonderful martini bar); nice come back room elegant; comfortable sanctuary busy city. To top off; incredible shower I've ever used (and; even better; it's "green"). What I say? The Millennium Knickerbocker huge part made vacation wonderful memorable. I highly recommend it!
0,1,Amalfi Hotel Chicago minutes Navy Pier; Michigan Avenue; Chicago Opera Theater; The House Blues; hottest night clubs. At $200.00 per night; expect best staff; accomodations. When I arrived weekend stay; I greeted pleasant surprise wall art; eclectic style. After reaching room; I able relax peace numerous pillows. I didn't choose use spa trip; I come back; first item list! The business office great; I last minute emergency work- thank goodness cocktail hour. Breakfast delicious. I already told friend Naperville next time I'm town; she'll stay Amalfi me; instead commuting. She really missed out! -Atlanta Girl-
0,1,My wife stayed Amalfi Hotel Chicago last August weekend visit Chicago. The hotel located 20 W Kinzie St; well-known River North District. We got hotel promised: gentle staff; luxury room breathtaking view; magnificent meals select wine. I also used well-equipped gymnasium. We paid $586 taxes two nights. I think good price; taking account excellent conditions got there. I would recommend Amalfi Hotel anybody good taste visits Chicago.
0,0,The Swissotel Chicago hotel aspires tourist's paradise; hotel grand luxurious you'd rather stay return home end trip. But really magnificent suggested? True; get massage; rooms flat screen T.V.s iPod docks; heck; there's even gym. But truth is; you're really paying much things don't really need. The Swissotel attempts lure illusions grandeur; really; you're getting Holiday Inn style room fancy wallpaper ability play tunes mp3 player. Overpriced dining options available Palm Restaurant. They claim serve excellent lobster; yet I ordered size craw fish; left taste burnt fifty dollar bill mouth. This hotel hides behind velvet curtain; hoping facade won't revealed.
0,0,On recent weekend stay Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel; disappointed. I chose hotel scouring various hotel websites area. From look website; expectations average. I felt website led one believe upscale. Upon arrival; checked in. I shown room first glance everything seemed fine room. As settling room; I began notice general lack cleanliness. I noticed spiderwebs corners; lack cleanliness bathroom. Also; advertised pod docking station room; however; work I call bring replacement. I; guest call down; items checked ensure work properly guest checks in. I found restaurants site crowded; loud mention unusally long wait served meal. I inquire menu items waiter seemed lack knowledge menu items. Overall; experience good next time I area; I chose another hotel stay.
1,1,We returned girls shopping /sight-seeing trip.The Palmer House like home away home.The hotel undergoing renovations notice inconveniences hear noise work.The lobby breathtaking; dressed Christmas.The staff check-in housekeeping welcoming friendly.Our room updated two beds two separate baths great everyone personal space.I would hesitate recommend hotel anyone.Chicago great town.
0,1,My husband I stayed Palmer House Hilton Chicago anniversary. The hotel beautiful luxurious one would expect Hilton brand hotel major city. The service excellent check-in check-out going smoothly. The location hotel ideal us plans attend theater; visit Lincoln Park zoo picnic lake. All close hotel. The price reasonable location luxurious accommodations. We also enjoyed hotel restaurant lounge. Highly recommend.
1,1,Great location - right Chicago River - away skyscraper hotels - room good size; clean nice river view - Overall; great staff - particular I would like point Christy Morgan - Chief Experience Officer Paula Fortney - Concierge assistance making stay memorable one - (in interests full disclosure; stayed AMEX - Starwood points)
0,0,Intercontinental Chicago - This place OK; OK!! I stayed Intercontinental Chicago recent visit last month; I think lost 4 half star quality. The rooms spacious looked outdated. The wallpaper old bathroom particularly standards. The internet poor especially floor use complaining! Its location still convenient charm gone. I try options next trip.
0,1,This great hotel; one nicest stayed long time. My wife absolutely thrilled staff couldn't believe KimptonKids program site. We back next time stop town. We cannot think better place stay.
0,1,This hotel great! I love interior design room. Customer service excellent! And gym spa gorgeous. If need go Chicago; hotel would best choice! You also check website special offer; I found great deal it!
1,0,This hotel shambles-furniture literally falling apart staff rude uninformed; nevermind lack security absence so-called amenities. The "fitness center" oversized closet! We appalled stay! Truly anticipated "warm; Irish hospitality" short barman; one Irish; warm hospitable! Manager unresponsive needs front desk attendent incredibly rude made simple request. Her manager (?) refused come office called ask speak us. Room pretty first glance dresser drawers fell major construction hospital next door began 7:30am kind experience anyone could tolerate. To call Red Roof Inn would insult RRI! The manager finally called us back soooo fake insincere would prefered call all. The thing going location worth trade-off.
0,0,This hotel rather far airport traffic took almost 2 hours get there. By time; I tired I ready check room. I stood line forever one person working front desk. That beginning. It noisy outside people constantly walking around. I guess it's they're located middle downtown area; could least make walls thicker. I don't want hear everything going neighbor's room. The bathroom clean one towels hole it. The toilet ran night kept along people street. The restaurant food horrible I would rather buy food street vendor pay ridiculously high price charged burger. Overall; I disappointed stay Conrad Chicago.
1,0,My wife I frequently stay downtown night city. We many hotels downtown Chicago area. My opinion Swissotel - spend money elsewhere get much better experience. The Swissotel 'cold' atmosphere difficult feel comfortable. The room average best however cost per night far average. The view room faced construction site soon trump building block lake view hotel. Other hotels also couple blocks closer action cost would expect more. Our room lobby areas strange smell someone actually vacuuming hallway floors 8:00a woke us up. We called front desk complain extremely shocked treated rudely person desk. We also couple friends come downtown waiting lobby approached gentleman asking guests hotel. They said waiting us actually asked names looked verify guest register. He didnt even apologize inconvenience imbarrassment. Overall unpleasant experience expecting top notch treatment. Spend money nicer hotel lake Michigan avenue real top notch service. Anyone giving hotel top review obviously hasnt opportunity stay nicer hotel area.
0,0,While hotel certainly seems look beautiful; hotel actually far it. Even booking room online rather difficult; wasn't able reach representative upon calling contact numbers. In general coming bad decision despite looks; mistake wont make shouldn't either.
