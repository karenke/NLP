begin.v 0 1 0 0 0 @ Accidental stalls seldom happen when the glider is being flown straight , and most result in one wing stalling before the other , causing a wing - drop . Incipient spins Any time that a wing @begins@ to drop at a stall it is the beginning of a possible spin , but the spin can only develop if the wing is kept stalled and the glider is allowed to continue to yaw . In the UK there has been much discussion about teaching stall recoveries with a view to making it all easier for the beginner to understand and remember . It has been suggested that incipient is an unfamiliar word , that associating the stall with a spin might get the student worried , and that to simplify things we should only talk about stalls and spins .
